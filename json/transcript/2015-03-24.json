  "text" : [ "Thanks for your humour and understanding, Speaker; much appreciated.", "There are a few things I just want to say at the outset of this debate. First of all, we’re going to be supporting this bill. I think it goes a long way to addressing some of the issues that deal with having to control evasive species in the province of Ontario. But as with every bill, the devil is in the details in regard to what this bill actually will end up doing, what it will end up costing and how effective it’s going to be. That’s what I’d like to spend my time talking about because, as we know, this bill should pass second reading, and I would imagine it will. The government’s proposing this bill, so it’s a government bill. More than likely this bill will pass second reading. It will go into committee and we’ll get a chance, when this gets into committee, to be able to get into some of the issues that I want to raise in this particular debate.", "The first thing I just want to say is, I don’t think anybody in this House—and I think probably hardly anybody in this province—is going to argue that we don’t have a problem when it comes to evasive species. We saw what happened with various evasive species that have introduced themselves into our ecosystem here in Ontario: everything from what was dragged in from the oceans through the Great Lakes in regard to zebra mussels and other species that have migrated here by way of attaching themselves to seafaring ships that end up inside our Great Lakes system to—what ends up happening is just products being shipped by air and by rail from around North America and around the world that end up here in Ontario and eventually end up in our environment.", "What that could mean, quite frankly, to the ecosystem in those areas—we all see it driving down the highways, at least where I come from. Purple loosestrife is abundant and pretty plentiful across most ditches across Ontario. It’s actually quite a pretty flower, and I know the bees like it, but it is a problem when it comes to other species that it comes into contact with.", "I guess the question becomes—and this is really the fundamental question—how effectively can any legislation deal with any of that? I think we shouldn’t delude ourselves at the very beginning. There’s no way in heck, if this bill was perfect, that you’re going to eliminate the threat of evasive species in the province of Ontario. Some of the ways by which evasive species end up coming into this province and are introduced into our ecosystem may be out of our control, to a certain degree.", "Now, it’s not to say that we shouldn’t be doing something, it’s not to say we shouldn’t support this legislation; obviously, this legislation is a step in the right direction. I think the general point that I’m trying to make is that with all the plans of mice and men, at the end of the day nature will have its way. So let’s not pat ourselves on the back and walk away from this exercise to say, “Oh, my God, look at this. The Legislature of Ontario, we have on such-and-such a date passed such-and-such a bill that is going to eliminate evasive species from being introduced in the ecosystem of Ontario.” Because the fact is that we will still have evasive species that’ll be introducing themselves into our province. No matter how hard we work at it and no matter how good we are it, we’re going to always have that problem.", "So let’s be clear: What this is is an attempt in order to try to deal with those things that we can have an effect on, by way of good public policy and by way of being able to control how these particular species end up in our ecosystem. That’s just generally the first comment I want to make.", "The second thing I want to say: As I read through this bill—and I encourage members to read this bill because I think it’s indicative of what is the problem in this Legislature to a great extent—much of what’s going to happen in this bill is going to be covered by regulation. We, as legislators who stand here today who are debating and eventually will pass a bill that will go into law, really have no idea what the bill’s going to look like in the end, Mr. Speaker, because the regulations that are to be drafted by cabinet are not subject to this Legislature’s approval.", "We, for whatever reason, got ourselves down this path of delegating the authority of the Legislature to regulation and to cabinet to do what they want when it comes to regulation. I think that’s unfortunate because I think that regulations should reflect what it is that the legislators wanted at the very beginning. I would hope that we would go back to the day where regulation was done in such—first of all, delegating our authority for cabinet to make decisions about legislation by putting everything into regulation used to be not the norm, it used to be the exception, in this place.", "When we were passing legislation in the House, the bills were thicker—no question, they were more voluminous—they took longer to draft because they were much more complicated, but the bill actually dealt with, “In the case of X, this is what the minister shall do; in the case of Y, this is what the minister may do.” It was pretty well spelled out in the legislation what the bill was intended to do and how it was going to happen. That’s the way that legislation was drafted in this House for over 100 years.", "For whatever reasons—and we can all point to each other in this place because we’ve all been in government in the last 20-some-odd years in this place—we have more and more devolved the power of this Legislature to the corner office of the Premier and to cabinet. I think that’s unfortunate because what you end up with is the Legislature pronouncing itself on something, deciding to take a collective decision to do whatever that is, and then cabinet goes off and does what the heck it wants.", "I will give you a bill as an example that orchestrates this, and I have raised this before. Back in the day there was a Premier by the name of Bob Rae. Bob Rae decided that he wanted to introduce casinos in the province of Ontario, to the chagrin of some. There were people in this province at the time, as there are now, who believed we should have never brought casinos to the province of Ontario. I’m not one of them; I was actually in favour of casinos being established in Ontario.", "But the point is this: The Conservatives then, who were the third party, took the position that casinos should not be allowed to be established in a community unless there was a referendum where the public in that community has the say. So what ended up happening is that when the NDP was defeated and the Conservatives took office, they introduced a bill in this House, and the bill essentially said that in the future, with any casino to be established in the province of Ontario, there needs to be a referendum. This House debated that bill. This House passed that bill. Quite frankly, it was probably not a bad idea. But all of the details as to what would be in the referendum and whether there was going to be a referendum was left to regulation. This House passed a bill that said, “There shall be a referendum any time a new casino is established in Ontario.” The House pronounced itself on that at second and third reading. The bill was passed into law and it was enacted. The difficulty: All of the detail was in the regulation. Then, some years later, when Dalton McGuinty became the Premier of Ontario, he decided by regulation that there would be no referendum at the establishment of any casino in the province of Ontario.", "Well, Speaker, that is not what this House decided. What this House decided at the time was, “There shall be a referendum.” It seems to me that what should have happened, if we had not delegated our authority as we did on that particular bill, is that the government would have been forced to come into this House and to bring a bill to say, “We are changing so that there no longer needs to be a referendum,” and this House could have pronounced itself on that idea, either yes or no, up and down.", "That’s the problem when you start delegating authority. If you look at this bill, Speaker, much of the detail—I would say about 90% of the detail as to how this bill is going to work—is going to be left to the minister and is going to be left to the cabinet to decide by regulation. They’re going to decide what is an evasive species. It’s not going to be some mechanism that we understand now at second reading; it’s going to be something that’s going to be established in regulation after this bill is passed. How is the evasive species strategy going to deal with trying to deal with the evasive species? All of those questions are left to regulation. It just seems me that this is an issue that all of us have something to say about. The details by which this is to work should at the very least be inside the bill so that we understand clearly what it is we are trying to do by way of strategies to deal with evasive species.", "How can the public comment on this bill in committee effectively if they don’t have what’s in—there’s nothing in the bill at this point, second reading, that deals with the specifics of how we are going to identify evasive species and what the strategies are going to be to deal with evasive species. The only thing we know for sure is what the fines will be: up to $250,000—is it $250,000 or $250 million? Is it thousand or million? It has to be thousand." ],

I believe that’s something that still has to be spelled out in law, because only this Legislature can deal with those issues. But that’s about the only thing we’re certain about. We’re not certain as to the mechanisms by which we will identify and then deal with evasive species.", "So when the public and those people interested in dealing with evasive species issues come to the committee, they’re going to be able to pronounce themselves generally on the issue, but they’re going to have a heck of a hard time trying to hone in on, how is the strategy going to work, what is the government really proposing, does it make sense, should it be adjusted, is it strong enough, is it too strong? You can’t pronounce yourself on any of that stuff because we don’t know. It’s essentially like holding up a bill that has a title and the inside of the bill is blank. We know what the title of the bill is, we know the effect of what the government wants, but we have no idea of what the details are going to be.", "Now, I realize that for most government members who sit on the back bench and most cabinet ministers and, I would argue, for a whole bunch of opposition members, we don’t think about the danger of delegating authority to cabinet. It’s not the top-of-mind issue that everybody thinks about—" ],

But that was, again, a decision by cabinet.", "My point is, if we end up in the situation that we are in now where we draft legislation and everything is left to regulation, it beckons the question, what is this Legislature doing, delegating its authority to cabinet? Legislation should be drafted in such a way that is more prescriptive, that describes what the government wants to do and how they’re going do it. That would be the first comment that I would make.", "The other comment I want to make is—you look at the Ministry of Natural Resources. What this bill is going to do—which is a good idea—is they are going to take the myriad of ministries and the myriad of policies that exist out there, the different ministries that deal with evasive species, and put them all under one roof and have one authority to deal with it: one minister. Okay, I think that makes an ample amount of sense. Imagine trying to fight the Second World War and you had 15 generals trying to essentially lead the Battle of Stalingrad or whatever it might be. It wouldn’t make any sense. You have to have one person who is in charge, who at the end of the day listens to all of the advice but makes the decision. If we’re going to have a battle on evasive species—and I think the war example is a little bit harsh. But my point is, I agree you have to have somebody who is heading up the charge, somebody who ultimately makes the decision about how we’re going to do this and what we’re going to do and all of that kind of stuff, based on what’s in the legislation.", "The problem is that the Ministry of Natural Resources is one of those ministries that has been targeted, over the next three years, to lose 6% per year. I repeat: The Ministry of Natural Resources, according to the last budget—the progressive Kathleen Wynne budget that the NDP voted against—has a 6% reduction over the next three years, that they lose each year over the next three years in their budget. How are they going to pay for this?", "Here is the question: Who is going to be left at the Ministry of Natural Resources to shut off the lights as they walk out of the room? Who are going to be the inspectors? Who are going to be the field staff who deal with the science necessary to deal with what are the evasive species and what the targets should be and how we deal with the elimination of that evasive species? Who is going to do this work if you don’t have people at the ministry who are capable of doing that because they don’t have the staff anymore? The MNR, the Ministry of Natural Resources, has shut down the entire scientific division of the MNR; it’s gone. That was under the progressive government of the Liberals. Remember those progressives? They talked about, “Oh, my God, we campaigned from the left.” But God, did they govern from the right." ],

Really, the endangered species here is the progressive Liberal. That’s the endangered species, if we were talking about endangered species. I wanted to use that line. My good friend Mr. Vanthof came up with that this morning.", "My point is, there’s hardly the capacity within the Ministry of Natural Resources today, and we know that the Ministry of Natural Resources is going to lose 6% funding each and every year for the next three years. Who is going to do this? Who is going to do the work that has to be done to deal with evasive species?", "So here’s the situation—because we’re seeing it in other areas of the Ministry of Natural Resources, and I only use that ministry as an example. There are all kinds of legislative obligations that that ministry has. It administers the Public Lands Act; it administers a number of acts dealing with how we approach fishing and hunting in our province; it deals with the quarries act; it deals with a whole bunch of different legislation that they are legislatively obligated to carry out mandates of, given to them by this Legislature. They can’t do it now.", "Mr. Speaker, if you went into your local Ministry of Natural Resources office and said, “I want to exercise my right as an Ontarian in order to get a land use permit from the Ministry of Natural Resources,” you wouldn’t even be allowed to apply. Why? Not because the legislation says that you cannot have a land use permit. Of course, legislation permits land use permits. The Legislature decided some years ago that where there is crown land and somebody has a use for it and it’s not being sold, you can enter into an agreement with the Ministry of Natural Resources to have a land use permit to do whatever it is that you’re trying to do, provided it’s within the context of what makes some sense for us from a policy perspective in the Ministry of Natural Resources. But you can’t even get the permit today. Do you know why? There’s no money. There’s nobody in the ministry capable of dealing with the application for a land use permit.", "In my part of the world, we get a fair amount of these kinds of requests: people trying to get land use permits for everything from trying to set up a place for people to be able to do some collective camping, to people trying to operate a business, let’s say a campground or something like that, and they need a certain part of land in order to do whatever. You can’t even get the permit anymore. So they go to the ministry to apply for the ministry permit that they’re entitled to get, they go online—I don’t even know if you can still get it online; I know you could at one point—and nobody is there to process the application. They’re told, “We’re not taking any applications for land use permits.” So how in heck are this ministry and this minister going to deal with evasive species when we don’t even have the capacity to process the land use permit within the ministry? They don’t have the staff at the MNR to be able to do this.", "There’s a whole section in the bill—I forget what the section number is—that deals with the minister having the power to name the people who will be responsible for doing the inspections and stuff. My question is, who is that? We’re going to give it to conservation officers? I think there’s, what, 250 conservation officers in the province of Ontario, who already have a whole bunch of work to do because they’ve been chopped greatly over the last number of years.", "I was talking to somebody who used to work at the MNR, who is now retired, in Timmins. We were talking about how when I was first elected there were 60 MNR staff at the Timmins office and 57 MNR staff at the Gogama office. We’re down to 30 staff between both offices. Who is left to do the work?", "We’re going to give conservation officers the job of enforcing the invasive species act legislation? God, they can’t even get gas to get in their trucks sometimes, as was the case when the Tories were in power. You couldn’t get gas in your truck to go drive in the bush to make sure that people were fishing and hunting according to the law. So I’m asking, who’s going to do this?", "Again, it brings me to the other issue that I’ve raised in this house a number of times: Governments and, I would argue, private members have a habit of introducing legislation in this House without any thought of how we’re going to pay for it. In the case of the opposition and private members, we cannot propose a bill that costs money, so we’re kind of exonerated from any blame at that point. But every bill that the government brings forward has a financial implication of some type. This bill is one that’s going to cost money.", "You have, essentially, a $12-billion deficit currently and a government that doesn’t seem to have a plan to deal with balancing the books by 2017-18, as they said they would, and we’re going to add costs to the Ministry of Natural Resources, if you were to actually do this bill right. You would have to add costs to the treasury of Ontario to be able to make this bill work.", "Again, I’m not arguing against this bill. I’m just raising a philosophical point: When bringing legislation to the floor of the Legislature, you would think that cabinet would look at the Minister of Finance and say, “Hey, Mr. Sousa, do we have the money to do this?” If they didn’t have that conversation, I say, shame on them. If that discussion wasn’t had at the cabinet table, when it comes to whether you have the money to carry out the mandate of this legislation, then it tells me we’re in a lot bigger trouble than we think we are.", "You wonder why you have a $12-billion deficit? Fourteen years of Liberal government doing this kind of stuff without the context of how you’re going to pay for it adds up after a point in time.", "Listen, they’re not responsible for the entire $12 billion. I recognize the economy had a great part to do with that. Health care services, schools and roads still need to be maintained. Those services have to be given, and those costs are going up. I have sympathy for the government trying to deal with a pretty difficult financial situation. I don’t care who you are; you have to deal with that.", "But my point that I’m making—okay, fine, you brought this legislation to the table. Nowhere did I hear in the minister’s speech and nowhere did I see in any of the literature that came out with this legislation how much this bill is going to cost the treasury of Ontario over the next number of years and what the strategy is to pay for that. I think that would be incumbent.", "Imagine, in your own personal finances, if you decide: “Well, I just got a new policy that my wife and I are going to take a trip every year for two weeks to Europe.” What a great policy. Murielle and I will be dancing down the aisles thinking about all the great places we get to go for two weeks every year. But imagine if you did that without the context of saying, “Well, honey, it means to say that we have to put so much money away every month. It means we have to cut back on expenses here in order to make sure we have the money to take that holiday. Then maybe we can afford to take that holiday.” Who, in their personal finances—unless they are living off their credit card, and that’s going to come to an end at one point—doesn’t say, “All right, we’ve made a policy decision in our household: two weeks to Europe every year. You better have figured out how you’re going to pay for it before you implement that decision”? That’s what most of us do in our families. That’s what most people do in small businesses. That’s what happens—not always in large businesses. Large business, I would argue, is a lot like government. You want to waste money? The bigger the business, the more money you can waste. This whole fallacy that the private sector does it better—go take a look at large corporations. They’re not any different than government. They are like crazy cabinets that we have over here, and of a different stripe. They do bad decisions well.", "My point is, any time that the government ever comes with any kind of declaration of how they’re going to pay for this—now, again, I want to say as a New Democrat that I support this legislation. I think this legislation is long overdue. I think we have to have a strategy to deal with evasive species. But I’m also a practical New Democrat who says, “Okay, how are we going to pay for this?”", "I will remind you of somebody by the name of Tommy Douglas. When Tommy Douglas came to government back in Saskatchewan in the late 1940s, early 1950s, what was the first thing that Tommy Douglas did? Everybody says, “Oh, he did health care.” No, no, no, no.

I’m just saying up front here, my friends in the Liberal Party, very good direction as far as legislation. It’s not the way I would have written the bill, but good stuff. But please tell me how you’re going to pay for this. I hope that the parliamentary assistant for agriculture comments on this when he is back and gets a chance to respond to it, because I would like to know how they are going to pay for the protection under the evasive species.", "The other thing in this particular bill that you’ve got to take a look at—first of all, we’re delegating the authority of the cabinet, so we don’t know what this bill is going to look like, other than the title says we’re going to deal with evasive species. How they’re going to do that, God only knows. Cabinet will figure out the details and we’re going to find out by way of a press release some time after the bill is passed. I want to come back to that, because I think it speaks to what we need to do legislatively here to fix that.", "Not only have they not decided how they’re going to pay for this, or told us how they’re going to pay for it, but when you take a look at the legislation, the legislation itself is somewhat ambiguous when it comes to deciding who is going to be responsible for enforcing the policies made by cabinet when it comes to dealing with evasive species. If you look at what the bill says, the bill doesn’t describe, “It’s going to be the Ministry of Natural Resources and these particular people who are responsible for carrying out what is established under the bill and the regulation.” It says the minister will decide that by way of regulation. This may end up becoming some private corporation, because we know that this government, God, they love the private sector. The Liberals, I tell you, are outflanking the Conservatives on the right. Everything is private sector.

That might be a conservation officer, maybe, or it might be—and I think more likely—somebody in the private sector who is going to be contracted to do this. They might go and decide to get a deal with a not-for-profit to do this.

That’s why they don’t have to talk about cost: Because it’s plausible that the municipalities and the LSBs are going to be responsible for enforcing what’s under this bill.", "The government, in this bill, is essentially being pretty vague not only about how they’re going to pay for this—they’re pretty vague about what they’re going to do and how they’re going to do it—but they’re also being pretty vague about who’s going to carry out the mandate of this bill. This could take the form of privatization and it could take the form of downloading on municipalities. That’s just from my reading this bill a couple of times, what I’ve been able to come up with as I read through the bill.", "It came back to the point of, why do we draft bills in this way? Because it’s to the advantage of the government. The government can go off and do what it wants to do.", "Speaker, I would argue that what’s needed in this Legislature are probably two things in order to deal with these types of bills, where everything is left to regulation. I think the first thing is that we should stop delegating the authority of this House to the cabinet. Yes, there are times when we need to do that. I understand that. I’ve been around here long enough to know that cabinet does need to deal with some of these things, because the ministry has got to go off and work out some of the details. But at the very most, that should be the exception to the rule, not the rule. So we should, first of all, very much diminish our reliance on putting everything in regulation.", "The second thing I think we need do is to make some changes at our committee level when it comes to dealing with regulation. Currently, we are very limited as members. Even the government is limited, with their members, in being able to call any regulation before the committee for review.", "For example, there should be a mechanism that says: If the government is going to draft regulations for this bill, once the regulations are done, they should come back as a package to a committee of this Legislature where, at least, the committee has to approve or turn down the regulation. At least this way, the committee would be able to say, “You know what? No, we don’t want to approve this and we’re kicking this back to the House. Let the government deal with coming back and bringing a better product than the regulations they’ve put forward.” In that way, at least the will of the House is maintained—the idea of Parliament being the place by which we not only decide on the authority to spend money, but how money is spent, is dealt with in the Legislature.", "I don’t argue that any member of this House, including a cabinet minister, should ever micromanage a ministry. I know my good friend Madeleine Meilleur—I’ve known her for a lot of years—is not a micromanager. I don’t believe micromanaging how our civil servants do their jobs is what we have to do in this Legislature. But I do believe that we have to set the general policy direction. The problem now is that once the cabinet has decided what’s going to go into the regulation—we need to have a mechanism so that the regulation comes back to us in some form so we’re able to see what the government has done.", "Oh, yes, the government will get up and say, “Oh, but Gilles, it’s not a problem. You’ll be able to get all the regulations on the Ontario Gazette the Monday after they are filed.” Yes, I get to see them, I get to read them, but do any members of this House have any say on what is in those regulations? Should the regulations stand as done under what’s printed in the Gazette?", "For those people who don’t know what I’m talking about, every week the Ontario government puts out what they call the Ontario Gazette. There is a requirement for cabinet: that any time they pass a regulation, the regulation be posted in that Gazette so that everybody can see what’s happened. I encourage all members to read the Gazette on Mondays, especially under their ministry portfolios, in order to keep an eye on what’s going on with regulation.", "My point is, there has to be a mechanism, I think, at the very least, so that where we decide in legislation to delegate the authority in some bills—and maybe we don’t have to do it with all bills—once the regulations are written, the regulations come back to a committee so that the committee can decide what the next step is. Do we need to do more public consultation? In other words, these would be draft regulations that would be sent to the committee.", "The draft regulations that would be created by cabinet would come to the committee. The committee would say, “Okay, you know what? We need a couple of weeks of hearings here,” or “We need a couple of days of hearings”—so that the stakeholders who came and spoke to us have a chance to look at this and give us their opinion—and actually fix the regulation so that it does what it is supposed to do.", "I’ll give you an example of why that is so important.", "When Mike Harris was elected Premier, back in 1995, they decided that they wanted to change the assessment system in the province of Ontario.", "Ontario had, up until about 1993, a system of assessment that had been around for a long, long time. It was pretty simple. The value of a building in 1957 had been established. They took the value of the building—I think it was 1957—and they would essentially value what that building in 1957 was worth today. So the assessment was a frozen assessment, in 1957. A whole bunch of people pointed out, correctly, the problem is that the house may have been renovated since 1957, and you need to have a mechanism to be able to properly show the value of the house as of today, when dealing with the assessment.", "The government of Ontario, then under Bob Rae, passed legislation in this House that went to market value assessment. The assessment was based on what the house was worth when the house was being valued at whatever date the evaluation happened, every two years.", "The government of Mike Harris was opposed to that and voted against it when we were in government and they were the third party, and rightfully so.

I was noticing that, the way they were drafting the bill, there were actually going to be problems. I was lucky enough to sit on the original committee, back in 1992-93, that dealt with this the first time, so I had a gross understanding of the issue. I was by no means an expert on it—I still am not—but I pointed out to the committee members of the day, “Listen, there’s a problem with the way this bill is drafted, because you’re leaving all of this to regulation, and some of this doesn’t actually jive.”", "It took five bills, after the actual value assessment bill was passed at third reading—four other bills were introduced into this House and had to be passed in order to fix the problems with the initial bill that had been put in place by the Tories in 1996.", "I say that just as a warning of what happens when we don’t do our jobs effectively by way of drafting bills. If the bill had been drafted the way that bills normally are drafted—which is that the details are in the bill, not in the regulation—those who came before the committee would have been able to see what the problems were and point out, “Well, no, this doesn’t work, for this practical reason.” The government—rightfully so—could have amended their bill in order to be able to deal with it. But they didn’t.", "That’s why I’m saying that if you’re not going to stop the delegation of authority to cabinet, you at least have to have a mechanism where draft regulations come back to a committee, and that committee is allowed to look at and decide what the next step should be.", "The other thing I just want to touch on—I’m just taking a look at my notes here.

Section 27 says that if an area has been designated an evasive species control area or declared an invasive place, and efforts to address the significant threat have so far failed, the minister can use whatever means necessary to remove the eradicated species, whether or not resulting in damage to property or something is moved or destroyed. That means to say we’re giving the minister pretty strong powers. You, Mr. Speaker, own two acres of land somewhere in your community. There’s an evasive species somewhere around the area.

Why aren’t we hearing how they’re going to pay for this, in the sense of what it’s going to cost? And who in the end is actually going to carry out these particular responsibilities that we describe in the bill? We certainly know the Ministry of Natural Resources, as they are now, lack the capacity to even do what they’ve got under their current mandate, without throwing another one at them. Nobody in this House, as far as the minister, the PA or any other member of the government, has told us how much they figure this bill is going to cost.", "I would think, in a day—especially as this government is on an austerity kick these days and trying to say that they’re going to balance this budget somehow or other. I’m not sure how they’re going to do that, but that’s a whole other thing. You would think that the government would at least come forward and say, “Okay, we estimate it’s going to cost us X. This is how we expect to be able to pay for it. This is what we think we can do, given the current fiscal room that we have or the fiscal realities of what the province of Ontario has to offer.” I think most of us here would then be able to say, “Okay, we get it. You’re trying to bite off a problem this big, but you can only afford to bite off this much of the problem, and that’s because of resources and how much money you’ve got. We understand that.” We can at least look each other in the eye and be truthful to each other about what we’re actually going to be able to accomplish with this particular bill.", "I just want to also bring a couple of local points on this particular bill, just to say that in northern Ontario we are seeing—I’m seeing in my riding, as I’m sure you guys are in yours—that there is an issue with evasive species. We don’t have many of the problems that you have down in the Great Lakes, but we’re seeing the migration of evasive species from southern Ontario—invasive species—starting to move their way north further and further. We’re seeing the slow creep as they start moving their way northwards.", "For example, one of the things that we’ve seen is people who ferry boats to go fishing or to go boating from one lake to another don’t do a very good job cleaning off the bottom of their boats. They take the boat from lake A and they move it 100 miles or 200 miles north, south, east or west and they drop it into another lake somewhere else. As a result, they’re moving a species or they’re moving something that may be natural in the other lake but is not sustainable in the lake that they’re going to. So things like that have to be dealt with as well.", "It’s a hard one to deal with, because what do you do? Most of the lakes I come from, when we go fishing—there’s no pump there, there’s no pressurized water system to be able to wash off the bottom of your boat as you pull it off the Mattagami River or you pull it off Rufus Lake or wherever it is that you might be going. It really is incumbent upon the person who owns the boat to say, “Okay, I know that I’ve pulled this thing off Rufus and I’m going to be going to Lake X in a couple of weeks, so I’ll bring the boat home and I’ll wash it off.” I think there needs to be a bit more education done as far as campaigns on the television, on radio, whatever, to let people know that you do have a responsibility as a boat owner to make sure that, in fact, you do clean off the hull of your boat when you’re moving it from one lake to the other.", "Listen, we’re all guilty. I’ve got probably around three or four boats and I’m one of those people who moves it from Kamiskotia Lake to Round Lake to Winter Lake, and I probably very seldom have done that. As I look at this bill, it reminds me that I have a responsibility, as other people have a responsibility, to make sure that we, in fact, don’t contaminate other lakes as we move from one lake to the other in the area.", "Now, I would argue, moving from Kamiskotia to Round Lake is probably not a big deal, because it’s pretty well the same—" ],

The member opposite talked about the fact that there is no invasive species listed in the bill. In fact, our government is going to put forward regulations to list those invasive species. In cases where a threat requires immediate action, the minister would have the authority to temporarily designate a significant-threat invasive species. But in terms of broader consultation, this is going to occur via the EBR, the environmental and regulatory registries, before any species would be listed—this further to already significant consultation that has taken place.", "That consultation, which has already taken place, coupled with the EBR responses-—which I know will be significant, and that the member opposite will encourage his constituencies to participate in—will serve to guide us. Both those things will be strengthened by the scientists—numerous, I’m happy to say, in the ministry—extremely knowledgeable, that will serve to guide this legislation as it moves forward. I look forward to the constructive debate in the House on this important bill, given its importance to our economy, our social fabric and our day-to-day lives.", "In my own riding of Burlington, we have the Cootes to Escarpment right next door, which has the largest number of endangered species anywhere in the country. That, of course, is right next door to the Hamilton harbour, which is in the midst of a very significant cleanup. We have the greenbelt just next door. I’m surrounded by provincial parks and significant green space. Tackling invasive species is going to be a very important issue for all of us to be thinking about and looking at.", "Again, I thank the member opposite for his constructive comments. I look forward to discussing this further in committee." ],

When your economy is threatened, you have to move quickly.", "The world has shrunk. Trade has changed a lot of things. Most of it is very, very positive, but one of the things that has happened is that our world has shrunk, and species from other parts of the globe that have no natural predators here can be transferred to our environment, and they run amok because we don’t have the natural predators that keep those populations in check. It’s happening all across the globe. It’s not just happening here; it’s happening all across the globe. So some kind of legislation that gives us some teeth to deal with these invasive species is very, very necessary.", "We do need to have the debate to make sure that we’re covering the bases and that we’re doing it right, and we get it right the first time. That is why this bill needs to get through to committee, so that we can get the input from those stakeholders and those people that understand the implications and ramifications of this, or any other piece of legislation, better than we do ourselves, because they’re on the ground every day. We may write the legislation and we may pass it here, but I think it’s very important that we get the input from those stakeholders that understand it, quite frankly, better than we ever would.", "We need to get this bill to committee. As my colleague from Timmins–James Bay said, the government has to have an open mind when we get to committee, and if there are constructive elements that can be addressed through amendment, don’t be against them just because they’re coming from the other side." ],

Whether it’s a 100% locked-tight, well-nuanced bill, it will not eliminate invasive species as an entirety. We have to recognize that.", "We also have to recognize that the provisions of constructing this bill through regulation really don’t allow members of this Legislature to provide oversight. So as Monsieur Bisson suggested, when those regulations are finally drafted, they should come back to committee for us as members to be able to comment on them. It’s something that should be a regular course of action in here, but unfortunately, it has not been so for quite some time through the measures that the government has enacted or used to push bills through this House.", "He talked about section 27. I wasn’t aware of that. That is quite frightening. It gives the minister extraordinary powers, should they designate a certain area with a threat of invasive species, to take any action: burn a plot of land, use chemicals that we may not even know of. This is far-reaching—overreaching, I would say—and something that we should take a very close look at, something that could potentially end up being a slippery slope and set a precedent for other areas or other jurisdictions.", "Then something that he mentioned which I think is quite reasonable, something that I think Ontarians would appreciate, is that we travel this bill, that we would do wide consultation, broad consultation. It’s something that affects the entire Great Lakes basin, as we see a continued presence of invasive species. They have lots of voice, they have concerns, and we should certainly give them the opportunity to do that." ],

When I think about my community and how this touches Etobicoke Centre, I think about something called the lamprey eel which, back in the 1960s, we began to address as an invasive species. It really devastated a number of the fish that populate the Great Lakes, trout as an example. Key tributaries are where they were most prominent. We’ve been able to control that, and the impact of that not only for our wildlife but for our economy has been a positive one.", "So when I think about this piece of legislation, I think about things like that. I think about the fact that this is a bill that will ensure that we do a much better job of assessing and preventing these types of species from ravaging our economy and ravaging our green spaces.", "If this legislation is passed, Ontario will actually be the only jurisdiction in Canada that has stand-alone invasive species legislation. I mentioned the lamprey eel, but there are others that we need to be concerned about, like zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer. This costs our economy tens of millions of dollars each year. When we think about the Asian carp, they have the potential to do long-lasting damage to our environmental systems, impacting our $2.2-billion recreational fishing industry in Ontario.", "This is really a critical bill. I think it takes important steps to make sure that we address some of these invasive species. We know what the impact of invasive species can be on our communities, on our green spaces and on our economy. I would urge members from all sides of the House to come together and let’s pass this bill so that we can enact it, move forward with it and reap the positive benefits as soon as possible." ],

The EBR is an opportunity for people to comment on the drafting of regulations, and then cabinet can decide whether to take those comments into consideration when doing the regulations. It’s quite a different thing than an actual legislative committee that has the ability to have public hearings and actually put forward amendments that the government has to deal with, either by voting for or voting against.", "I don’t want to have to rely on the EBR as a way to deal with regulations. The point that I was trying to make in my speech was that there’s a real problem here when we leave all of the details to regulation. It makes us vote on a bill that has a title and we really don’t know what it’s going to do in the end, as far as its effectiveness and how it’s going to be done and how it’s going to be paid for.", "That’s why I argued that we should either put the details of that in the bill or, at the very least, we have to have a mechanism that, once the regulations are drafted by cabinet, those regulations have the ability to be called by a committee—to take a look at the package and, if necessary, re-engage the public in some way; that we’re able to then, as a committee, vote on any amendments that are necessary when it comes to the draft regulations as presented. It just seems to me that in that way it’s a much more transparent system and we actually end up in a way in which we engage the public, where they could have an opportunity to have a real say when it comes to the outcome of the legislation.", "It’s unfortunate that we find ourselves in this situation, because over the last 20-odd years, we have moved more and more towards the delegation of the authority of this House to cabinet.

This is about doing the right thing to protect our farm workers so they can continue their excellent work to produce the good things that are grown, harvested and made right here in Ontario.

Working people in Ontario have seen their wages stagnate while the cost of everyday life keeps climbing.", "There are strikes on our campuses and nurses walking picket lines. There are four OPP investigations into this Liberal government’s corruption.

Enough is enough.", "In the last election, the Conservative Party to my right proudly proclaimed that they planned to cut 100,000 jobs from all across this province. As it turns out, Mr. Speaker, they weren’t the ones with such a plan. While the Liberals were decrying this Conservative plan, it turns out it was actually a Liberal plan, their plan, too. Don Drummond, this Liberal government’s hand-picked banker/cutting expert, said on TVO’s The Agenda that in order to meet their projections, the Liberals would have to cut at least 100,000 jobs.", "Now, they don’t want to talk about this, but it is clear that they aren’t being up front with the people of Ontario. One hundred thousand jobs—these aren’t McJobs; they are good, well-paying middle-class jobs. One hundred thousand jobs across Ontario’s 107 ridings works out to 935 jobs in each riding. So for the people watching at home, including my mom, think about your community. Now imagine it with nearly 1,000 of your neighbours out of work.", "Ontarians sent a strong message against the Conservative and Liberal plan, but this arrogant government, as usual, is not listening. The people of Ontario made it clear in the last election: They rejected a Conservative austerity agenda. But rather than recognize that mandate, this Liberal government has pushed forward with one of the most aggressive austerity agendas this province has ever seen.", "It is said that Liberals like to campaign from the left but that when they get into power they rule from the right, and we are seeing this in action. If this is big-L Liberalism in Ontario, then who needs a Conservative Party? That’s the outstanding question here today. We are watching Tim Hudak’s dream realized by Kathleen Wynne.", "New Democrats rejected the last Liberal budget, and we continue to fight it each and every day.

There are closures across Ontario, and here in Toronto some one in five schools are slated to close in some of Toronto’s most struggling neighbourhoods.", "The last budget cut child care spaces in 18 communities in Ontario. Now we have massive wait-lists and shortages of affordable child care.", "The last budget pushed cuts to transportation infrastructure across the north, where the Liberals have already done so much damage. The north has largely been ignored by this government for too long. Apparently, not satisfied with selling off the ONTC for a loss of nearly $1 billion, we see closures of more bus stations across the north.", "The last budget set the stage for massive privatization and the selloff of our public assets.

Dalton McGuinty, just four short years ago—incredible, isn’t it? Just four short years ago, he grudgingly decided that it was a bad idea.", "The Globe and Mail said, “Selling off prized electricity assets to pay for transit projects smacked more of a cash grab than a considered approach to maximizing value and making sound energy policy.”", "The Financial Post said, “Premier Wynne will discover that there is no juice to be squeezed from Hydro One.

Here are just a few examples of the emails that I’ve received, and I’m sure all of us in this House have received similar ones.", "Jim from Thornhill rightly points out that “this privatization proposal was not on the election ballot. The Wynne government has no mandate to proceed with such asset sales, unless it has the approval of the voters. Selling off hydro was not in your platform.”", "Robert calls the plan “incredibly short-sighted and stupid.”", "Nick from Brampton correctly writes, “Selling Hydro One or any part of it will raise already high electricity prices, which many struggle to pay.”", "Ontarians already pay the highest electricity bills in Canada. Ontarians have suffered a 300% rise in their electricity bills since the Liberals took office, Mr. Speaker. Ontarians will see their bills rise 42% over the next five years. The Liberal response to this is not to address the problem, but rather to give away our hydro system for corporate profit.", "We know how this story ends: even higher bills, less oversight, another Liberal boondoggle waiting to happen.

Stop cutting education, stop closing schools, and consider following the example of the Ontario NDP “Open Schools” plan, which would create more child care spaces in our underused schools. Close corporate tax loopholes, and conduct a thorough assessment of rolling back the combined corporate tax rate to a competitive level. Stop the current P3s giveaway to wealthy corporations, and focus on a public and transparent procurement process. This province will never recover economically if you continue to waste billions of dollars on P3s.", "The process going forward with infrastructure should allow the Financial Accountability Office to determine the value for money of Ontario’s infrastructure projects.

In fact, Infrastructure Ontario is working with Joseph Brant Hospital, in my riding of Burlington, to develop our new state-of-the-art facility as part of our government’s commitment to infrastructure renewal.", "When the project is complete, it will add 144 single-patient rooms, an increase of 70% in single-patient rooms across the hospital—patient rooms with comforts and conveniences that include three-piece washrooms and many of the comforts of home—and nine new state-of-the-art operating rooms. A new intensive care unit will be built, along with an expanded cancer clinic. All of this is part of our plan to build Ontario up. Why? Because our hospital has not had an investment since 1971. I think all of us would agree that that is long overdue.", "Recent Ontario government investment in local mental health and addictions organizations is also key to building Ontarians up. This will enhance access and care for Burlington residents who are experiencing mental health and addictions challenges. Why do I know this? Because I have many people coming into my office with these kinds of issues, and they’re talking to me about the need to invest in these kinds of programs for their children and their families.", "Our LHIN, the Hamilton Niagara Haldimand Brant Local Health Integration Network, has been provided with $2 million in funding for this year to invest in local and regional high-priority services across the LHIN geography. If you’ll allow me, Speaker, I’m going to elucidate on a few of those.", "LHIN-wide services that will benefit citizens in Burlington include:", "—$81,000 for the LHIN-wide expansion of existing evidence-informed mental health promotion training for families, caregivers and other non-health professionals;", "—$131,000 for the implementation of a LHIN-wide mobile outreach team that will provide early intervention, advocacy and support for youths aged 17 to 24 and their families, as well as improvements in terms of system navigation for those people who need it most;", "—$176,000 to enable capacity-building for concurrent disorders—a huge issue—including funding for a LHIN-wide concurrent disorders project implementation coordinator; and", "—over $3,000 to train health care professionals across the region in areas such as collaborative assessment and management of suicidality—unfortunately a growing issue right across our province.", "The next phase of Ontario’s Comprehensive Mental Health and Addictions Strategy includes a massive $138 million over three years for community agencies to support improvements to mental health and addictions services throughout our LHINs across Ontario.", "Supporting community mental health and addictions as I’ve just outlined is part of Ontario’s Patients First: Action Plan for Health Care. It is also part of our government’s four-part plan to build Ontario up by investing in people’s talents and skills, building new public infrastructure like roads and transit, creating a dynamic and supportive environment where business thrives, and building a secure savings plan so everyone can afford to retire.", "These are a few concrete examples of how the investments made by our government in the last budget are positively impacting the lives of Ontarians in very meaningful ways.", "We’re also committed to strengthening Ontario’s economy and creating jobs. In fact, it was recently announced that we have entered into a partnership with Toyota Canada to expand its Elmira manufacturing facility and create and sustain over 450 jobs.

Linamar, in partnership with our government, is investing over half a billion dollars in their Guelph operations, creating 1,200 new jobs and safeguarding over 6,700 existing positions.", "Just a few weeks ago, closer to home for me, Speaker, Ford announced a $400-million investment in their Oakville facility—great news for our community, for Halton region, and a huge mark of confidence in our province. In fact, virtually every chief economist in Canada, and the Conference Board of Canada to boot, has said that Ontario will lead the country in economic growth this year, and we are the leading province in terms of foreign direct investment as well.", "Honda, in partnership with our government, is investing over $857 million in its Alliston facility.", "Our government has been the most supportive government to the auto sector in Ontario’s history, which underscores our commitment and determination in growing Ontario’s economy and creating good-paying and long-term employment. It speaks to our agenda of building Ontario up and how residents in communities like mine in Burlington will benefit from the tertiary impacts of these critical investments in our economy and, in particular, our manufacturing sector.", "This is in stark contrast to what we would see in this province if the member opposite and her colleagues in the third party had their way. In fact, as we all know, they voted against our budget, which included many of the things they now demand, including an Ontario Retirement Pension Plan which will, among other things, serve to ensure that we do not have a generation of Ontarians retiring in poverty. No one wants that. They talk of the dangers of selling government assets, etc., and they repeatedly bring up our government’s supposed cuts to health care and education, but in their own platform they laid out their plan to reduce spending in these areas by $2.2 billion by 2017-18.", "In short, our government clearly holds the best interests of Ontarians as our number one priority, as my examples have shown. We are dedicated to balancing the budget by 2017-18. That is our plan for the benefit of future generations.

Some of these points we even agree with. For example, we agree that the budget cut health care and continues to fire nurses on a daily basis, reversing a pledge the Premier made to the people of Ontario in the 2014 election. She wasn’t going to fire anybody. We agree that the budget cut education and closed schools, again reversing a pledge the Premier made to the people of Ontario in the 2014 election. And we agree that the budget makes life more expensive for families by letting hydro bills and gas prices rise, again reversing a pledge the Premier made to the people of Ontario in the 2014 election.", "However, the solutions that Progressive Conservatives would propose to address these problems are very different from those of our NDP colleagues to my left. The type of policies the NDP would like to put in place are not ones we would agree with, and therefore we cannot support this motion.", "But given these examples of how the Premier reversed herself just mere weeks after the June election, I’m very concerned with what might be in the Liberals’ upcoming budget. How many more reversals to pledges will there be? And that’s putting it politely, Mr. Speaker. How many more additional burdens will be put on the people of Ontario and on Ontario families? And how many more people will be fired as a result of this government’s policies and the debt they continue to rack up?", "The provincial debt has been rising because of out-of-control government spending. The amount of money that has to be paid in debt-carrying costs is having an impact on services that people need. Interest on the debt is the third-largest expenditure for this government, after health care and education. At $10.6 billion currently, that works out to $29 million each and every day—$29 million each and every day that goes to pay interest and is lost to other expenditures that would benefit people. Servicing the debt currently takes up 9.1% of provincial revenues, and it’s estimated to grow by a further $400 million this year. These figures are clearly astonishing and unacceptable.", "Week after week, we hear examples of firings because the government doesn’t have the money to fund the people needed in important areas of public service: front-line health care and education, to name two big areas—people such as the special-education teachers in Toronto who will be let go, meaning vulnerable children’s education will be affected. Hospital staff at the children’s hospital in Ottawa, CHEO, are losing their jobs because funding for them is no longer available. Just think how many special-education teachers could be funded if this $29 million a day that goes to interest was available to help those children. Just think how many health care staff could be funded, including the 42 nurses in Sudbury who are about to be fired, if this $29 million a day was available.", "This government spends and spends and spends. This spending increases the debt. More money must go to carry the cost of that debt, so money needed for real people to provide real services disappears. The Provincial Auditor, in her last report, indicated that there’s a real problem because of our debt and our debt servicing costs; that important programs are being crowded out, as she put it. It’s the first time that we’ve seen that from a Provincial Auditor, where she’s worried enough to say that you’re not going to have money for health care and education and other important priorities because of your debt and your debt servicing costs. It’s the people of Ontario who suffer. The government needs to get its fiscal house in order and stop making the people of Ontario carry the burden of its overspending and lack of financial control.", "I’ll conclude, Mr. Speaker, by saying that over the next few days the Ontario PC caucus will be raising a number of issues that we think must be key elements in the government’s upcoming budget. On budget day, we’ll be looking at how its contents measure up to the criteria we have set.

Our police chief just cancelled all leave and holidays for our police department in Hamilton, which will involve, I’m sure, lots of overtime.

That’s great, but I know from my days on city council, and I’m sure other members in here know, that costs escalate. They put in a bid, they get the bid, and then halfway through the bid they tell you, “If you don’t give us another $100 million, we’ll go under because I can’t pay my subcontractors; I can’t finish the project.” I don’t know how many times cities got saddled with either not good workmanship because they did it quickly and couldn’t afford to finish it properly, or secondly, they underbid and couldn’t afford to finish it.

These are just some of the things that they don’t take into consideration when they form a budget.", "Let’s talk about contingency funds for the things that may happen as we go along in the next two years.

They have brought in a jet fuel tax which is making it more expensive for any Ontario traveller to travel across this province. They are also bringing a job-killing payroll tax that they’ve masked behind a pension plan which many people will never derive any single benefit from. That is what their next budget will be.", "The history of this government is to say and do anything in order to obtain power, then retain power.

I’ll tell you, part of it was because of the unprecedented attacks of over 20 unions amalgamated together to spend close to $10 million attacking our leader and our party; but secondly, it was difficult because the government said that there was effectively no deficit too big for them, and they could deal with it. They were going to meet all of their deficit reduction targets.", "When my colleague from Niagara West–Glanbrook, the former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, put forward his plan in order to get back to balance, the government of the day, which ran for re-election, effectively said that they wouldn’t do those things. Now, less than a year later—less than nine months later—this government is now on track to reduce or eliminate 100,000 jobs in the public service. Don’t take my word for it; ask the nurses at CHEO; ask the education workers at the Toronto District School Board; ask the PSW workers across this province. Tim Hudak told the truth, and Kathleen Wynne decided she wanted to mask the dirty little details of the debt and the deficit.", "They talked about privatizing hydro as a bad thing, dating back to Dalton McGuinty’s days. The current Minister of Energy over a year ago said that they would never privatize hydro. Yet they decided when they assembled people for a $1,500-per-plate fundraiser that they were going to start to sell off hydro—but they’re not doing it to pare down the size and scope of government; they’re not doing it to eliminate the debt and the deficit; they’re not doing it for the future of Ontarians; they’re doing it so that they can have more spending power. They’re basically selling off the family car in order to buy a big vacation. In their minds, that’s how it works, and to Ontario families I say that’s exactly what’s happening.", "When we look around the province of Ontario today, we are seeing the catastrophic effects of a government that is allowing its debt and its deficit to take control of our situation. My leader, the leader of the official opposition, today stated in this House that the third-largest spending priority of this government is servicing the debt and the deficit. That means every single dollar spent on servicing the debt and the deficit is a dollar taken away from our children in schools and our patients in hospitals. That is the direct correlation. Our leader also said today that this is a government that isn’t concerned with trying to eliminate the debt and the deficit. He indicated today that it’s $29 million a day that is being wasted and diverted away from those kids. I think that is what’s important here.", "When the New Democrats today talk about the cuts to health care and firing nurses, that is a consequence of the government not meeting its deficit reduction targets. When the New Democrats talk about education and school closures, that is a direct response to a high debt and deficit. When they talk about affordable housing being slashed across the province, that is because of the debt and the deficit. The transportation and closing of bus stations across the north: Those are all consequences of a government that doesn’t take its fiscal health seriously.", "Now they’re going to have to adopt the Progressive Conservative platform in 2014, a platform that they didn’t campaign on, that they told us they didn’t believe in, and one that I think they’re only half-heartedly trying to make work. These are the real consequences.", "I’m going to say, Speaker, that the Liberal reality and the Liberal campaign promise are two very different things, and that’s why we’re here today. I can sense the frustration, not only with my own colleagues but those of the New Democratic Party. When we were told one thing by this government and they do another, it’s very frustrating, and we see the direct consequences to that.", "Speaker, I started this—and I’ll end soon—by talking about the views and values of the people I represent in Nepean–Carleton and how proud I am as a member from the city of Ottawa to stand here each and every day for the past nine years.", "One of the people that I’ve drawn a great deal of inspiration and support from recently passed away, and I want to share with you a little bit about Ken Ross. I’ve spoken about him many times in this assembly. Ken was a great community leader from Barrhaven. He owned Ross’s Independent grocery store. Whenever there was an opportunity to speak about the budget or supply or any of those big things that we talk about here at the Legislature, Ken was the first call I made. He was the chair of the business improvement area. He was involved in the Legion in which I’m involved, the Lions Club, the South Nepean Autism Centre; he was a founding director. I was one of the founders as well. He had a great deal of compassion for other people.", "Ken was the exact type of person we want to see succeed in Ontario: a business owner who understands that government can’t and shouldn’t do it all itself. So he would bring people together in order to ensure we had wonderful services in our community. In fact, when he died, he was chairing the Barrhaven Food Cupboard, which I’m also very much involved in. I must say, just in the last hour, to the Barrhaven Legion how proud I am of them for donating $10,000 to that cause, and $5,000 of that in the name of Ken Ross.", "So when I close today, I must say this: Each budget I would speak to Ken, and Ken would give me his straight goods, straight talk on how it would affect businesses, how it would affect service clubs, how it would impact the people that I represent. He’s not with me this year, not with any of us this year, to talk about the Ontario budget and its proposals. So I say this to my constituents: I will continue to talk to them, as I spoke with Ken and many of them previously, and I’ll look forward in the next month, as Progressive Conservatives, New Democrats and Liberals look around this province, look at the real challenges that not only this province faces, but that the people who live here, the people who call Ontario home, face. We bring those to the floor of this assembly and we debate them vigorously. For no idea is a bad one in this assembly; it needs debate. For that, I want to say thanks for the opportunity to speak, thanks to the New Democrats for bringing this idea forward, and hopefully to the Liberals for a spirited debate.

We’re not going to implement, as a government, all of them, because there are some that go beyond what our government thought was fair and reasonable in the circumstances, but where Don Drummond has made a reasoned, sensible plea to optimize and streamline parts of the government, the government has done it, and four out of five of his recommendations have been implemented, with more still to come.", "This speaks to an ability to do something that this motion doesn’t.

Because they didn’t do the job when they should have.", "If they had paid some proper attention to managing Ontario’s debt and deficit in a more timely fashion, we wouldn’t be in the situation we are in today: a $12.5-billion deficit in an economy that should be doing so much better, but it’s not. That is the challenge that this government has. I don’t envy them, but I certainly don’t have sympathy for them because the chickens are coming home to roost and they’re the ones who bred the chickens.", "The debt servicing costs in Ontario are the third-largest item in the budget following the expenditures on health care and education—almost $11 billion. If that number wasn’t there, we’d have $11 billion to spend on the things that Ontarians need and deserve. Certainly, I say “deserve” because the way this government has picked their pockets over the past 12 years and not delivered the services they have asked for—clearly, the people have paid the bill and the government has not delivered. That could be the mantra of this government: “You pay the bills. We’ll fail to deliver.” It could be their slogan because we could repeat that so many times.", "Yet, in the past, they were elected on platforms that really didn’t speak to what the plan was. “I will not raise your taxes.” Do you remember that guy? He stood in front of the television cameras and said, “I will not raise your taxes.” Do you remember who that was?" ],

Then, of course, in 2007, they never said a word about the HST, how they took that tax and put it on so many more items, including gasoline—gasoline, Mr. Speaker, which is so important to the people in my riding of Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, where we have to drive pretty well everywhere. There are no subways. There is very little public transportation. People pay far more than their fair share of gas taxes to begin with, which does not go back to them. Then on top of that, Dalton McGuinty brought in the HST and added that on to gasoline, which hurt people even more.", "Throughout their almost 12 years now, we have seen hydro rates go up and up and up, from a time when we were very competitive and had one of the lower rates across the country at 4.3 cents a kilowatt hour, to now when it’s over 14 cents a kilowatt hour at peak. Speaker, there are so many people in this province who simply can’t afford to pay their hydro bills. They have to make a choice: Are they going to pay their rent, or are they going to pay their electricity bill? Are they going to pay their taxes, or are they going to pay their electricity bill?", "In areas like where I come from, Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, a lot of people built their homes in the 1970s, when everybody was being told, “Go electric. Heat your home electrically. It’s going to be the best bargain out there. It will be the cheapest, the most efficient. You won’t have to worry about building all this duct work. You won’t have a furnace. You won’t have anything that has a fire box in your home.” What happened? Well, then, Dalton McGuinty came along. Now to heat those homes in the wintertime—and we’ve had pretty harsh winters; the last couple of them have been among the harshest in history. The cost of heating those homes for most people—many seniors who are on fixed incomes are paying more for a hydro bill than they’re getting in old age pension.", "Now the government is talking about selling Hydro One. They’re throwing all kinds of trial balloons out there to see which ones are going to float and which ones are going to get pinpricked and bust. They’re not giving us many of the details.", "I’ll tell you one thing they’d better keep in mind. It is the electricity consumer who has paid for Hydro One. It is not the government’s right to simply take that asset and say, “We’re going to build subways with the sale of that asset.” That belongs to the people who paid their hydro bills faithfully all those years and have been taking it on the chin from this government.", "If you’re going to sell that asset, first of all, it has to be thoroughly reviewed by the Financial Accountability Officer. It has to be vetted and reviewed by the Auditor General so that we know, the people know, they’re getting fair value for the asset. The problem is, they want to sell this asset at a fire sale price because they want to make the budget look a little better. They want to make the bottom line look a little better. Somebody out there is going to get a bargain, or at least they’re going to be portrayed as getting a bargain from the government. But the reality is, there are so many liabilities attached to the sale of Hydro One that there may not be as many suitors as they like to think. Before they have a deal, before they sign anything, it better be vetted by those two officers of the Legislature so that the people who have paid for that asset know that the government is selling it for fair value, not at a fire sale price because they’re trying to dig themselves out of the hole that they put themselves in.", "That’s what’s wrong about this government: They want to blame everybody else, including Stephen—oh, don’t get me started on Stephen Harper and the federal government, because every time this government has a problem, they try to pin it on Stephen Harper.", "Stephen Harper has nothing to do with your deficit here. He has nothing to do with your health tax and the mess you’ve made in health care. He has nothing to do with the cuts in education and the mess you’ve made in education. He’s had nothing to do with your broken promises, not one of them. Stephen Harper’s had nothing to do with it, but every time you find yourself in trouble, you try to blame Stephen Harper. You try to blame Stephen Harper because you can’t manage your own affairs. It is about time that this government took responsibility for its own actions.", "I understand why the NDP has brought out this motion.

That is not what they voted for. That is not what they expected. When we heard a so-called progressive Premier stand up through an election and talk about the things that she was going to do for this province, I certainly did not hear that she was going to be cutting nurses, that she was going to be cutting education, that she was going to privatize our hydro or that she was going to start to privatize our LCBO and make changes. Those are the kinds of things that Ontarians want and deserve to know that they’re safe in public hands, and I believe that that, as New Democrats, is what we believe here also.", "I just want to go through a few of the cuts that we have found that the Liberals claim do not exist, but we know very well and clear. I’ll tell you, Speaker: My office is inundated each and every day with casework because of the cuts that this government has put forward—cuts to our WSIB and what that’s doing to workers in this province daily. I have people coming in who have been in the system for quite some time, and now they’re being cut off medication; now they’re being cut off therapies.", "I’m just going to go through some cuts that I found. Let’s start with the ones that are directly in my riding. This morning we heard the Deputy Premier talk about how there are not cuts to schools, and that they were making changes. These are just a portion of my riding. I have an east mountain, a central mountain and a west mountain. This is just the central mountain arc: They closed Eastmount Park. They closed Linden Park. They closed Cardinal Heights. For high schools, they’re closing Barton, Hill Park and Mountain.", "That is just in the centre of my riding. We still have to do the east mountain arc and part of the west mountain. What is this government thinking when it comes to education for our children? These are services that our people in Ontario expect and deserve, and New Democrats are going to stand up every single day in this House and put motions like this forward, to make sure that we’re keeping the Liberals on track.", "Let’s talk about health care and the lack of a cut of nurses—and yet, I had specific nurses from a hospital that’s in my riding, Juravinski, send me a note. It says that “a clinical manager informed the nurses on a particular floor”—she said it but I changed it—“just the other day that we are losing eight full-time RN positions, four on each ward,” so that would be two wards. “The positions will be replaced by eight full-time RPNs. Reason: The budget cannot sustain eight full-time RNs. RPNs are cheaper.”", "Now, this is a government that states that they’re not making cuts. This is a government that states that things aren’t going well in our health care, our education and our hydro, yet we’re seeing full well, very clearly in front of us, and hearing daily from people that it’s unaffordable and that changes are affecting their lives.", "I know I don’t have a lot of time left, Speaker. Let me just find—okay. Here’s another cut, for ODSP. For the Work-Related Benefit, $100 was always allocated to people on ODSP when they worked, and it would help them within their daily lives, whatever it may be: getting to work, uniforms, clothing, personal care, hygiene, child care, transportation—work-related expenses. But now the Ministry of Community and Social Services—that’s very progressive, Speaker—is going to eliminate the Work-Related Benefit as part of their restructuring of OW and ODSP employment benefits, and has said that ongoing work-related expenses will not be covered in its new, restructured Employment-Related Benefit.", "Eliminating the Work-Related Benefit will take approximately $36 million annually out of the pockets of people with disabilities who are on ODSP and are trying to work. Is this the voice of a progressive government? I think not. These are our most vulnerable people, people who have been put into a system at no fault of their own, and yet these are the people that this progressive government has decided to pick on.", "I think that’s about all of my time, Speaker.

It’s really interesting to see the rewriting of history. I remember the NDP platform of last June: nine pages in total. Six pages were blank, and the three pages that remained talked about their cutbacks of $600 million in the province of Ontario. I guess they kind of forgot about that, because there is no question in my mind that last June the NDP, the third party, were Tories in a hurry. They couldn’t wait to be to the right of Mr. Hudak. Mr. Hudak was proposing a cut of 100,000 jobs in the province of Ontario, and then the third party was piggybacking on that to reduce our spending by $600 million.", "But we know the NDP. I was a city councillor in Peterborough, back in 1993. I remember sitting down with my good friends in CUPE in Peterborough. There were tears in their eyes when they heard about the social contract. Mr. Speaker, you remember that. Every collective agreement in the province of Ontario went like that, and that’s what happened then.", "To make things worse, in 1993, they froze the ODSP rates in the province of Ontario. In fact, every poverty analyst in the province of Ontario at that particular time said that when the third party froze the ODSP rates in the province of Ontario, it was the start of the downward spiral of poverty in the province of Ontario. Then, my friends in the opposition, they took over government in 1995, and then they slashed the rates by 21%. We remember those days very well. That was the NDP of last June: Tories in a hurry, and good luck to them. It didn’t work out very well.", "Let’s talk about progressive issues in the province of Ontario. My friends in the third party: The greatest social program in the province of Ontario to reduce child poverty was the Ontario Child Benefit program. It’s now being indexed. The late June Callwood, one of the most articulate spokespeople on the issue of poverty in the province of Ontario—we now have awards in her honour for people who are involved in reducing poverty—said that the Ontario Child Benefit was the most progressive program in four decades in the province of Ontario. You would have thought that the party of Tommy Douglas and David Lewis and Stephen Lewis would be on board to support that. Were they on board to support that? No.", "When we proposed a program to bring in the minimum wage to the province of Ontario, to put in an indexing system in the province of Ontario that was agreed upon by people in the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the people that were involved in poverty reduction in the province of Ontario, you would have thought the party of Michael Cassidy would have supported this.

Those people aren’t returning to the hospital ER, which is their only other alternative if they’re not cared for properly. It enjoys the full support of its staff and patients, who rely on this exemplary program.", "To sum it up in the words of a constituent at a public meeting I went to—we had 400 people come out of the woodwork to try to save this program—“This restorative program should be a dedicated line item (in the budget). It is cost-efficient and enables seniors to return to their own homes. It provides in-house physiotherapy, which CCACs do not. It works on memory issues, which CCACs do not. It supports the family, which CCACs do not. Its staff provide care, changes, dressings, bandages, guidance to family members, and it delivers what it promises ... which CCACs do not.", "“This program should be showcased and duplicated throughout the province. Too often the seniors, who were the backbone of this country, have become the ‘forgotten’ ones as they tend not to be vocal.... As the number of seniors is set to double in the coming years, restorative programs such as this one must be increased, not cancelled.”", "I hope, again, that the government is listening to this, because it truly is a program that works. You would hope that they would actually deploy more of these programs across the province. They’re moving more to care at home, which makes sense. It’s a good way to do it. People want to be in their homes.", "But here’s a program that works. Here’s one that prepares people to transition from the hospital to their homes so they actually can be there longer, and yet they’re not able to find money for this. But do you know what?

Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals went out of their way to try to say that they were different and they were the progressive party, and they were certainly not going to be anything like Tim Hudak. They spent the entire election taking a swipe at Tim Hudak and saying, “Imagine that. You’re going to privatize parts of hydro. We wouldn’t do that.” Then they ran around and said, “Oh, we’re never going to touch the LCBO. Oh, no, we’re not going to touch that either. It’s Tim Hudak who wants to do that.” The best one of all was when they ran around and said, “Oh, my God, Tim Hudak wants to lay off 100,000 workers. We’re opposed to that. We think that’s wrong. You have to vote for us because you know us Liberals and our principles and what we stand for—that we would never do such a thing.”", "Now what do we find? The Liberals are a bunch of Tories in a hurry. They’re outflanking the Conservatives. They should be charged with plagiarism for having stolen what was inside the Tory platform and running with it themselves, now that they’re elected. They’re Tories in a hurry, Speaker. They’re so far right-wing, they’re making the Conservatives look like left-wingers. And the sad part is that they don’t believe it; they think that, in fact, they’re progressive.", "Well, let’s look at what “progressive” is. They’re doing P3s times five. Everything they can do to enhance public-private partnerships they’re doing, to be able to build infrastructure, even though the auditor of Ontario has said we’ve wasted $8 billion of our money doing something that we could have done cheaper if we had done it in-house.", "Why are they doing it? I think it’s for two reasons. One is, they’re ideologically a bunch of right-wingers. That’s the first part. The second thing is, they’re able to off-book those investments, so they don’t show up on the treasury on the year that the budget is actually being drafted. So they off-book the thing, and they say, “Here we are; we can spend a bunch more money.”", "If you look at what they’re doing with the privatization of hydro, if you take a look at what they’re doing with the partial privatization of our beer and wine sales system, it’s pretty darn simple. The problem is they’ve spent the bank dry over the last 12 years, they’ve made all kinds of decisions that have put Ontario in a position to be in a $12-billion deficit, and now they’re saying, “Oh, my God, we have a financial crisis. We need to balance the budget. What do we do now? Well, let’s sell off our assets. If we can sell off our assets, that’s going to allow us to have more money to go back and spend again.” It’s akin, Mr. Speaker, to you having a house and the equity on the house is gone because you’re mortgaged to the hilt; you have no more line of credit; you’ve maxed out all your credit cards; but you would love to have a brand new, wall-to-wall, colour TV that’s going to cost you a couple of thousand bucks; and you say, “How do I raise the money for that? Sell the furniture.” Essentially, that’s what these guys are doing. They’re selling the furniture in order to buy the colour TV. That’s the analogy of what they’re up to.", "I just say, these guys are such a bunch of right-wingers. I look at Kathleen Wynne and I just feel bad for Mr. Hudak, because I think Mr. Hudak is now working with his legal counsel—as the Premier is working with her legal counsel—to figure out how he’s going to put together his lawsuit when it comes to plagiarism that the Liberals have done in trying to do what it is the Conservatives said they would do if they became elected. What is really ironic about that is, none of these guys think that they’re doing anything non-progressive. They believe themselves. They think they’re a bunch of progressives.

But I’d ask you, is there anything more arrogant, that when a government presents a budget, says, “We are going to present that budget word for word, number to number, for the House”—we made that solemn commitment to the people of Ontario. We got elected. We presented the budget to the House, word for word and number for number. We were true to our word: every period, every punctuation mark. We presented that budget without change. To me, Mr. Speaker, there’s a word for that. That’s called integrity. And then there was another chance for the people of Ontario to cast their opinion on this government. It was called the Sudbury by-election. And what happened? They voted again to send the member, Mr. Thibeault, the MPP from Sudbury, to the House. So, Mr. Speaker, when they use the word “arrogance,” which I’ve heard them use now five times today—I kept track; five times they used that word—who, I may ask, is arrogant? Is it the party that does what it says, makes a commitment to the people of Ontario, then word for word, down to the punctuation, passes and does exactly what they committed to in the election, or the people who keep on telling Ontarians they got it wrong? They were wrong in Sudbury; they just didn’t understand the third party. They were wrong in the general election. “Clearly, we didn’t get our message out.”", "They have been the third party for 20-plus years right now. How long is it going to take them to realize that the people of Ontario are right and you’re wrong? It might be suggested to you that it is arrogant to keep on telling 14 million people that they constantly get it wrong, because on this side of the House, we actually think the people of Ontario get it right. Sometimes we lose and sometimes we win, but we don’t tell the people we work for that they constantly get it wrong.", "So why would they actually be voting for us?

It would stand to reason that if somebody did something and they didn’t have the permission to do it and the Premier knew nothing about it, then she should fire these people. I think it would be pretty clear. Or is it the case that in fact the Premier ordered these people to do that? What’s clear on the tapes—and I think it’s the latter—the tape says, “I’m here on behalf of the Premier.” They both spoke about trying to do what the Premier wanted. So, clearly, there had to be some kind of discussion between Mrs. Sorbara and Mr. Lougheed, in some kind of way, with the Premier for them to go and do this, which means that the Premier, in the end, will be in apparent breach of the act, once the OPP is finished the investigation, if they’re able to prove that.", "I put the question back to the parliamentary assistant: Why is it that this government has not done what it should have done, which is to take responsibility for this and say to these two individuals, “Step aside while the investigation is ongoing”? Then, based on the charges laid, if they’re laid or not, and depending on the result of the charges if they’re laid—that they are either permanently gone, or they come back if they’re found to be nothing. To this point, the government has never answered the question as to why it is that they have not taken that position.", "So I ask the parliamentary assistant again: Why is it that Pat Sorbara and Mr. Lougheed are still in the positions that they hold, making decisions on behalf of Ontarians, at a time when they both have been found in contravention of the act and are being investigated by the Ontario Provincial Police?" ],

Mr. Lougheed clearly states that he’s there to do the bidding of the Premier and Mr. Thibeault, to ask Mr. Olivier to step down and even nominate Mr. Thibeault.", "He states very clearly that the Premier wants to talk to Mr. Olivier as well, and he says, “They would like to present to you options in terms of appointments, jobs, whatever....”", "They agree it will be a tough decision for Mr. Olivier to step aside for Mr. Thibeault, and Mr. Lougheed says, “[I]f you take the high road on this, what is your reward?” “[W]hat’s in it for you? … [W]hat do we give to Andrew Olivier?” And he admits he’s already raised the question and the Premier wants to have that conversation. But Mr. Lougheed says that “she doesn’t want to be told to eff off”—and that’s all in the transcript, Speaker.", "For her part, Ms. Sorbara says, “You’ve been asked by the leader and the Premier to make a decision to step aside to allow Glenn to have ... the opportunity uncontested.” She suggests she doesn’t want this conversation to be seen as Mr. Olivier being offered a consolation prize. There is committee work available and “if, for example, you wanted to be an executive of the Ontario Liberal Party” or on a government accessibility committee or a government board—then, Speaker, the discussion rolls around to the possibility of a job working in the constituency office of Mr. Thibeault.", "And Ms. Sorbara says, “Okay so, we talked about that, and I think Glenn would actually be very open to that.” And then she says, “[A]ctually Glenn said that a week or so ago, when we were chatting,” but he didn’t want Mr. Olivier to think being a constituency assistant was a consolation prize either.", "Ms. Sorbara says later: “[W]hether it’s a full time or a part time job in a constit office, whether it is appointments, supports, or commissions, whether it is also going on the exec....”", "Speaker, one last point from these transcripts. You’ll recall that Mr. Lougheed says, right off the top, “[I] come to you on, behalf of the Premier....” He isn’t there on his own initiative. He’s the Premier’s voice at that meeting—the Premier, by the way, who likes to hold herself up as a champion of women’s rights and as someone who encourages women to be more involved by seeking political office. Her voice in Sudbury, Mr. Lougheed, in the course of this recorded conversation, disparages a former mayor of Sudbury, Marianne Matichuk, who, by the way, was about to announce her intention to seek that nomination.", "Mr. Lougheed refers to her as “that woman” and tells Mr. Olivier that she should “just ... get lost.” Well, Speaker, she didn’t get lost. The Premier’s voice in Sudbury, the man who is having this conversation with Mr. Olivier, is saying that she should get lost. Why isn’t the Premier saying to Mr. Lougheed, “You’re the one who should get lost, buddy”?", "Will the real Kathleen please stand up? Kathleen Wynne, stand up for the women in this province who wish to run for public office, stand up for your ministers and tell them to answer questions in question period, and stand up for the truth. That’s all we’re asking.", "Thank you." ],

The current public holiday pay calculation is unfair to both employers and employees. Based on $14 per hour, someone who works two four-hour shifts per week for a total of eight hours per week would receive $56 public holiday pay. However, an employee that also totals eight hours per week but only works one day a week would receive $112 for public holiday pay. Further, the person that works one eight-hour day a week is now entitled to the same public holiday pay as a person who works five full days per week. The drastic increase to public holiday pay financially penalizes employers for hiring part-time employees and reduces hiring and scheduling flexibility. It has and will continue to reduce employment opportunities for those that are either only able to, or want to, work part-time.", "“We, the undersigned, petition the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as follows:", "“That the current 2018 Ontario holiday pay calculation be abolished, and that the prior Ontario holiday pay calculation, as follows, be reinstated: That the calculation for public holiday pay is to be calculated on the amount of an employee’s earnings for the four weeks prior to the public holiday and be divided by 20.”", "It’s signed by a substantial number of my constituents." ],

I guess the prorogation was an attempt to reprogram this government’s agenda, but in actuality, it was a chance, or an opportunity, for this government to try to change the movement of the people of Ontario with regard to how they see this government in its true light, which has been one of mismanagement, debt, deficits and erosion of our health care services. It’s quite unfortunate that the government resorted to this type of plan of action.", "What has definitely been seen over the past few weeks is that the government’s attempt to confuse voters didn’t work. The people of Ontario still see this government for what it is: a government that has tripled our debt over the last 15 years to over $300 billion, with interest payments now eclipsing $12 billion a year. That is $12 billion taken out of health, $12 billion taken out of education, agriculture, natural resources and social services. In fact, this $12 billion puts debt repayment up to about the third-highest payout this government has. We have health care, education and debt—payment on the interest charges on our debt.", "I think it speaks volumes to what has occurred with regard to this government over the last 15 years. In my riding alone, over its tenure, this government has lost over 6,000 well-paying manufacturing jobs. We’ve lost the Ford plant; we’ve lost the Timken plant; we’ve lost Lear seating; and we’ve lost Sterling and all the feeder plants associated with it.", "Unfortunately, what has happened is we’ve had some jobs return to the area but not the jobs that people once had in our area. We now have lower-paying jobs without benefits, often part-time. The main reason is that our province has become uncompetitive. It’s been uncompetitive in its tax structure. It has also become uncompetitive with its energy rates.", "You don’t have to go much further than to look at how high our energy rates have gone over the 15 years with this government. In an attempt to woo voters, they borrowed billions of dollars that the pages will be paying for, and probably the pages’ kids down the road, in order for this government to have the appearance of lowering energy rates prior to an election, only to see them skyrocket down the road. It’s unfortunate that in doing so over the last 15 years the energy rates have been skyrocketing and businesses have left this province. Businesses have left southwestern Ontario. As I said before, those were well-paying jobs, with benefits and pensions, that kept smaller communities running. It kept local communities strong." ],

It’s actually fairly close to the riding of the member from Haldimand–Norfolk. This camp has been running for decades, and part of its fun for the students and the kids who go there in the summer—who have nowhere else to go, really. This is their opportunity to get away from their siblings who didn’t go with them and/or their families and/or the rigours of having to do chores all day, and to go have some fun at camp.", "They have this hill. It’s not man-made; it’s a natural hill. At the bottom is a little area where there’s a bunch of water. I wouldn’t say it’s a pool because it’s not a pool. It’s just an area that holds water. And what they would do is put one of those slip-and-slide mats on the hill and get it wet, and the kids would slide down into the water.", "I went over and checked it out. It’s probably about 15 feet they have to slide. It’s not a steep hill. TSSA had deemed that it needs to be enforced and that it needs, first, an engineer’s technical report, and it’s just in the same class as a roller coaster. First of all, this camp can’t afford to hire an engineer to look at a Slip N Slide on a hill. Unfortunately, TSSA was very adamant that it’s an amusement ride even though it’s what we probably grew up doing every day in our neighbourhood—throw down a Slip N Slide and get it wet and slide down it. They wanted an engineer’s technical drawings on it, and so the camp had to get rid of that fun activity. So there’s one less activity for the kids.", "We’re talking about a summer camp in Elgin county. This isn’t a summer camp up in Algonquin park; it’s not a summer camp you see in other areas where they have the resources to develop a full program. This is a summer camp for kids in the area who can’t get to Algonquin park etc. It’s somewhere for them to get away in the summer and have some fun under Christian values. Unfortunately, part of the entertainment—it wasn’t the whole thing. They have nature trails, nature walks, and they go fishing and there are other things they can do, but part of the fun the kids had was just, on hot days, to get the Slip N Slide going and go into the water. I guess it’s the role of the TSSA to keep the safety in there, but sometimes common sense doesn’t seem to exist in some government agencies.", "My other concern that was raised—and this is where it gets interesting. This is the flip side of that argument. I had a constituent contact me that in one of the attractions in Port Stanley, they had those amusement rides that are maybe about this tall, so about five and a half feet tall, and the kids sit on them.

My daughter used to like to do this one. But unfortunately, there were no safety things on it. One of the warning lights was off and a child broke his leg on it, so they came to me and I contacted TSSA.", "TSSA doesn’t oversee those rides. So we have the TSSA worried about Wet ‘N’ Wild’s piece of plastic on a hill, but an actual miniature amusement ride is not in their purview to worry about. The constituent wasn’t asking for major regulations, but maybe a sign to say, “Watch out,” and maybe if there are warning lights, that they’re actually operational on the machine.", "The third point I’ll raise about the TSSA is really an interesting one, and I guess it speaks to the fact that they have to self-fund themselves to a certain extent, so they’re free, without any repercussions, about what they charge. I have a convenience store gas station in my riding which has mentioned to me that he has to provide technical drawings on the safety of where the gas tanks are and the propane tanks etc. which he has to pay to get drawn up and pay a yearly fee on that. But they asked them for new drawings every single year, even if there haven’t been any changes or modifications made, so he’s forking out close to $700 or $800 a year with regard to these drawings, which haven’t changed year over year. It makes it tough on small business owners—small family business owners, at that; his family has owned that place for decades—and they cannot justify why they have to keep doing that.", "This is on top of the lack of the government dealing with contraband cigarettes in this province. They’ve been hit quite hard on the convenience side of the business. I’m not pro-smoking, but I’m very, very anti-contraband-cigarettes in this province, which has been left ignored for decades.", "The high energy rates that he’s spoken about, which are considerably going through the roof—he has to keep his lights on. He has had to cut back his staff. There are less employment opportunities because he’s got these extra fees this government has been charging, without any accountability on these fees. And we have the hydro rates.", "He has been hit really hard with the minimum wage increase. In fact, I think he has even cut down his staff. Sometimes he’s the only one doing the full-day shift because he just can’t afford to bring in that many folks. It’s unfortunate, because that convenience store is a great starter position for a lot of the kids in the community, because they can walk there to work and are close enough to home. All the parents know the owner and know the business; a lot of the neighbours use it. So it’s quite a good spot for a young person to start out and learn the basics about employment and how to work a job, without the distractions of a cellphone, and having to deal with customer service.", "Those are a few of the issues we’ve had with the TSSA and its lack of accountability. I guess the concern with this bill is the fact that now we’re going to give the TSSA the powers to impose the fines on whatever they wish and when, and to also most likely be the judge and jury to any appeals to this type of system.", "You can always argue a stance for safety to make anything pass, but there is a balance to be made between safety, which we all want, and we also have to understand the costs associated with businesses. If they’re doing something wrong that’s not safe, that’s fine, but don’t sit there and try to make things up in order to justify your position or your job at the expense of small businesses and the freedoms of the people of this province. It’s quite concerning.", "Bill 8 also talks about elevators in this piece of legislation. We did mention about elevators and the debt going up, but in my riding—I guess you can compare it to downtown Toronto; there’s probably more of a cry or a need to ensure that elevators are fixed and repaired in a timely fashion. This is one of the things this bill is trying to achieve. I do know it is such a pain when you want to utilize an elevator and it’s out of order, especially when there are only two and one of them is out of order. In fact, if both go out of order, it’s quite a problem. The places that do have elevators in my riding are usually places that house seniors in our area. The need for an elevator to be used at their convenience is necessary", "But if there is a medical emergency or a fire, our firemen have to get up. I know you’re not supposed to use elevators in a fire, but I think that if you have poor mobility, that’s the first place you’re going to look to. But even in emergencies, getting the paramedics up to the eighth or ninth floor to deal with a medical emergency—it would be really unfortunate if an elevator was out of order for months on end, and we’re hearing that that’s happening.", "This part of the legislation that is putting some timelines and reporting in—I don’t truly know the real reasons why it’s taking so long to get elevator repairs done: whether or not there’s not enough competition in the marketplace in order to drive service of those providers, or if there are parts that are missing, or maybe it’s the error of the owners of the elevators; maybe it’s a combination. Hopefully, this bill is able to deal with that situation.", "Mr. Speaker, I’ve touched on a few of these issues here today. I have many, many more issues that I could add into this piece of legislation, that I could discuss. I look forward to seeing where this piece of legislation goes, and goes to committee.

Elevator accessibility is very important, especially to our vulnerable populations: expecting mothers, seniors and those with disabilities.

Not only did I quickly come to understand the seriousness of this issue, but the more that I read, the more I realized this was something that needed direct and quick action.", "I noticed that one of the main differences between this bill and the previous bill is that the original bill had regulations that outlined how quickly an elevator needed to be fixed. This bill doesn’t do that. Instead, it allows the minister to make those regulations. That’s a big difference from the original bill.", "If the minister imposes a deadline that’s quicker than the original, I think that would be a good thing. My concern with this sort of change is what happens down the line if we get a minister who doesn’t prioritize public safety. That may happen. What do we do if Ontario ends up with a minister who says it’s okay if elevators are fixed within a month or two months? At that point, is there even a point in legislating it? I always like to see regulations in detail in a bill, but unfortunately, in this particular bill, that’s missing.", "I’d like to start off this speech with one fact I discovered when researching this bill. I know a lot of people aren’t listening, but I would like my colleagues to listen to this. I know the Minister of Labour just came in. I know he’ll listen to this, because he’ll be concerned about this as well: 4,461. You hear that number? It’s 4,461. That is the amount of annual calls our firefighters across the province receive when they have to act and release people from broken elevators. To me, that sounds extremely high. It’s an issue that, when I see my firefighters on Saturday night at their volunteer night, I will ask them about. Even worse than that, this is a number that has more than doubled since 2001. As you can see, not only is this something not being addressed; it’s an issue that is actually getting worse.", "Before I go on, I’d like to publicly thank the firefighters across the province for the work that they’ve done across our province.", "Mr. Speaker, I know that some people like to criticize our firefighters—because we’re managing to reduce the amount of house fires. But this is a perfect example of why they’re wrong. There is no limit to the services that firefighters provide in our communities right across the province, in every one of our ridings. Everybody sitting here can always go and thank a firefighter. In fact, I would say the importance of their work has moved away from just fires and now involves far more community safety, including getting into the neighbourhoods. Make no mistake about it: these heroes keep us all safe. They make us feel like we live in good communities where it’s safe to raise our children and our grandchildren. So if you’re on an elevator and it breaks down—I’ll ask my colleagues: How many of you have been on an elevator that broke down? Put your hand up—I’ll see who’s listening. Yes, there’s a few. It’s happened right here, and only a few people are here.", "If one breaks down, you can rest assured that your local firefighters are coming, and you can remain calm until they arrive—as well, sometimes EMS comes, depending on what the call is. That sort of assurance is why these women and men deserve our respect and always deserve our support. I hope that firefighters in my riding know how much I support them. I know I have said it in this House many times, but it’s worth saying again.", "I would like to get back to the number and ask people to think about it. Imagine that you’re going to work. We all do that; we come here. Or maybe you’re going to pick up your child for daycare. You go to get into your elevator and it breaks down with you inside it. I can honestly say that it’s never happened to me, but I certainly wouldn’t want it to, that’s for sure. No matter who you are, it’s an uncomfortable experience. It becomes even worse if the elevator is crowded. Frankly, it becomes a health and safety issue, which I know the Minister of Labour understands. What happens if someone has a panic attack in that elevator or a medical emergency? Now they’re stuck in the elevator and it’s not working. I would like the people at home or the people in this House to think about that happening to them or, even worse, to their parents.", "While I was researching my speaking notes for this speech, I came across a story that is a great example of how bad this could be. She has shared her story with the press, and I would like to share her story here because I think it needs to be heard. This is from a woman named Nancy. I have her last name, but I am not sure if we okayed the last name, so I’m not going to say it without having known for sure.", "She retold her experience with a failing elevator in a public building. It started making a lot of banging noises, and then the lights went out. A lot more banging went on, and then it dropped to the basement. I’m going to repeat that: It then dropped to the basement. It jolted her. When it came to a stop at the bottom—and this is her speaking: “It jolted me when we came to a stop at the bottom. I didn’t know what was happening or when it was going to stop. Everything was black. I kept trying to press buttons to try to make it open the doors but nothing would happen.”", "Can you imagine that happening to any of us, how scared we probably would be? That’s what happened to Nancy. Luckily, she was rescued. I want people here and at home to think about that happening to them. Nancy survived, but she suffered from whiplash and required medical attention.", "Looking at the data, we can see that hundreds of people are getting injured in elevator-related accidents right across the country, not just in the province of Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, I would also like you to think about seniors in this situation. Many of them have to rely on the use of elevators in order to get in and out of their buildings. Before I continue with the seniors—again, I heard some of the comments earlier, but I do want to talk a little bit about seniors and what’s going on in all our communities right across the province of Ontario.", "I’ve had the opportunity over the last little while to meet with churches, with Legions, with Rotary Clubs, with Lions Clubs. Do you know the one ask that’s being asked everywhere I go? Does anybody know? They need an elevator. They need an elevator for their church; they need an elevator for the Legion. One of the highest expenses that they’re going to have in running that volunteer organization or running their church is an elevator.", "But do you know what’s happening in a lot of our churches? I’m sure everybody goes to church on a regular basis. At our churches, the people who are going are getting a little older. They have no way to go to church anymore, because the church doesn’t have an elevator. So I’m going to say to the government—I’ll say it to our government when we become government in June—that we have to make sure that the grants are there to make sure that we get more elevators provided for our churches, our social clubs, our Legions.", "I know the Legions are doing fish fries. I go to my Legion on Friday nights. Probably some of the best fish is at your local Legion, usually, at the end of the day. They’re using that as fundraisers to keep the Legions going. They need lots of volunteers. The one thing they can use some help on from any government, whoever it is—we need to make sure that we have some help for them as we try to get them elevators that are safe, that can work, so they can go to church, they can go to the Legion and they can go to their Rotary clubs and provide an incredible service for all our communities right across the province of Ontario.", "I’ll get back to where I am on my speech. I just wrote that down, because I thought it was important to get that out, as I meet churches right across my riding.", "I also like to think about the seniors in this situation. Many of them have to rely on the use of elevators in order to get in and out of the building. What are they supposed to do if the elevator breaks down and they’re stuck?", "I would like to briefly discuss a story that came through our constituency office. A lady who suffers from mobility issues faced an elevator breakdown in her apartment complex. We don’t have a lot of high-rises in Niagara Falls; we have some. We obviously have some high-rises in the tourist sector, with our hotels.", "I know that down in my communities of Niagara Falls, Fort Erie and Niagara-on-the-Lake, there are not nearly as many people living in apartment buildings as, let’s say, in Toronto and some of the bigger places—Ottawa, Montreal. But we definitely still suffer from this problem when elevators are out of service for an extended period of time.", "She lived in a building in Niagara Falls; she lived on the third floor. This is where the story gets extremely interesting. I know that my colleagues are listening, because it could happen in their riding at any time.", "This individual came to our constituency office and informed us that the landlord had posted a note on the front of the elevator door that said the elevator was going to be down for four weeks for repairs—four weeks.", "Here you have a lady from Niagara Falls who has accessibility issues. She can’t walk up the stairs, can’t get to her apartment. She quickly got in contact with her landlord and asked how people who suffer from mobility issues would be accommodated for the four-week period that the elevator was going to be out of service. Unfortunately, the landlord had little answer for her. The landlord told her that there were no main-level apartments available for her to stay in during the time that the elevator was going down. The only option that the landlord would give her—listen to this—was to provide her with someone to get her groceries and bring them up the stairs while she’d be forced to stay in her apartment for four weeks. Think about that.", "This unfortunate response from the landlord prompted her to visit our constituency office to discuss her current problem. She came into our office and spoke with one of our constituency assistants about the fact that she was going to be forced to stay inside her apartment for four weeks straight, simply because the landlord could not get the elevator fixed in her building. I ask anybody that’s here this afternoon: Would you want that for yourself, your mom, your grandmother, your grandfather? I don’t think anybody would. So when you hear, “I don’t know if anybody is talking about the elevator bill,” there are absolutely a lot more things that are probably more important than an elevator bill, but don’t underestimate what we’re going through in the province of Ontario on these issues, particularly with seniors.", "My staff were shocked when they heard this. How could an elevator take four weeks to be repaired, and how could there be no options from the landlord for residents who have mobility issues? Frankly, it was so shocking that my staff called me directly at Queen’s Park to discuss the case and bring the issue to my attention. I could not believe what I was hearing.", "The first step that our office took once I heard about this individual’s situation was to contact the landlord directly so we could discuss the situation and make sure that there were no other options for the individual during this period of time. After speaking with the landlord, it was clear that they were frustrated with the timeline of the repair, but they said their hands were tied. The company that was there to fix the elevator set out the timeline, and four weeks was the quickest turnaround for this particular issue—four weeks. It was nearly a full replacement of the elevator, and some repairs needed to be made on the shaft.", "We completely understand that this type of work can take time, but to leave residents in that building with mobility issues no option but to sit there in their apartment for four weeks is completely unacceptable to myself and, I believe, unacceptable to everybody that’s here. It doesn’t matter what party you’re with—PC, NDP or Liberal—it’s unacceptable.", "Once our team in the constituency office realized that the information from the constituent was correct and there was no other solution from the landlord, we took action to find appropriate housing for the constituent. If you live in Niagara, probably like right across the province of Ontario, finding housing is extremely challenging, to say the least. Our team worked with caseworkers at a local social assistance office, and they were incredibly helpful in looking at possible solutions to cover the temporary housing while work was being completed in the apartment building. Unfortunately, while our office was working on securing the potential funding for temporary housing, the constituent went back to her apartment, and the elevator had been taken out of service already and the repairs had begun. She was completely unable to get up the stairs and had nowhere to sleep that night.", "I’m going to read that again. I’m hoping everybody is listening to this, because this could be our moms; it could be our grandparents. Quite frankly, it could be us. She was completely unable to get up the stairs and had nowhere to sleep that night. Fortunately, she was able to find a friend who could temporarily house her, but what if she didn’t get hold of a friend? She would have been completely stranded.", "Fortunately, I’ll say this for all constituency workers: They do incredible work, and my constituency office is no different. My team worked to find a solution. We were able to work with the local social assistance agency to find emergency housing funds to cover the costs of a temporary housing situation for the constituent. She unfortunately had to live in a motel for a period of time, but at least it was accessible to her. They were able to reach out to the constituent to review her situation and determine if there were any laws the landlord was not following.", "Once the funding was secure, she was able to ensure that she had accessible housing she could rely on, but it was not ideal and it was not home. The whole situation was really unfortunate, but we were happy that we could help. However, having her stay in a motel for a long period of time was not a solution to the problem. It was completely unacceptable that she had to endure this.", "No one in this province who has mobility issues should have to face such a situation, but unfortunately, a lot of people in this province do face this problem. We were happy that we could assist the individual who came to our office, but we know she wasn’t the only one in the building with mobility issues. We know that when this happens to people right across the province, many of them don’t reach out for support and most likely suffer during that period that the elevator is down.", "I think it’s important for us to sit back and reflect on what has happened to this particular individual who came into my office. She was torn away from her home for four weeks. She was left homeless for one evening. I’ll repeat that. She did nothing wrong here. This is an individual who lived in an apartment, had accessibility issues, did nothing wrong; she paid her rent, lived in the apartment and was put in a position where she was homeless for one night. I don’t know how many in this room have been homeless for one night. But she certainly didn’t deserve that.", "She had to live in a motel for four weeks and seek out assistance from friends, something that typically—we can all agree with this, I think—can sometimes be very embarrassing. Think about the secondary problems that one faces when they’re out of their home for that period of time.", "I didn’t know this until I investigated this and looked into this further: At her motel, there was no kitchen to cook meals. That meant that this individual, who is already living on social assistance, had to pay for her pre-made food every day for four weeks. As we all know—I know a lot of us here probably eat out once in a while—that can be incredibly expensive.", "Also, just think about the comfort of home that was stripped away from her while she was out of her home.

This happened only because she had mobility issues.

This isn’t the first time that someone in our community faced such a problem. I know it’s not the first time that someone in this province has faced such a problem. I hope this legislation can help to prevent people from having to face such harsh realities.", "I think that, sometimes, the people without mobility issues take for granted the ease of access we have in our society. If this was to happen to myself, I could just take the stairs. It might be slightly inconvenient, but I can do it.

But what if you just refer to the fact that people can’t use their own elevators? Imagine you’re a senior, and maybe you have mobility issues, and now you’re stuck on the ninth or 10th floor of your building. I can tell you that when I stay in Toronto, I’m on the 20th floor. It’s quite a ways up. This could be a serious health and safety issue. How are you supposed to go up and down nine to 10 flights of stairs to get your groceries or get to a doctor’s appointment?", "I’ve talked about seniors in this House many, many times. They deserve to live in dignity and with respect. That means that they deserve the right to be able to live in their homes for as long as they want and as long as they’re able. As a government, you should be doing everything you can to ensure they have that ability.", "Obviously, you want to make sure that long-term care is available if they need it. That’s an issue for another day: long-term care. I don’t want to get off the elevators and the bill itself, but obviously, long-term care is a huge issue in my riding and, I think, right across the province. Mr. Speaker, I think you would agree with that. Even in your area, it’s probably a big issue, long-term care.", "We need to make sure that they have no barriers to living on their own if they wish. So when we look at an issue of accessibility, it absolutely needs to be addressed. What if a senior reads about these elevator issues and they decide they can’t live in an apartment building because they’re too worried about the elevator? That’s another barrier they face, and it’s a barrier that doesn’t need to be there. Our seniors deserve everything we can give them, and this is obviously an issue that affects them, so I support taking these actions.", "Mr. Speaker, I can’t overstate how important this issue is. I’d like to read some information that the Canadian Press released. This is a quote from Rob Isabelle, who is a mechanical engineer and someone who acts as a consultant to property managers. Here’s what he had to say: “I don’t think we’re heading toward a crisis, I believe we’re already there....", "“If we look at the reliability of a large number of pieces of equipment, it’s really the worst it’s ever been.”", "Why isn’t that being addressed? And the question becomes—I ask all my colleagues—why is it getting worse? Because the reality is, it should be getting better. We’re building more apartment buildings, more condos. All those things should certainly lead in a direction that they’re going to get better.", "Mr. Speaker, it turns out that there is more to this story. Here in Canada, most of our elevator services are owned and run by four major companies, which are engaging in a race to the bottom. I’m going to repeat that, because I think the Liberals should hear this one: Here in Canada, most of our elevator services are owned and run by four major companies, which are engaging in a race to the bottom. In this case, it seems clear to me that these companies are sacrificing public safety in order to make a few bucks.", "Because they’re the largest companies, they undersell any competition, and people have few other choices. Some 20 years ago, technicians would be hired and they would oversee somewhere around 35 to 45 elevators a month, for around $1,000 per elevator. That was 20 years ago. Listen to this; this is really what the problem is. This is kind of where you’ve got to say, “Why?” Today, the same contract is worth about half of that, but the technicians are now responsible for over 100 elevators. Does that make sense to anybody? It certainly doesn’t to me. They simply are being overworked, and the result is that our elevators are underserviced.", "I’m going to read that again, because this is really what we should be concentrating on as we go through this bill. If we’re actually looking for fixes, this is the part we should be really concentrating on: They simply are being overworked, and the result is that our elevators are underserviced.", "To make matters worse, these elevators are getting old, so they’re working on old equipment and sometimes trying to replace parts that might not even exist anymore.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m going to try to include you. I know it’s lonely up at the top there every afternoon, so this is for you: I’m sure you’ve ridden the elevator here at Queen’s Park. If you read the inside, it says that our elevators include the 14th elevator built in this province. Our team here at Queen’s Park does an incredible job. In fact, every employee who works here goes above and beyond to do a stellar job.

It’s really a simple fix.", "My point here is, these elevators are getting old, and as they get older, they’re more likely to need servicing, and yet we see the contracts going in the opposite direction. I’m hoping everybody understands what I’m trying to say there. You know they’re going to break down, so why do we have less service technicians taking care of more elevators, knowing full well that the repairs are going to be bigger and more complex? In the bill, we should be looking at that. The Liberal government that brought the bill forward should be looking at that.", "And what you could do—and I have no problem with it—is check and make sure the facts are straight. Make sure that what I’m saying here is exactly what’s going on in this industry, and why these four companies are getting away with it. Why are these four companies being able to get rid of the competition and then do whatever they want, and then if the elevator is down for four weeks, they say, “We don’t care. It’s not a big deal to us”? But we should care. Everybody here should care. Everybody should care and make sure that if the elevators are breaking down in our communities—and I’ll tell you where you should probably care more than anywhere. Does anybody know? I hope some people are paying attention. Does anybody know where we should care about this more than anywhere? Right here in Toronto. Who has the most elevator use in the province of Ontario? It’s not Niagara Falls. We have some, with our hotels. But go walk down around Yonge Street with all those condos that are there and the elevators up and down, where they have five and six elevators in some of these locations. So who should care to find out that they’re not servicing those elevators properly? It should be the MPPs from Toronto. They should be saying it’s unacceptable that these companies are not hiring enough technicians to take care of your elevators and are forcing people not to get service and having them sit there for hours, or having them break down, like the lady I talked about earlier, about 20 minutes ago, in my speech. I talked about when she was on the elevator.", "I’m going to ask anybody—I want my colleagues in the PC Party to hear this too—how would you like it if you’re on an elevator, all the lights go out and the elevator starts falling?

Make sure the pulleys and everything are being checked and make sure it’s not going to break down. That way, that elevator won’t drop six or seven floors with one of us in it. I’m telling you, I’ve only seen it on TV. It does not look like it’s fun. Pretty scary stuff. We can fix it. Collectively, we can fix it. We can fix it by going after these four companies and saying, “You hire the right number of technicians to do the job.”", "I got a little bit off my script there. I hope that’s okay. I included you in my little speech. I hope you liked that. But that’s what the issue is.", "I’ll continue. It’s all to an issue about getting parts. I’ve seen a lot of elevator technicians say that the parts that they need for the old elevators just don’t exist. Obviously, it’s difficult and it requires skilled labour to fix it; I think we can all agree there. It’s unfortunate that in many cases, landlords just don’t want to bring in the right skilled trade labour to address the situation. This isn’t always their fault. The major companies—again, the four companies that are controlling this industry—offer much cheaper products, and sometimes landlords just have no choice when it comes to the market.

The more we can make this known, the more pressure we can put on these companies to do their job properly.", "Mr. Speaker, the issue goes beyond health and safety as well. It’s also an issue of jobs. I know the members of the International Union of Elevator Constructors have spoken out about what these companies are doing. This isn’t the first time this has been raised. It’s been raised by their union. So I’m sure somebody in the government, probably the labour minister, has heard from the unions about this issue. They have spoken about what they are seeing in the elevator industry now. They keep cutting corners and they keep cutting service. Sound familiar to anybody? By the time the work ends up with someone on the ground here in Ontario, there is no way they can keep up.

That’s the problem, and this bill has got to do more work on that.", "Mr. Speaker, this is why we get upset that corporate taxes are lower than they have been in decades. This is why we get upset when major corporations don’t pay their fair share like the rest of us in this province. Do these companies sound like they deserve a break? Let me know. I’m listening. Do they? When people get injured in their faulty elevators, we’re the ones that have to pay for their medical bills, while these companies continue to rake in higher profits and pay less tax.", "Why are people getting injured? I think it’s been clear over my presentation, and I’m prepared to find out, if somebody looks it up, that I am not completely right—I have no problem. You can correct me. The issue is clear to me: We have the technicians, we have the skill, but we have companies that aren’t providing the service. That’s what’s going on here. Hire more technicians, force these companies to do their jobs and make our elevators safe for me, for you, for our grandparents, for our kids and for our grandkids. We can do this.", "When people get injured in faulty elevators, we’re the ones—as I just said—who pay their medical bills, while these companies continue to rake in higher profits and pay less taxes. They need to fix their issues, and I believe they should be contributing more to our communities. The focus should not be on rewarding these companies, but holding them to account in favour of our residents and our constituents. Again, I can’t stress enough that this should be a major, major focus across the province of Ontario, but certainly right here in Toronto.", "Mr. Speaker, as you can imagine, my riding doesn’t have as many tall buildings as a Toronto riding, but we absolutely still have them. We still have lots of seniors, like they do in Toronto, although I’ll tell you, Toronto, a lot of your seniors are moving to Niagara. I’m sure you’re aware of that. They’re coming down to my riding, to Niagara-on-the-Lake and Fort Erie, to Ridgeway, Crystal Beach and Chippawa. It’s a beautiful place to come. I understand why they’re coming down to Niagara; it’s beautiful. But I’m hearing they’re coming down because you guys won’t fix their elevators. That’s really one of the reasons why they’re coming.", "We still have lots of seniors and residents who live on top of numerous flights of stairs. The other thing we have lots of in Niagara is hotels. I haven’t touched a lot on hotels, but we have some high-rise hotels. Some are 60, 65 or 70 floors. Hotels have dozens and dozens of storeys. As this bill goes through the process, I plan to reach out to these hotels and see where they are with this issue. I know the firefighters have been called to the hotels a number of times for people stuck in the elevators. Actually, there was a big case last summer, during the height of tourism season, where they were stuck there for quite a while.", "I can guarantee you this: If it happens in an apartment building, then it’s probably happening in hotels, especially some of the smaller hotels, because some of the smaller hotels are older. I’m worried to think about what would happen to someone’s family vacation if they saved up enough money to come to Niagara Falls, maybe bringing their elderly parent or their young children. I will tell you that we’re seeing some people from all over the world, and what I see with people from all over the world, maybe a little different than us, is that they do bring their parents. A lot of them do have their parents come with them and celebrate Niagara Falls.", "I will say—I know it’s a little off the bill—that I think that’s why you’re seeing more and more parents come with them to Niagara Falls. You can go anywhere in the world and say “Richmond Hill” or whatever and they would have no idea where it is, but if you say “Niagara Falls,” everybody in the world has heard of Niagara Falls. I think that’s why you see a lot of the elderly parents also coming to Niagara Falls.", "Imagine that once they get there, they find out that the elevator is broken and they’ve got to walk up and down dozens of flights of stairs. I know that this seems smaller than the health and safety issue, but this is still a serious concern. In the world of tourism, bad reviews can be the difference-maker between successful businesses and the one that doesn’t make it. I know the local operators strive to do everything they can to provide the best experience in the world for people, so I plan to speak with the local hotels and see if they run into this issue and how often.", "The more I read about these elevator companies, I expect this will be a problem. They seem to care more about making money—I’ve said that before, earlier in this speech—than making sure that someone’s business succeeds, so that’s an issue that can be expected to be raised as well.", "I’d like to touch on another aspect of this debate that’s very important to me. It’s an issue that I tried to raise when we were talking about anti-scalping regulations, because it affects so many things. We just heard about the Blue Jays, and how they were actually working with the scalpers at StubHub. Imagine that. I don’t have all the details there, but they were working with StubHub, which was surprising to me. I’m a big Blue Jays fan, and I was surprised that they would do that.", "The issue of making sure that our buildings are accessible: Far too often in this place, the issue is that those with mobility issues are completely forgotten, including right here in Queen’s Park. I felt that was the case with the anti-scalping legislation, which made no real effort to ensure the accessibility spots at concerts were also reserved so that residents could fairly get them. On this issue, I didn’t want to leave it out.", "I’ll ask anybody here, do you think it’s fair and reasonable to have spots put away for people with mobility issues so they can go to concerts, a ballgame or a hockey game? I think that’s being fair, I think it’s being reasonable and I don’t think anybody here should argue that issue.", "As we see more and more seniors are living longer—I can tell you, when my father-in-law was alive, one of the best events we went to was a Blue Jays game once or twice a year. In later years in life, when he had some mobility issues, he didn’t go to the games. Some of it was the fact that we couldn’t get him a spot. So I think it’s fair to ask that we fix that issue so everybody can enjoy sports in the province of Ontario.", "What does a person with mobility issues do if the elevator in their apartment goes out? I would like to know someone’s answer on that. Are you supposed to starve? I know it sounds harsh, but I’m asking. Some people don’t have family. Quite frankly, as you’re older, sometimes you don’t have any friends. I’m not being mean on that; a lot of times, a lot of our friends pass before us, and you’re like the last one standing, unfortunately. I saw one of my buddies yesterday, and we were talking about how many guys have passed away from the plant, as we all get older.", "What if you’re on fixed income? I think if you ask those questions, you’ll see the importance of solving this issue and ensuring that when an elevator breaks, it’s quickly repaired or that it’s safe in the first place. I like that line. I’m going to read it again: that when an elevator breaks, it’s quickly repaired—I think that’s fair, I think that’s reasonable and, quite frankly, I think it’s a necessity—or that it’s safe in the first place.", "When you read that—and I ask my colleagues from the PC Party about that—what’s the best way to keep the elevator working and not breaking down as much? Preventive maintenance and making sure they’re regularly checked—just saying.", "Far too often in the province of Ontario, those living with mobility issues and disabilities are left behind—left out and left behind. Yes, there are regulations in place, but we know how slow the enforcement of those regulations can be and how much harder we need to work to make sure those regulations are enforced.", "Do those with disabilities not deserve the same dignity as everyone else in the province? Do they not have the right to access the same services as the rest of the us? I know this is an issue the minister is passionate about, and I know it’s something the minister would agree with me on. Residents with disabilities are still residents of Ontario. They are still Canadians. They still pay taxes and, boy, do they contribute. So it breaks my heart to think that someone will be trapped in their apartment if their elevator broke.", "When I look at this bill, I see it puts mandatory timelines on fixing elevators. I can support that for the reasons I stated above. I can support that so that seniors and those with disabilities in this province can live the life they’re entitled to. In fact, if those working in this industry felt the timeline could be moved up, I could support that as well.", "As I’ve tried to explain during this speech, this is more than an issue of convenience. It’s an issue of dignity, of living standards and of health and safety. So if we can do more, I hope that we do.", "I appreciate the time that the minister has taken to bring this bill forward and to raise these issues in this chamber. I would also encourage the minister to speak directly with the Premier. I would encourage her to explain what these companies are doing and to act immediately to make sure these companies aren’t cutting corners and are providing a service and support that residents and landlords can rely on. I would encourage them to do that, not just for the reason I stated but because it’s the right thing to do.", "I briefly touched on the penalties that are listed here. As much as I agree that these companies should be blacklisted and be held to account for these shortfalls, I hope it won’t end there. I hope there’s a plan for a proper regime to recognize and address these problems quickly. The last thing I want to see is for this bill to pass and then there’s no real way to police these issues.", "The last time the previous member introduced this bill, there were certainly discussions around timelines. Reading this bill, those timelines are gone now, but it provides the minister with the ability to set those timelines, which is good as long as they are good timelines. It’s important enough that it deserves to be taken seriously and respected.", "I hope the member will continue to talk with our party and the opposition, as well as stakeholders, to make this bill as strong as possible. But, in the end, I do thank the member for making this issue public, and I’m happy to work with him to do what’s right here and to ensure there is no longer a problem in the province of Ontario. I believe we owe it to everybody living in an apartment today to make sure that when they get on the elevator, they’re going to be safe and they know they’re going to get to the floor that they need to go to.", "Having said that, my hour is just about up.

He knows that when you buy a car, Speaker—and I know you get cars on a regular basis—when you get a car, a brand new car particularly, to service the warranty you need to get it serviced on a regular basis: change the oil and do the things that you need to do. It should be like that with elevators. Typically, when they first go in, you get that preventive maintenance schedule to make sure they’re up and running. When they get older, we need to have mechanisms in place that will ensure that elevators in buildings do have that kind of repetitive and preventive maintenance in place.", "What I did note in his comments to us today is that he talked about, in a sense, that this is an opportunity for hiring more skilled people. It reinforces the fact, Speaker, that these are good jobs. These are skilled trade positions. In Ontario right now, which is doing so well with our economic system clicking along, where we had the lowest unemployment rate that we’ve had in a couple of decades, at 5.5%, it’s hard to find those people.

As he highlighted in his remarks, sometimes it’s next to impossible to get the parts on time, to get them there and to get them in.", "We’ve worked through our office as well—I’m sure all the members have in the past, at some time or another, had constituents who live in those buildings approach them. We’ve arranged meetings between the owners—because lots of times the manager of the building isn’t necessarily in town, in my riding anyway; it might be different in Toronto. But we’re able to get those two parties together and come up with some kind of commitment.", "I know a building in Petrolia. It’s a three-floor building, not 20 or 30 floors. They were making major repairs to the elevator in that building. It was a capital project. The building board of directors—I know them all personally, a number of them—made arrangements. They hired people to actually come and carry groceries and things like that upstairs for the tenants. They were mobile enough they could go shopping, but carrying groceries upstairs would have been impossible. So a number of employers and entities like that can make those types of arrangements. I was proud to work through my office to help make those arrangements.", "I look forward to the rest of the debate. I think it’s something that’s long called for." ],

In my condo building where I lived for a number of years in Welland, we had preventive maintenance a couple of times a year. The elevator guy was there and doing what he needed to do, and we were really never stuck without an elevator. But in my condo here in Toronto, on Balmuto, a 40-storey building, the elevator was out the entire summer a couple of years ago. As you know, some of the elevators go to certain floors and other floors, and there were many people who had to run up and down as many as 40 floors because of the wait times.", "He also raised the issue of seniors being stuck in apartment buildings, and it brought back to me a couple who lived in a building in Welland. The husband was very, very ill, and there was an apartment available on the ground floor. It was a rent-controlled building, so this kind of goes to the housing piece. The landlord would not let this couple move into that ground-floor apartment without increasing the rent by a couple of hundred dollars a month because of the whole vacancy decontrol issue so they could actually get big rent there, and if the people moved out, they could get bigger rent in their place. At the end of the day, they too went into a hotel for a number of days, perhaps weeks, because of his illness so that they would have ready access to ambulances and to health care." ],

Well, it stays in business because you’re putting in information, and that means that you become the product.", "Among the things that the bill does is to ensure that credit reporting agencies give consumers greater electronic access—by the way, free of charge; they must provide this free at least twice a year—that allows consumers to see their own credit history, which would include any credit history reports, any scores and anything that was shared with potential creditors over the last 12 months. This should be an act of due diligence for people at least once or twice a year, to have a look and see: “What does the rest of the world know about what this agency perceives as my creditworthiness?”", "Again, it gives the consumer some option of putting in place a security freeze that would prevent agencies from disclosing credit information to a third party, perhaps information that they would like to dispute.", "With that, I thank the member for his time and hope I’ve added something." ],

If passed, this legislation will impact Ontarians on a daily basis. It consists of two components: elevator availability, and consumer credit reporting.", "Our government is committed to consumer protection and giving every Ontarian access to their credit information, as well as to elevators, particularly for those with mobility issues. My remarks will touch on both of these pieces.", "The proposed amendments to the Technical Standards and Safety Act would establish a legislative and regulatory framework for elevator availability. Out-of-service elevators are a frustration for residents, particularly vulnerable populations, expecting mothers and those with disabilities.", "As part of the action plan, we intend to develop an elevator repair timeline standard, making Ontario the first jurisdiction worldwide to do so. In order to develop the standard, we need to collect more data and fully assess potential costs and impacts. There is a lack of published data on elevator availability not just here in Ontario, but in every jurisdiction.", "If the bill is passed, it would amend the Technical Standards and Safety Act, 2000, in order to create regulation-making authority to:", "—collect elevator outage data;", "—ensure information about elevator performance is published so that prospective residents can make better-informed decisions before they rent or buy a home in a multi-storey building;", "—implement administrative monetary penalties in order to strengthen TSSA’s enforcement of elevator safety and maintenance requirements;", "—create future standards for elevator repair timelines; and", "—designate an appropriate regulator to enforce those standards.", "This is an unprecedented step that will enable our government to make evidence-based decisions when dealing with the issue of elevator availability. This will also allow those living with mobility challenges, elderly people, expecting mothers, those with young children and other vulnerable populations to make better-informed decisions about where they choose to live.", "For those populations, the loss of elevator service can be devastating. We often hear stories of those with disabilities and those with mobility challenges becoming prisoners in their own homes due to elevator breakdowns and slow repair times. Many are forced to incur unforeseen costs associated with locating and paying for alternative accommodation in the event of elevators ceasing to function. For many with health issues, the lack of elevator availability can represent a significant health and safety risk.", "With the growing number of multi-level residential buildings being built in the province, this is a problem that needs to be addressed. As the minister mentioned the other day, so many of our high-rise residences have 40 and sometimes 50-plus floors. Climbing 50 flights of stairs is not an accessible or a reasonable ask for Ontarians to do. People should not have to worry about how to get to their homes from their lobby. This should be a quick and easy process.", "In March 2017, MPP Dong introduced private member’s Bill 109, the Reliable Elevators Act. MPP Dong’s bill received second reading and was referred to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Private Bills. It is for this reason that our government requested the Technical Standards and Safety Authority, or TSSA, to study the state of elevator availability in Ontario and come up with solutions.", "The TSSA, in turn, commissioned an independent study, which was led by the Honourable John Douglas Cunningham, to develop a report identifying key challenges and proposing solutions. Justice Cunningham’s report outlined 19 recommendations aimed at improving elevator availability. We are planning to take action on all 19 recommendations outlined in the report.", "Many of the main points of MPP Dong’s bill, Bill 109, are addressed in this bill. I would like to thank MPP Dong for his work in making elevator availability an issue on Ontarians’ radar.", "This bill is also targeted at improving availability of elevators in multi-storey residential buildings and long-term-care and retirement homes across Ontario. This would subsequently improve the lives of those living in multi-storey residential buildings, particularly those with mobility issues.", "In addition to this proposed bill, our elevator availability action plan would help elevator owners to negotiate better maintenance contracts through an education and outreach campaign, improve elevator access for our first responders in case of emergencies, create new standards for new buildings to ensure they have enough elevators to serve residents, and address the labour supply of elevator mechanics through consultations to determine options to meet labour market demands.", "We’ve heard loud and clear that elevator availability is an important and complex issue, with no single solution. We are committed to collect the data and fully assess the costs required to develop an elevator timeline repair standard. We need to make sure we do this right.", "We’re also working to reduce elevator breakdowns by developing new preventive maintenance requirements and expanding enforcement tools. This is significant when you consider that in Ontario, there are almost 20,000 passenger elevators across more than 10,000 residential buildings, long-term-care and retirement homes. We intend for TSSA to begin collecting elevator outage data in early 2019, should legislative amendments pass and associated regulations be made. The TSSA would also have the authority to issue administrative monetary penalties, starting that same year.", "On that note, I’d like to take a minute to acknowledge MPP Potts and MPP Dong, who had private members’ bills on consumer reporting and elevator availability, respectively. These two champions of consumer rights are joined by MPP Yvan Baker in continuously challenging this government to never wane in terms of consumer protections. This bill is drafted in response to their private members’ bills, and their work on these files should be commended.", "I would also like to note this government’s willingness to listen to its caucus and to the concerns that we have collectively raised on behalf of our constituents. The government and this Premier are clearly willing to listen and are listening to concerns from across the province, and I want to thank them for that.", "I would like now to touch on the consumer credit reporting history.", "Our government is focused on building a fair, safe and informed marketplace for Ontario consumers. If passed, this legislation would be added to an already impressive list of actions taken by this government to ensure that Ontario’s consumers are being protected. Last year, we passed Bill 59, the Putting Consumers First Act, which introduced vital consumer protections in the areas of home inspections, door-to-door sales and payday lenders. We also passed Bill 166, the Strengthening Protection for Ontario Consumers Act, which protects consumers when they travel, when they purchase tickets to a concert or a sporting event, and when they purchase a home or have a new home constructed.", "Unfortunately, the opposition decided that protecting Ontario’s consumers was not a priority for them, and chose to vote against these measures.", "Right now, there isn’t a level playing field when it comes to consumer reporting agencies’ handling of personal data. Ontarians were not being given adequate access to their information, or the ability to ensure that their information was being protected.", "If passed by the Legislature, this legislation will provide stronger consumer protection tools by giving consumers easier access to their own credit information. This bill will, if passed, give consumers greater electronic access, free of charge, twice a year, to their own credit history, including any credit history reports and scores that were shared with potential creditors over the past 12 months. The bill would also give consumers the option of putting in place a security freeze that would prevent agencies from disclosing their credit information to a third party. The changes would give consumers more access and control over their own information and may help reduce the harm of identity theft.", "Mr. Speaker, times are changing. More and more services are accessible online, and it is increasingly the means by which most Ontarians prefer to receive their services. That is why, if passed, this legislation would enable those who choose to view their credit report online to do so. Again, they can view their report online for free.", "If passed, we will consult with consumer reporting agencies as well as businesses that use the services of these agencies, to inform the development of regulations needed to implement the legislative changes to develop without incurring unintended consequences.", "Our proposed amendments would create three major changes.", "When requested by a consumer, a credit reporting agency would have to provide consumers with their credit history and credit score electronically at least twice a year. They would not be allowed to charge a fee for this.", "The agencies would have to provide, as part of a consumer’s report, any scores given to third parties within the past 12 months. This will help a consumer to understand the information an agency has provided to a creditor.", "Agencies would also have to give consumers the option to put in place, suspend or cancel a security freeze that would prevent agencies from disclosing information.", "I should also note that my colleague the MPP from Beaches–East York, Arthur Potts, proposed many of these changes in his private member’s bill last fall.", "If passed, Ontario would have the strongest and most transparent rules in Canada over how consumer reporting agencies share your credit information.", "We understand that this bill would mean changes to the way consumer reporting agencies operate. They are not decisions we’ve made lightly. We know that the information shared by these agencies trickles down to all sectors of the economy.", "In particular, we know that many of the registered reporting agencies are small businesses. We want to make sure that consumers are protected without creating an undue burden on businesses, especially small enterprises. This would be a key factor in specifying the agencies that would be required to comply with the new rules. This is why our government has committed to consulting broadly with stakeholders and the public to ensure that we get this right.", "Currently, the Consumer Reporting Act gives consumers free access to their consumer report but does not specify a timeline for the agencies to provide it, or electronic access. It does not require scores to be provided to consumers. It does not provide consumers the right to put a security freeze on their information. This government believes that consumers deserve greater access to information held by agencies and more control over how that information is shared.", "The changes, if passed by the Legislature, would give consumers greater electronic access, free of charge, to their own consumer credit report; a consumer score to be provided upon their request up to twice a year, including any consumer scores that were shared with third parties, such as potential creditors, over the past 12 months; and the option of putting in place a security freeze that would prevent agencies from disclosing their credit information, subject to some exceptions which could be set out in regulations.", "The proposed changes offer significant benefits to consumers. Consumers would have greater access to their credit information and be more able to identify their credit standing and any fraudulent activity on their accounts.", "Consumers would also be able to place a security freeze on their information. A security freeze prevents third parties—for example, a potential creditor—from accessing a consumer’s credit information unless the freeze is suspended or cancelled by the consumer. Security freezes are currently a consumer option across the United States but not here in Ontario.", "A freeze may help victims or potential victims of identity theft protect their information. This is why the ministry is proposing to require certain consumer reporting agencies to place a security freeze on an account at the request of the consumer. A security freeze can help diminish the harm caused by identity theft. If you believe your identity has been stolen, a freeze could help prevent someone from opening accounts, like credit cards or lines of credit, in your name.", "The proposal includes regulation-making authority to determine fees for security freezes, which could set out requirements to provide freezes for free, following a breach.", "A freeze could go further than alerts, which are already part of the act. A security alert is an optional service that consumers can use that requires agencies to warn potential creditors to verify an applicant’s identity. It can be a useful tool if you believe that your identity has been compromised, but it does not necessarily prevent a potential creditor from getting information. This is another area where we would want to get detailed feedback from stakeholders so we can be sure to avoid unintended consequences.", "In the past, consumers have highlighted concerns that they have with credit reporting agencies. As stated by the minister the other day, over the past three years there were over 2,000 complaints, incidents and inquiries made to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services regarding the Consumer Reporting Act. Complaints about consumer reporting are among the top 10 common complaints that the ministry receives. The most frequent issues about consumer reporting agencies are incorrect information, wrong individual, and a prohibited practice or a missing requirement. This is part of why this legislation, if passed, will shift the burden from the individual to the credit reporting agency to prove the information is correct. This will protect consumers by ensuring their records are accurate and make it easier for them to correct the record.", "The government’s intent is to capture only the largest agencies, as they deal with the most consumer files and have the broadest reach. We want to ensure that the amendments would balance consumer protection and red tape for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.", "Mr. Speaker, I think consumers deserve to have more control over their credit information and that agencies should be more transparent with all of us. Therefore, I conclude by reiterating Minister MacCharles: Our government’s record when it comes to protecting the consumer rights of Ontarians is unparalleled. In the last year alone we have moved to enhance protections in terms of home inspections, door-to-door sales, payday lending, new home construction, purchasing a new home, living in a condo, travelling and ticket sales.", "This bill, if passed, would join this impressive list and set Ontario apart from all others in terms of our record on consumer protections." ],

One would, of course, understand how important it is to know about the safety records and safety patterns having to do with elevators.", "I remember when this bill first came to the floor of the Legislature. Given the height and the density of the way we are growing in the province of Ontario, one has genuine concerns about the integrity of the disclosure process from a consumer perspective and a safety perspective. I think that we are somewhere in the middle on this act. There is no doubt that there was a need to update and modify the existing rules respecting disclosure of consumer reports, and also from the assessor, who is appointed by the corporation, being allowed to impose an administrative penalty on a person if the assessor is satisfied that the person has contravened or is contravening a prescribed provision of the act. There are parts of this that, quite honestly, could have been handled quite well during regulations.", "That said, the public at large is hungry for greater transparency and accountability with regard to the safety of our elevator systems, in the city of Toronto especially but also in areas like Kitchener-Waterloo, which is established as a good place to grow, and that means we’re going up." ],

You want to be working with the stakeholders at the front, understand their world and then try to find a middle ground that we can actually all abide by. In this case, it seems to me that the TSSA becomes policeman and jury, and this is simply not acceptable. We need to go back to industry.

I think Ontarians deserve consumer protection in terms of when the subject arises about elevator availability. They need to know how reliable the elevator service is in a building where they might be thinking of renting or buying.", "But since this subject is sort of a new study, we need to do some data collection to make a plan in terms of determining what the right course of action would be if elevator ability is not good, or if it’s taking an excessive length of time for an elevator to be repaired, because it’s obviously very, very challenging for the people who are most vulnerable—our seniors, people with disabilities, expectant mothers, mothers with small children—to go up and down the stairs. It can often have a devastating effect on someone’s life if they don’t have the accessibility to be mobile from their home, or to go to work or do whatever needs to be done.", "As well, just a bit on credit reporting: The focus has shifted universally to online or email access for not only credit reports, but other information that we rely on—more on this in future debate." ],

In this building, we have only about four floors and the elevators go down fairly often. We manage on the four floors. Mr. Speaker, you’ve been through it more times than I have, I’m sure. But we see those skyscrapers, I think we can call them, downtown, all the condo construction, and we cannot continue to build condos in the great city of Toronto if we don’t have enough elevator technicians to do the repairs.", "I’m going to switch over a little bit to talk about credit scores because I think that a lot of times people aren’t really aware of their credit rating until maybe it’s time to get a mortgage or things like that. They’re not quite aware of what it all means until they have a problem, unfortunately. People might sometimes start a business with somebody, or marry or move in with somebody, and not be aware of that person’s credit history, and it can be problematic. They wished they would have known, of course, afterwards.", "We see that if this bill becomes law, people will be able to get a credit file disclosure for credit reporting agencies just by giving a request in writing and providing a photocopy of their ID. I think we can all agree that consumers should have the right to access their own information and be able to inquire if they’re worried about fraud. I think that identity theft is a big concern. I think security in general is a big concern. We’re in government and we should have a better understanding and be able to convey to our constituents how important—with passwords and online banking, how careful they have to be. Maybe people have to be a little more proactive.", "I want to give a shout-out to my colleague from Nipissing who put forward a private member’s bill that the government actually adopted, through the Ministry of Education, to create a better program in our high schools to teach financial literacy so that our students should have a better understanding of what it means to pay a credit card, credit card debt, and their credit scores.", "You know, from a woman’s perspective, I just want to mention that it used to be a challenge when oftentimes the men would be taking care of financial matters—I’m sure that sometimes it’s still the case in many of our constituencies, especially with older seniors—and the husband would die, and the wife would have no idea of the financial health of the household. She might not have her name even listed on bank accounts or credit cards, and it could be a real struggle if she has to move and change a mortgage, or renew a mortgage, if she wasn’t listed in the first place. What can we do to warn people to start building their financial profile and ensure that they have that credit rating when they need it?", "We’ve all heard of students who go to university and they’re offered—there’s a booth there encouraging them to get a credit card. On the one hand, I don’t mind students getting credit cards, because it’s good they’re developing their credit history, but on the other hand, I’m concerned about them getting a credit card if they’re not really understanding the problems and the repercussions if the debt gets away from them.", "Relevant data and taking a reasonable look at people’s individual credit—banks have to use this data when they consider an application for a house or a loan, but what this bill does is it establishes the minister’s power to exclude certain data from the credit score calculation. I’m just left wondering if Ontario is going to have different rules than other provinces or other jurisdictions in North America or the world. Well, that could be problematic because then banks, especially now that it’s a global economy—international banking and international businesses—it might put some of our business people at a bit of a disadvantage if international banks or other provinces can’t get the same credit information that they can in other jurisdictions. It’s a question of standardization and what are the unintended consequences when we pass legislation here. Are we possibly making things easier in one aspect but creating difficulties and uncertainty as well?", "We saw there was a recent breach—many recent breaches, actually, but I wanted to highlight the Equifax one and just how sensitive this issue can be when there’s a breach of consumer data, and the absolute need for better security.", "I think that, too often, when you can’t see things, you assume that it’s not a problem and not an issue. But we all know that behind the scenes—we see a fancy website, and it looks like it’s done very professionally, but it doesn’t mean that there is the security behind the scenes that is supporting that website. If we’re giving credit card information or any kind of personal information, how is that information being processed? Who is able to see that information? Is that information being stored?", "Mr. Speaker, since you’re with my caucus, I’m sure you remember that we just recently had a leadership race, and it was a concern for many people who had to upload their driver’s licence or personal information—" ],

It was done during the winter, so of course it was challenging to not make people drive, and they didn’t want to show—we couldn’t do it by having people drive and actually show their driver’s licence. We did it online, and that became a challenge in itself. People were concerned: “Is this information going to be stored or saved? What is going to be done with the information?” We did our best to reassure our members in each of our ridings.", "I’m the critic for the PC caucus for children, youth and families. We went through Bill 89 about a year ago. During committee hearings on Bill 89, we heard from many people who were concerned about financial disclosure and personal information for personal histories in our social welfare system, and what’s being done with that information. Especially, children’s aid societies were concerned about going onto the CPIN, which is the Child Protection Information Network, and putting personal information into a government database. Many people were very concerned about how this was going to be inputted, and who was going to have access to that information.", "Then we heard from the youth who had aged out of care. They were very concerned that their personal information, once they’ve aged out of care, was going to be available to too many people and too many agencies in the province of Ontario.", "There were people who were more from the security, and the financial security experts, who came and spoke to the committee and said that they were very worried about privacy. Specifically they were referring to the security not just between agencies, but the public—people being able to log into the system who shouldn’t have access to this information. The government kind of said, “Well, we’re doing our thorough due diligence, and we are going to make sure that CPIN is secure.”", "The problem came when these agencies had to upload their data to CPIN. The government may have created security for CPIN itself, but once the data was being uploaded to CPIN, there was this no man’s land of no security. You might have data that is secure, and other data that is secure, but the system of uploading the data from one system to another was not at all secure.", "The government basically seemed to take the position, when I questioned the minister many months ago, that it’s not their responsibility. It was their responsibility to make sure that CPIN itself was secure, and I guess that they felt they didn’t have to take the responsibility for the data being uploaded to CPIN. I beg to differ. I think we were all warned.", "It became a problem because, just this past February, two children’s aid societies, the CAS of Oxford county, and Family and Child Services of Lanark, Leeds and Grenville, were both victims of ransomware.

It’s a little bit of people working in information technology who may have limited expertise in what they are achieving. They are perfectly qualified for the work they’re doing, but again, do we have that expertise of security, to ensure that they are understanding all of the dangers of what they are about to do, and how to help them protect themselves from any data breaches?", "Just last week, the former chief of staff to the former Premier had difficulties because he got involved in data and IT and security and deleting emails, and the question partly becomes, who knew what and who really had the strong understanding of how to retrieve data and how important data is? And whose responsibility is it that we safeguard government documents—that’s part of it—but again the taxpayers of Ontario, the residents of Ontario, to safeguard their valuable information in terms of health information, in terms of employment, in terms of any dealings that they’ve had with the government? It’s a big responsibility that we undertake when we represent the people of Ontario, and I think we need to take that responsibility a little more seriously, Mr. Speaker, because we’re in an age of technology now. I think that we’ve all become attached to our devices and we all have our passwords.", "I just had a discussion this morning with one of my staff about how he automatically changes passwords every three months, as you’re supposed to do. I hope people are being very careful. It’s for our Google documents that we change our passwords. He’s always changing the alarm code on the constituency office. This is to be secure, and I understand why he’s doing it, and I understand that some of the things aren’t things that I normally log into, so it doesn’t seem so important for me to be aware. But every now and then I get sort of caught with all these passwords and coming up with codes to save them, because it just becomes impossible. We’re told not to use the same passwords for different things. All these things are supposed to make our lives easier, including credit cards and debit cards, all these kinds of things, but then they make our lives more complicated. So I’m just suggesting that we really do need to maybe have a better understanding and to prioritize people’s valuable information.", "I just wanted to mention, Mr. Speaker, that my office—as did, I’m sure, many offices here—got a communication from TransUnion, which is a credit agency. They’re a major player in the industry, and they complained about not being consulted on this piece of legislation. After all this time in government, and now as another term is ending, it’s kind of surprising when you hear from stakeholders who tell us that they weren’t consulted on pieces of legislation. I’m just going to quote from that letter a little bit. It says, “Bill 8 does not reflect an accurate understanding of either the credit industry or how credit scores are utilized by the financial services industry.” So there was almost no interaction, I guess, with the ministry on much of the bill. The bill doesn’t even address how credit freezes are going to be implemented. I know that this organization wrote to the minister outlining these concerns but has yet to see the concerns addressed.", "That’s problematic. I think we all know that when we are working in the political world, if you say one thing that is factually incorrect, even though the other 20 or 30 or 40 things that you say were absolutely bang on, factually correct, it puts the idea in the public’s mind that you really don’t know what you’re talking about because that one thing is not factually correct.", "So when I hear that somebody who should be consulted isn’t consulted, when that person said they raised concerns and the concerns weren’t addressed, then it just leaves you to have that sort of bad feeling about other aspects as well. It’s a question of, is the bill flawed, and should consumers—and can consumers—be able to pick and choose which of their data is going to be released to creditors? I think we all want to do what we can here in government to ensure that people can have proper credit scores and protect themselves. We don’t want to hear that somebody isn’t able to get a mortgage or a business loan because of problems with their credit scores that aren’t fair.", "We’ve heard a little bit already about the power of TSSA, which is the Technical Standards and Safety Authority. There are some people who have spoken and said that they are concerned about the TSSA becoming judge and jury when handling appeals, that there aren’t very clear criteria right now for penalties and that the TSSA has expanded power to levy fines. What we’ve seen is bureaucracy that’s growing out of control.", "Here we have a world where everything is online and people can do so much, and the fact is, we think there should be less bureaucracy. I just renewed, for the first time with ServiceOntario yesterday, my car registration permits. This is the first time that I haven’t actually had to go into ServiceOntario to get my sticker. Supposedly, they’re going to mail it. I can get back to you and let you know if I get it in a week, as they say. It was such a great website, I actually tweeted about it. It was so well done and so easy. I want to compliment whoever designed the website, because the font was big. A lot of times you have a big, white screen and the font is quite tiny. It was very easy to use and really a pleasure. They already had the information from Drive Clean that I did at Canadian Tire. That was already uploaded on the system.", "So we know that with all of this new technology and apps and things like that, there should be less bureaucracy in government, because the people can do so much themselves. They don’t have to call somebody; they don’t have to pick up a pen and paper and write somebody. They can get the information themselves. It’s up to us to reduce the costs, to reduce the bureaucracy and to make things technically easier to access for people. We’re seeing an older and older demographic on computers able to access information on their own.", "I just wanted to mention, again, people not taking care of bills and credit cards on their own, and then having their partner or their spouse pass away—or leave them, or they leave them—and finding themselves sort of floundering. I would really urge everybody to check into whether or not they are part of the account, or they just have a credit card but it’s somebody else’s account, in which case, are they really building up their own credit score? A lot of people might think they have a credit card, but do you have a credit card account? If you have a bank account in your name that’s not a joint account, do you have a beneficiary for that account? A lot of people don’t bother to put a beneficiary for their RRSP or their tax-free savings account or their bank accounts.", "These are all very important things. It really is important for us to share that information somehow with our constituents, and to do that PR work that we all do. I know we do public awareness campaigns on so many things, but I think that this is sometimes a tough topic when people come into our constituency offices to meet with us. You don’t want to ask people, “Are you trying to pay down your credit card debt?” Or, if they have too much credit card debt, “Have you considered going into your bank to speak about a personal loan, which is a much lower interest rate and will make it that much easier for you to get out of debt?”", "I really appreciate the time that I had to say a few words on this topic." ],

I’ve got question two, but I may not make it because I’m stuck in an elevator, so somebody may have to ask my question at question period.” Those are scary things, Speaker.", "I also remember—what was it, 14 years and eight months ago, something like that—the blackout in 2003, where people were stuck on elevators for a long time. Many lasting friendships came out of that. I remember, as a reporter at the CBC in Windsor at the time, I was watching the lights in Detroit. As darkness descended, there were a few lights left on by a generator, but otherwise, the skyline of Detroit was very dark that night. I have heard since then that, actually, some people that met on the elevators 14 years ago now have teenagers. Those relationships were forged by meeting and spending time in an elevator together before they could be rescued.", "I think the importance of having elevators that work is essential.

There were people within that building who had accessibility issues, who were disabled. He went and he met with those folks, with this particular family, and he did a press conference shortly after that and was very emotional. He was crying and said that if he became mayor, he would deal with these issues.", "You have to sometimes, as a politician, see it first-hand, to see, when accessibility is denied, how that impacts the quality of people’s lives.", "We do have, of course, the AODA in the province of Ontario—I’m always doing this circle back to the elevator conversation—but the AODA has had some limited success, only in the fact that there are businesses and organizations who don’t have the funds to go that extra distance and to put in quality accessibility measures.", "Elevators are very expensive to put in, I must tell you.

You will see commercials on a regular basis now. There’s a whole new generation who have recognized that building up your credit is actually very important, especially when you, as a first-time homebuyer, seek that first-time mortgage. If you’ve missed bills, if you haven’t made payments, there is this scoring system, which should be accessible to you as a consumer. I think that this is obviously a measure that we fully support as part of Bill 8. Consumers should be able to access their own credit information.

We’ve seen several breaches around personal information, if you’ve been following the Facebook and privacy strategies that they have not upheld, those guidelines that they have not upheld. It’s very worrisome to people in the province of Ontario. There’s a whole new generation who have grown up in this culture of sharing everything: when they go on vacation and how much money they spent at this store, and the fact that there is an Internet of things and organizations and things like Facebook and Twitter and some of the other social media platforms that track your whereabouts, track your patterns as a consumer, so that that information can be bought and sold to other jurisdictions is really, truly alarming. I think we’re going to have to spend some time in the education system educating a whole new generation that you shouldn’t share every single thing about your life.

It should not be a surprise to anyone in this House that the trend around employment is part-time, precarious, contract work. That actually is a barrier to saving money and to building up a strong sort of level of savings that you can actually leverage into future investments.", "I was actually mentioning to them how this trend has become more and more prevalent across the province of Ontario and this made me think of the CodeRed report that came out last year. I think you’ll remember it, Speaker. It said Ontario is the second-worst economy in Canada for younger generations. They specifically mention the home ownership piece. Home ownership is much harder. In 1976-80, it took five years of full-time work to save up for a 20% down payment on a home. In 2003 it took eight years. But today, after 15 years of a Liberal government, it takes 15-plus years, on average, to build up enough income, enough savings, enough credit scores to actually warrant securing a very large mortgage. In the city of Toronto or the greater GTA, it’s almost impossible, Mr. Speaker, for this generation to save up $200,000 for a down payment.", "The integrity of these credit scores is important. We support having full access to those credit scores for young people across the province. But this is the connection piece to housing. Housing, of course, is one of the great stabilizers for our economy. When shelter becomes so expensive, when you spend over 50% of your take-home pay and your income on shelter, it leaves very little for you to actually build up your credit rating, build up some security for when your part-time, precarious, contract work becomes very unstable—which actually is something that we are tracking in the province of Ontario and is quite worrisome.", "The other piece is about protecting your own financial information and credit information. The other end of the spectrum would be the seniors across the province of Ontario. We did learn in another report, which I have somewhere, that there are now more seniors in the city of Toronto than there are children. So the demographics change the way we as legislators should implement legislation. I think that we have a responsibility, as those who are elected within our communities across the province, to watch for the trends, the demographic trends, the financial trends and the economic trends and then tailor legislation to that. It’s very clear that, from a consumer protection perspective, seniors are becoming more vulnerable as banking systems become more technical, as social media becomes one of those ways that businesses, corporations and, yes, banks communicate with their customers. I think there’s a responsibility that we have to ensure that credit information is readily available for those who own it, but that it’s also protected from those who want access to it. When I look at seniors across this province, we could do more to protect their interests and certainly adapt to that demographic.", "The other issue around credit scores and, of course, building credit has to do with women across the province of Ontario. The previous speaker mentioned that there was a time and a place when many women across the province weren’t working. In fact, 28% of the women in this province identify that they only work part-time because they can only find access to quality, affordable child care for part-time care. And so there’s a direct correlation to women’s economic success and prosperity and therefore their ability to save and build credit based on the policies that are currently in play.", "Supporting women to have access to education or economic potential through job creation opportunities is really underpinned by those two things, housing and child care. We may have come a long way, baby, in this regard, but we’ve still got a long way to go to ensure that women reach their economic potential. That economic potential, I would argue, is very much connected to equality and closing that gender pay gap.", "The issue around the TSSA and the expanded power that the TSSA has within Bill 8 has been mentioned by previous speakers. I guess I would compare it—because I’ve heard the same concerns around the transparency and the accountability of the TSSA—to Tarion. Tarion was another agency that was arm’s length, that was meant to administer the new home warranty plan across the province, and also registered new home builders across the province. I can tell you that this has been one of those issues that I have consistently heard of across Kitchener–Waterloo and Waterloo region. But when I was finance critic, almost without fail, every budget cycle, every finance committee, whether it was in the northeast or south or west, the consumer advocacy groups took great issue and great exception at the powers that Tarion had and then the lack of follow-through for that agency to actually protect the consumers. These concerns were loud. I believe they are real. And even when the government had an opportunity to modernize Tarion as a stand-alone agency, I think that those efforts were seriously watered down.", "I think that we’ve heard the same concerns as some of the opposition members who have raised long-standing issues with the TSSA and who have raised a red flag, if you will, about expanded powers for the TSSA.", "Now, one of the final issues that I want to address is elevator technicians, because 20 years ago—actually, now it’s much longer; 25, 26 years ago—when I was at Otis elevators for that first job, I described that sort of—this was when people still smoked at their desks. There were still lots of cocktails at lunchtime. When I say that it was like the Mad Men show, the advertising show, I’m not exaggerating. I really thought that this was the world of business. I got a quick lesson as soon as I moved into the public sector, I can tell you—very much.", "The lack of elevator technicians is directly connected to the lack of progress that we’ve made with regard to apprenticeships in the province of Ontario. There are a couple of contributing factors to why we find ourselves with a shortage, or very close to being a complete drop-off, because our skilled workers who are building Ontario up when those projects do come along are aging out. First of all, it’s very physical work, many of these jobs, and so working until you are 70 is really a challenge.", "The education system: This was an issue when I first became a trustee in 2003 and then was president of the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association up until 2012. We seem to have forgotten that we still need people to do the work. We’re not going to be able to build a whole new economy by building a new app, for instance. Somewhere along the line, the value of the skilled trades has been lost, and we really need to have a concerted effort of fostering those positions.", "We’re making some progress on STEM, or STEAM now: science, technology, engineering, arts and math. Now we call it STEAM. We’re making some progress in that regard to have more women come into those fields. The skilled trades are well-paid jobs, and we need everyone to be part of those new jobs, which are essentially, in some regards, very traditional but very technical.", "The elevator technicians: Given the way that we are growing as a province, given some of the legislation and that we are going up, we need to have the technicians (1) to install and (2) to maintain, because the other side of the conversation and the equation is that once elevators become part of the culture of a building and you have 39 floors, walking up and down those stairs becomes a real challenge. And as mentioned, it’s also an accessibility issue and a safety issue, Mr. Speaker. I’m incorporating that into availability, because if you don’t have the workforce to install and to maintain elevators across this city and across this province, then it’s very hard to improve accessibility and to address the safety of our institutions and our buildings.", "I think that I will leave it there because I think I did a pretty good job of talking about a piece of legislation for 20 minutes, if I do say so myself.

My colleague has mentioned getting housing, getting transportation, buying a car and investing in business. A credit rating will always be important for that. So I think the way in which we want to give the tools to consumers to protect the information about them, ensure that they protect themselves against identity theft by maybe using a security freeze—all of these, I think, are really important tools that we’re going to give to people to deal with themselves and protect themselves in the current economy." ],

We do put a lot of faith in every elevator we step into, Speaker. It’s a steel cage, held by steel cables intertwined on a pulley system to take us up and down. It’s like going to the ATM and taking out $200 and getting 10 twenties but not counting them. You just take for granted that you’re going to get 10 twenties when you ask for $200.

I would like to say that her speech was uplifting, but I might be accused of taking the opportunity to make a terrible pun. But I digress.", "In all seriousness, we do depend and rely on elevators, and elevator availability is critical. About two years ago in my riding, we had an elevator in a building that had a large number of people who had disabilities. It wasn’t a big building; it was about six storeys. About three or four times in that summer, it went out of service. And that’s what they had. You can imagine, in a hot summer, what had to happen. People had to get out to appointments or people needed some urgent medical care. It was more than a real concern; it was, “We have to send over the fire department.”", "So I think the work of the member from Trinity–Spadina and the work inside this bill with regard to elevator availability and the TSSA—I don’t think it’s fair to make an analogy between Tarion and the TSSA. Their mandates are different. I’ve had some experience working with them on some things. With all outside agencies, we always get concerned about governance, but the mandate of the TSSA is specifically safety and ensuring that the standards that we expect for safety are met by those people who either do the repairs or deliver the services, and the engineers. They do things from boilers to amusement rides. It’s a wide variety of things, so I don’t think it’s fair to make that analogy. I wanted to put that out there.", "I also want to say that I believe that the credit measures in this bill are really important to protect people’s information with regard to big data, and to give them information as well." ],

My mom, Sheila, was telling me the story about how she got her credit in the 1960s. This was in the time period when salespeople would sell vacuum cleaners door to door. Do you remember the Electrolux? I guess this salesman once came into the apartment in Kingston, and he dumped a bunch of dirt on the floor, took out the vacuum cleaner and cleaned it up. She was really impressed. She had two small kids in the house, so she was probably really happy to have the company as well. Because she did the monthly payments through Electrolux, that’s how her credit rating was established. So there was a time and a place—because they were not part of the workforce, that’s how women generated their credit rating: making very small monthly payments.", "The member from Ottawa South said it’s not fair to compare the TSSA to Tarion.

The real problem is that they’ve got themselves in an awful lot of debt. In Guelph, we would often refer somebody like that to Family Counselling and Support Services; they have a great debt counselling service there that we often refer our constituents to.", "But what this bill would do is let people get at the information quickly about their actual credit report, because a lot of people really aren’t aware of what credit reporting agencies are saying about them and what information is being released.", "This bill proposes amendments to the legislation such that, when requested by a consumer, a credit reporting agency would have to provide consumers with their credit history and credit score electronically—so you can email it back—at least twice a year. They would not be allowed to charge a fee for this. This is important, because if you’re somebody who is already in trouble, the last thing in the world you need is for somebody to charge you money to figure out what the problem is and exactly what your status is.", "Agencies would have to provide, as part of a consumer’s report, any scores given to third parties within the past 12 months. That is, you can figure out who has been asking about you for the past 12 months. That’s another thing of which we are all delightfully oblivious. People are looking at our credit history, and we have no idea who’s asking questions and who’s finding out information about us.", "When you put this all together, it will help the consumer understand the information that the agency has and that they are providing to others about you.", "Then there’s the other aspect of this which allows a consumer to freeze the information, which means nobody can give it out; your credit is just frozen. That’s really, really important, because another thing of which we are perhaps somewhat unaware is the frequency with which people’s identities are stolen.", "I know I had one employee in Guelph who, while using her credit card at a gas station, not once but twice had her credit card information stolen.

He came in and was talking in caucus about this particular problem. He said, “We’ve got a real problem with the behaviour of elevator companies.”", "The other, from my good friend and colleague from Beaches–East York, is another private member’s bill that came out of some of the problems that he had confronted with some of the people going into his constituency office.", "Both of these were put together into this one particular bill, Bill 8, the Access to Consumer Credit Reports and Elevator Availability Act.", "Now, in continuing, when I lived out on the west coast and worked for a public relations firm there, one of the guys I played hockey with on the weekend, the other goaltender, was a guy who worked at a law firm just across the street from us on West Hastings Street. He had this jersey that some of their litigation guys had. It had a pair of law scales, and the motto of their law team was underneath it. The motto was, “Dull Is Profitable.”", "I remembered that because in looking at these two industries—consumer credit reporting and elevator maintenance—these are quintessentially dull industries that not too many people pay attention to. In so doing, not only are they both very profitable industries, but because nobody pays attention to them, you’ll find that the business model is heavily skewed toward that small number of firms that completely dominate the marketplace.", "When that happens, one of the things that you can do as a government, where what you’re looking at is what we call an oligopoly—a small number of firms with a disproportionate share of the market—is to say, “We can restore some degree of order, fairness and equity to this particular market that may not exist because of the de facto behaviour of the participants in it, through legislation.” That’s what this does.", "My colleague from Guelph explained some of the points with regard to both elevator availability and credit score reporting very eloquently, and earlier I was talking about credit score reporting as well.", "What this bill does is to put in place a number of measures that prevent the vendors in those two marketplaces from making money coming and going. So, for example, what it says is, if as a consumer what you really want to have is your credit score, then the very people who aggregate your data—collect your data and turn around and make money by selling it to people from whom you would otherwise like to get a loan or gain credit—if you want to ask, “What data do you have on me?” and “Show me what you’re showing them”—first of all, prior to this it wasn’t very easy to get. Secondly, they would often charge you money for showing you what amounts to your own intellectual property. That’s completely wrong. And that’s one of the things that this bill does, and does very elegantly: to say that the information about you actually belongs to you. And, as it actually belongs to you, then whoever is the custodian of it—in this case, the credit reporting agency—that custodian has to share it with you.", "So, in those senses, two dull but profitable businesses are, through this legislation, being called to account, and some degree of equity, transparency and fairness is being restored to a marketplace where the playing field had been tilted seriously against the people from whom the data comes, or the apartment dwellers who make up the marketplace." ],

There are four elevators. As someone said earlier, one of them usually is locked because there are people moving in and out. The other one is for the club that built the condos on top of their club. So there are two for all 40-some floors. That is very difficult at high-usage times of the day or if there is any other problem.", "Specifically, improved elevator availability would benefit people with health and mobility issues who can’t use the stairs and are stranded when elevators break down.", "I heard one of our colleagues talk about a person who basically could not go back to their home for four days. That should not happen. Hopefully, this bill will help to curtail that kind of problem.", "Improvements in the availability of elevators would also help residents of multi-storey buildings to receive faster emergency service. This should be a high priority. There are a lot of people in my riding who have moved into condos and who are seniors. They have sold their homes, moved into condos and quite often have health issues and would need the availability for paramedics, fire and police services.", "Proposed improvements in the action plan include better access for first responders through a proposed amendment to the Ontario Fire Code. The amendments would require elevator owners to notify local fire services when a firefighters’ elevator is out of service for more than 24 hours. That seems reasonable and fair.", "New reporting requirements on elevator services and availability, and an obligation on TSSA to make that information available to the public, would result in better transparency for the public regarding elevator availability and would ultimately inform a repair timeline standard.", "Education and awareness for elevator owners and operators, involving the Accessibility Directorate of Ontario, would support compliance with existing requirements for notice of service disruptions, encourage faster response and repairs by elevator owners, and improve access for users.", "Administrative monetary penalties to motivate compliance with elevator maintenance requirements would enhance safety for residents of multi-storey buildings. This seems fair. If you can’t get to it in a timely manner, then you should have some kind of penalty.", "Public safety would also be enhanced through new protocols and procedures to deal with elevator entrapments. I know there are people in this Legislature who have great problems with getting in elevators; I don’t know whether it’s from past experiences. I myself do not feel that way about being in an elevator, but I know some people have had bad experiences, and it affects them for the rest of their lives.", "With each step taken, the government plans to ensure that its commitment to ensure public safety remains the priority.", "We understand that out-of-service elevators can be a source of frustration for residents, especially for elderly people or people with disabilities. We also recognize that prospective buyers and residents in new and existing housing units in multi-storey buildings may be concerned about affordability and availability of housing.", "To fulfill our action plan and determine the appropriate balance between costs and benefits, we need to collect and analyze all the data to fully assess the options.", "We intend to develop education and awareness materials to inform owners about the importance of planning and funding the replacement of elevators when they can no longer be repaired in a timely manner.", "We will also help owners understand the importance of effective preventive maintenance, maintenance contract terms and regulations pertaining to elevators.", "I think that this bill will make it very obvious to the people who are in charge of maintaining the elevators that it is important to everyone in Ontario that the elevators be maintained and, if they are not suitable, that they be replaced." ],

I heard it from many of the Liberals. They often use the term of elevators and fire alarms at the same time—the impression I got from their discussions was that, somehow, the elevators were broken. I just wanted to put this forward: It is mandatory in Ontario, under our fire code, that in a multi-storey building, on a fire alarm, the elevators have to come down. That is the fire code. The elevators have to come down to the ground floor during a fire alarm situation. It’s the fire code that mandates that. That is for safety reasons, Speaker. There are good, safe reasons why that is part of the fire code.", "It just seemed that many of the Liberals were being confused. I wanted to add that clarification to them that during a fire alarm, it is not that the elevators are broken. They are being recalled to the ground floor for safety reasons, ensuring that the occupants egress out the building through the fire-rated stairwells.", "Maybe you want to take a look at the fire code. I know there are a lot of laws in this province, and a lot of laws that the Liberals don’t really know are there and why they are there.

Our party, the PCs, remains dedicated to ensuring Ontario is the best place in North America to do business.

I’ll just finish on the SAMS computer scandal that cost at least $300 million and move on.", "When we talk about consumer protection, I would have liked to have seen something like that put in for taxpayers because, after all, this is about giving people relief.

Mr. Cunningham’s report offered 19 recommendations aimed at improving elevator availability.", "Interestingly, I have heard a question raised with regard to the TSSA having the authority to revoke contractor licences if they are failing to meet their obligations under the TSSA act.

As I mentioned earlier in one of my remarks, the TSSA becomes policeman and jury.

We don’t want to create situations where we’re punitively impacting people just because we haven’t gone out and really understood the front lines.", "I’ve heard a lot of people today in the debate talk about, obviously, the safety and the timelines. Well, a lot of our older elevators in particular are at the age where they don’t have parts available very quickly. It’s great to say, “You will have this done in two weeks,” but there is also the practicality—and then imposing a fine immediately because you can’t make that, even though there are realities of not having that part. We’ve heard about the technicians and not enough supply of technicians, which again goes back to the skilled trades and all of the changes that the government has made in 15 years that actually have limited a lot of those skilled trades and the ability for people, particularly our young people, to come through some of the apprenticeship programs and make sure that we have a robust supply of those people.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m going to talk a little bit about feedback on this issue from David Lepofsky, the chair of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance, or the AODA Alliance, and independent elevator contractors.", "Mr. Lepofsky—and I’ve had the pleasure of meeting with him a number of times on various issues, in my capacity as critic for accessibility—is a well-regarded, well-researched gentleman who brings concerns on behalf of Ontarians at large. I always respect the time and effort that he puts into it. He’s a great champion for the accessibility sector, and he did echo the need for real action in this area.", "As well, the AODA has said that there should be a clear requirement in the law for having Braille, large print and voice output of floor announcements in all new elevators in buildings that serve the public.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, in the current world that we’re in, I think that would be an absolute expectation of any building that you’re walking in, that we’ve been able to do that to allow people with other challenges to be able to have the same accessibility as we do, and to be able, obviously, to have Braille so that they can read, to understand. For those who might be visually impaired, certainly it makes sense that you would have the voice output of floor announcements. I think there are some great things that we can do as long as we work collaboratively.", "It is a bit of a surprise that the Liberal government had an opportunity to make some of these changes back in 2013 but did not, and passed on the opportunity to include accessibility amendments in the Ontario building code.", "Again, when I come to the door and I read this draft legislation, you start to say, “If it was in there in 2013 and you didn’t, give me at least the rationale. Explain to me very clearly, so that we understand why that didn’t happen.”", "At the end of the day, if there are good ideas—I’ve been in committee here many, many times where there were many, many amendments to legislation, and the government just said, “No, we don’t have to listen. We’re going to go forward.”", "In this case, again, when you’re talking about accessibility and standards for people who need to know that we actually care and have the compassion to include them in our legislation, I can’t understand why that would not have happened. It’s a surprise, but it is also a concern, considering the government’s repeated promise to make Ontario fully accessible by 2025.", "I think accessibility for 1.9 million Ontarians with disabilities is, sadly, far off the government’s radar and certainly not a priority for this government.", "We heard the words “disability” and “accessibility” mentioned zero times in their pre-election budget and throne speech, which included big promises to many sections of our voters, but again nothing tangible for the accessibility community. That saddens me, Mr. Speaker, because that community of 1.9 million Ontarians definitely deserves for us to be making sure that they are a priority in all sectors of our legislation.", "Remember, Mr. Speaker, it took this government five years just to set up a committee on education accessibility—five years just to set up a committee. I’m not certain how anybody could defend that at any time, that it took you five years to set up a committee, especially on something as important as accessibility.", "How ironic that this government was quick to waste billions of dollars on scandals like eHealth, $8 billion; smart meters, $2 billion; cancelling gas plants, $1.1 billion; and paying an exorbitant $6.2-million salary to the CEO of Hydro One, but they have offered nothing beyond minimal to Ontarians with disabilities, who continue to face very high unemployment rates that former Lieutenant Governor, David Onley, the government’s accessibility adviser, called “a national shame.”", "What’s worse, Mr. Speaker? That the Liberal government had 15 years to get on schedule for full accessibility by 2025 but didn’t do it, or that their binge-spending budget designed to buy votes and keep Kathleen Wynne in power at Queen’s Park forgot so much as to mention accessibility? Either way, Mr. Speaker, how can the accessibility community possibly trust this government when it continues to leave behind 1.9 million Ontarians with disabilities?", "In this sense, Bill 8 is an important bill. I want to thank the Minister of Government and Consumer Services for paying attention and recognizing that elevator downtime can mean a resident being unable to go to work, to go to the grocery store or to a doctor’s appointment and being confined to their apartment.", "As I said right off the start, Mr. Speaker, safety has to be the most important concern, absolutely, and we have to do that in a manageable way and a respectful way, and we have to actually work with industry to make sure that we provide the ability for them to service and make sure they maintain standards as they’re set. Setting them up for failure is not good for anyone, the residents—it certainly isn’t good for the industry and it certainly isn’t good to encourage when we already know we have a shortage. We need more people to enter as technicians in those types of accessory programs that are going to support things like elevator safety and maintenance, going forward.", "We’re building, as you know—I mean, a couple of years ago here in Toronto, we had 225 cranes in the air building skyscrapers. We’re going to need more and more. All of those are huge, multi-unit developments. We’re going to need more technicians.

As per my earlier comment, we remain concerned with the lack of accountability from the TSSA. Last week we were debating a bill and they wanted to bring in compliance inspectors. Compliance inspectors: That to me says you’re going in to find fault. You’re going in as an inspector trying to find—as opposed to more of what I was told, certainly in the long-term care, of which I am, again, proud to be the critic for, the culture used to be, “We want to come in and coach you. We want to find a way to get us all to a better place.” Now they come in and they’re punitive. They find the fault and they fine you, which puts added duress because many of the years of funding levels were stopped or flatlined for that whole industry. To change that culture back to one of actually working with you and coaching to allow you to find compliance, to be in compliance, as opposed to, “We’re going to come in and we’re going to set penalties.”", "As I shared earlier, they have no idea what standard they are being inspected to. Would you not think, when you bring out a bill, that you should at least have the basics of definitions? You should be able to define the terms within that piece of legislation. Clear and unambiguous is what every piece of legislation should be in this House, Mr. Speaker. So I find it strange that again they brought out yet another bill that’s actually going to bring in standards that they don’t even define. That leaves additional requirements for an unqualified inspector to impose on the licensee. The bill gives the TSSA the power to impose stiff monetary penalties on licensees and takes away their right to appeal or even defend themselves.", "Mr. Speaker, I think that in Ontario and in Canada we always expect as a culture that we are very open people, that we are very amenable people to actually having rational discussions to be able to find a way—and if we’re in fault, then we should have at least the ability to defend and challenge and find a middle ground that we, again, can find that works for everyone. When you take away the ability to even appeal, I’m not certain what that means in this legislation. Again, you would hope that this would have been brought forward with those things defined.", "The TSSA, as I said earlier, becomes policeman and jury. I’m not certain how that works, Mr. Speaker, particularly if you’re in the industry and they want to be punitive. You have an inspector who really goes extreme and you can’t even defend yourself. You’re coming in front of the same people who are bound and determined to take you out of the equation. I’m not certain how I could support that piece, so I’m hoping that the government will be open to some amendments and actually providing more detail—again, back to a clear, unambiguous definition of the terms of this piece of legislation would have been very helpful and certainly would have made it much easier for us.", "I’ve talked very briefly about one of the concerns that has come out and is a part of this bill. Again, I give the member credit for bringing this. It has been an issue. Certainly, in this building, at times, we’ve have some challenges. In my early couple of years in the building where I live when I’m in Toronto for part of the week, we had major challenges with our elevators. But again, it came back to technicians in many cases—an undersupply.", "I’m not certain why this government was so intent on cancelling a lot of the high-skills major trades programs out in our rural communities. That’s like—for the minister without portfolio; I know he’s a big sports fan—you always want to have a good feeder system to feed the big leagues. In skilled trades, I’m not certain why that would be any different.", "I see the Minister of Labour. He’s a good guy. I’m not certain why, at times, he does some legislation that restricts the ability for us to actually have our skilled trades.", "The nuclear industry is certainly in a growth stage. I worked at Bruce Power; I’ll be very open and forthright on that. Walking on the floor, I saw how many people were at the end of their career tenure. I didn’t see where those skilled trades were that were going to be able to feed that. We’re going to refurbish all of the reactors across Ontario over the next 35 years. We need that skilled trades component.", "It’s very similar with the elevators. We have a lot of holdbacks because we don’t have enough people to fix them. As I shared earlier, some of those pieces of equipment in this building—I believe some of the elevators here are original construction, if not all of them. If you think back 100 years to try to have that component, that piece, and the skilled trades to be able to machine that part, you can’t impose a strict two-week “You have to do this,” because it may not be reality.", "How do you be punitive? Work with the groups. And it has to be some manageable time frame that the sector, the technicians, the actual licensees and the owner of the building—I don’t think any owner out there is not willing to come to the table and say, “I’m trying to be respectful of the people who are actually living in my building.” If there are bad culprits out there who aren’t doing that, and it’s continually found, then go after them, but don’t whitewash. I say this with all due reverence to the government across the floor: A lot of what I’ve seen here in my seven years is that they whitewash everybody instead of going after the people who are the culprits.", "In long-term care, it’s very similar. They’re adding more regulation. Everybody has to add more bureaucracy and red tape as opposed to going after the people who are truly not diligent in doing what needs to be done for the benefit of other people.", "I will just summarize, Mr. Speaker, in regard to the credit history. I want to just bring up that I think consumer protection is absolutely critical and very important. Taxpayers, the people who we are given the privilege and the opportunity to represent—I think they would certainly suggest that they expect the government to always have, at the forefront of their thoughts, consumer protection, but I’m not truly convinced.", "I’m going to give a couple of examples just to finalize, for those people at home watching. I’m not certain that people at home would suggest that the Liberals are truly in the mindset of consumer protection when they will borrow $25 billion for some hydro relief for two years knowing full well that the rates are going to go up and it’s going to cost $93 billion to pay it back. And that’s when we’re already spending $1 billion a month on our debt payments. I’m not certain that they could say they had consumer protection when the Green Energy Act was imposed on our municipalities in our province, which is going to cost $133 billion over the lifetime of that guarantee. The eHealth scandal—I’m giving examples, Mr. Speaker. I just want to show that consumer protection is a big thing for people. I think they expect it; I think they deserve it from government. But when you see things like that and you bring in a bill like this—you have to be able to talk on both of them. You can’t just, in isolation, talk about consumer protection when it comes to a credit rating when you’re actually destroying our credit rating as a province.", "When I think of consumer protection, I think of the taxpayer.

That’s something that at some point the government members will have to answer to, that over these past few years a lot of money has gone out the door for reasons that we didn’t necessarily have to do." ],

I always thought that members of a Legislature, particularly provincially—although federally they have some matters that are related to consumer protection as well, certainly. But these were ones that were favourites of individual members. My friend from Sarnia–Lambton, for instance, has come forward with a number of bills that relate generally to consumer protection, and others in the House. I do that only because I look across the floor and see him there, and I know that he has done that.", "This bill is very good for the people of the province, but it builds on a number of other bills the government has brought forward. I was delighted on March 1 because—all of us have encountered this—a new bill came into effect that dealt with door-to-door scams, as I want to call them. You and I, Speaker, and others in the House have felt that some of our constituents were duped by people coming to the door with a proposition that sounded very good and was actually too good to be true.", "As a result of various ideas coming forward, letters being sent to ministers, speeches in this House and work in committee, we found that bills were evolving into something substantive in terms of a legislative initiative to protect the consumer. This bill builds on that particular initiative, and I think it’s deserving of the support of all members.", "I did hear once in a while the member, when he was actually on the bill, making some positive reference to the provisions of this bill, and I want to congratulate him on the one or two minutes he took to deal with the bill itself and the positive aspects of it." ],

The mismanagement that this government has had over the last 15 years and tripling the debt to $300 billion, with $1 billion a month in interest payments—this government could have done better, but they haven’t.", "We have heard all day, every day for the last four years at this Legislature, this government heckle us every time we had the opportunity to speak.

That’s what we’re going to campaign on.” They didn’t do that.

I have got the Villa Aubin in the great municipality of West Nipissing. It’s a two-storey seniors’ housing, and the seniors’ group is led by Claudette Desjardins. They have been fighting for an elevator, because if you have a two-storey building with no elevator—this is throughout Ontario, but this is an issue in my riding.", "These people have been lobbying and organizing. They’ve done petitions. They asked for a meeting with me. I was expecting a meeting with two people, and it was more like 35 people. My constituency office in Sturgeon Falls is on the second floor, above the post office, but there is an elevator, so they took note of that. Actually, what’s holding that elevator up is a lack of funding in a federal program; it’s not even a provincial program. But there are elevator issues.", "One of the members—I believe it was the member from Grey-Bruce, Mr. Walker—spent a while talking about accessibility. That is going to become a huge issue, because it’s one thing to talk about accessibility; it’s another thing to actually guarantee it. In a lot of these public buildings, if you have a two-storey building with only stairs, that’s not accessibility.", "In the case of Villa Aubin, everyone wants to move downstairs, and I don’t blame them, because as you get older, it gets harder and harder. I’ve noticed it myself: It’s harder and harder to get up stairs. And so, for the people of Villa Aubin, we are going to continue to lobby on their behalf. I’m sure everyone in this House will agree with me that we all have to lobby for people in cases like this, because they all need elevators.", "I don’t think it would be a shock to people in the rest of Ontario that there are not a lot of high-rise elevators in my riding. I think the highest building in my riding is the Holiday Inn in Temiskaming Shores; I think it’s four storeys. That’s the limit of my elevators. But there are a lot of two-storey elevators, and if you think you have troubles getting an elevator technician here at Queen’s Park, try getting an elevator technician at the Northdale Manor in Temiskaming Shores. Again, it’s a retirement home with an elevator, but I know that the board, the administration, has had so much trouble trying to get that elevator to work. Again, there’s not a local elevator technician in the district of Timiskaming, and I doubt if there’s one in Cochrane." ],

We have troubles with the elevators here, and this is the government. You would think we’d be on the priority list. Well, if we’re on the priority list, imagine the places around the province that aren’t on the priority list.", "But that is a huge issue. I’m really trying to push for Villa Aubin and all of the other two-storey residences—and there are probably three- and four-storey, but certainly in my riding they’re all two-storey. As our population gets older, these people are severely disadvantaged. It’s something we’re going to have to come to grips with, because I believe there’s accessibility legislation on the books now.", "We in this place are great at coming up with regulations, much of it very well needed. But in the case where those regulations affect public buildings, we are also going to have to be responsible to ensure that those regulations are not just enforced, but that we help fund them, because it’s often the case that we are good with the stick but not so great with the mortar. That’s something that we have to deal with.", "This is actually a bill that’s a bit confusing, because it has three things in it that don’t really—the two do, the TSSA and the elevators kind of mesh; but the Consumer Reporting Act does not mesh with the TSSA and the elevators. It’s a bit confusing.", "The consumer reporting part is very important. People sometimes comment that I talk about my family a lot, but one of my daughters had her identity stolen, and until you go through that process, you don’t know how that can put a damper on your life, short-term, certainly. Losing your identity, although it might not directly have to do with the Consumer Reporting Act—it does, because we’re talking about protecting people’s credit rating and knowing who can view your credit rating. Those are all really important issues.", "That, to me, could have been an issue on its own for a fulsome discussion. Especially now that we’ve become, with technology and social media—I know for sure, personally, that I don’t know how to fully protect my identity, and I don’t know what information is out there about me. I’m a public person; I fully expect that people would know a lot about me. But I think a lot of people are unaware of what’s really going on. So that should be a fulsome discussion, and we support what’s in this bill regarding that.", "The second issue—and whenever you’re ready, Speaker, you can just tell me." ],

Bill 174 began debate a week ago in this House. It’s an omnibus bill that has substantial and significant unrelated public policy provisions in that bill. It has the creation of a new cannabis retail corporation. It has the framework to complement the federal legislation to permit legalized recreational cannabis use. It also has a schedule for the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, which will have significant ramifications on tobacco harm reduction.", "It also has a schedule for school bus safety and other unrelated Highway Traffic Act amendments that have nothing to do with cannabis. Nothing, nothing at all do these very disparate subjects have—it is unwarranted for them to be in the same piece of legislation, and it is unprecedented that a government, in a Western democracy, in a country that is held in the highest regard around the world, is acting like a tin pot authoritarian.", "We have seen so often that this government has taken a path, a path that we have never seen the likes of before in this country.

Smoke-Free Ontario Act ... and amendments to the Highway Traffic Act.”", "That’s a proper way of doing legislation in a proper democracy. Bundling these things up into an omnibus bill and then having the gall to bring in a time allocation motion a week after the introduction—I don’t think I have to tell anybody in this House that legalizing recreational cannabis and creating a cannabis retail corporation are new steps in our country. These are transformational steps, Speaker. They require the robustness of a full debate to safeguard the public interest when we are taking on such substantial new policies.", "Six and a half hours of debate, and the government brings in a time allocation motion.

By the time it gets to committee—well, frankly, the fact that the government wants to shut down debate shows that they’ve already made up their minds and are not interested in listening to the people of this province. But I know that my constituent Jon Liedtke would love to have an opportunity to have some of his questions and concerns around this bill answered, and he is not the only one.

He is a medical marijuana user. He has a licence; he has a prescription to be able to consume cannabis for some health concerns. An interesting piece that he brought to my attention is that there is a piece in the bill that is not entirely clear. It talks about how you cannot transport a prescribed substance. It doesn’t say “cannabis.” It doesn’t say “prescribed cannabis.” It doesn’t say “medical marijuana.” It just says “prescribed substances.” You cannot transport those in your vehicle. His concern is not just that he won’t be able to go to a legal dispensary and pick up his medication, but does that mean that you and I can’t go to our pharmacy and pick up the prescriptions that our doctor has prescribed for us? This is a question he has, and yet we’re not going to get it answered here because the government wants to shut down debate. I’m not going to have an opportunity to bring forward all of his concerns.", "When it goes to committee, if they limit committee, if they limit the amount of time people can actually put their name forward—we’ve seen it many times before, where it’s a very truncated process; there is very little time. By the time the government makes the decision of when people can actually put their names forward—that can happen in days; sometimes not even days, sometimes hours. It gets out to the public and they only have a very limited time to actually put their name forward. So that information isn’t really out there broadly, and by the time people see that they can present, the window of opportunity has already closed. So people like John and others who have concerns about this bill won’t have an opportunity to come to committee and actually ask their government the questions that they have.", "The other questions that have come out of my riding of Windsor West and the broader Windsor area are around the announcement that we will have a dispensary. The elected representatives in Windsor—the city councillors, the mayors and the council members in surrounding municipalities—weren’t really talked to about this; they weren’t really consulted about this. They didn’t know we were going to have a dispensary. They don’t know what it’s going to look like or where it’s going to be. How many dispensaries are we going to have? What is the delivery of that service going to really look like? People in my riding want to know. When we’re talking about cannabis dispensaries, what is taxation going to look like on this cannabis that’s being dispensed through these dispensaries? They want to know. How do you get chosen to work? What’s the screening process to work in one of these dispensaries? Again, they want to know. How many are we going to have and where are they going to be located?", "Without proper consultation with the elected representatives in a municipality, it really is a slap in the face to those that were elected to represent that particular municipality. It’s a slap in the face of the democratically elected city councillors, mayors, MPPs and MPs to not have those discussions, to not give them a heads-up: “Hey, we are looking at your city as possibly having a dispensary.” It’s a slap in the face to not have conversations with those municipalities and say, “Where exactly do you think the best place would be for this dispensary or for multiple dispensaries in your community? What do you think it should look like as we roll these particular dispensaries out?”", "Once again, the government has made sweeping decisions without consultation, and now we find ourselves in a position where they have said their piece but they don’t want to consult with those of us that have been elected to bring the voice of our constituents to this House. This is something we’re seeing far too often. It’s not democratic. To say, “I have said my piece and now I’m going to shut down debate because I don’t want to hear from you”: They may as well put their fingers in their ears and go, “Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah; I’m not listening,” because that’s exactly what has happened.", "We see it far too often. We just went through it yet again with back-to-work legislation. The government drops the ball. They don’t do their part when it comes to having a conversation, those tough conversations, and consulting and finding out how to make things better. They just come in and say, “We are all-knowing; we are all-seeing.” We should call the Liberal government the Wizard of Oz, because they hide behind a curtain, pretend to be something that they’re not.

It’s offensive, it’s disgusting, but you know it’s hardly surprising, as this has been about politics all along for them. It was politics when they failed to support these same measures at committee back in May, and it’s politics today.

They too have done a lot of digging on this file. They’ve gone to their members, the motorists of Ontario, and from what they’re hearing, there is a growing and very serious concern as to what we have in store. While these numbers haven’t been finalized yet during our meetings, the reps were noting that over 75% of those they spoke to were indicating road safety as a serious concern for them once cannabis is legalized, with around two thirds believing that cannabis-impaired driving will, in fact, become more frequent.", "Speaker, that concern seems well warranted when you consider that two in five current marijuana users claim to have driven under the influence. Two in five, or basically 40% of those using marijuana climbing behind the wheel after ingesting cannabis: Those kinds of numbers only further underline the need for those of us in this House to ensure we get it right, to ensure we give these issues the focus and debate they deserve, to ensure the continued safety of motorists right across the province.", "Anyone questioning the need for increased measures need only look south of the border, where the cannabis legalization route has meant increased accidents and further concerns over the impact of drug-impaired driving.", "That’s why we have been calling for the separating out of key sections of this bill to give them the proper consideration they deserve. If you look at the federal government, they have separated Bill C-45 and Bill C-46, the legalization and the Criminal Code aspects of cannabis. New Brunswick: They get it. With their cannabis legislation, in that province, for example, they have five pieces of legislation to deal with the separate aspects of distribution, retail, use, impairment and awareness. That’s the way to do it: Separate the bills to give each aspect the focus and attention it deserves.", "The Liberals should be doing the right thing: Quit the political game-playing and separate out the sections of the bill that have nothing to do with the production/selling of cannabis. But they don’t do the right thing. They don’t. In fact, this is completely the wrong thing, the wrong direction, the move of a dictatorial government that fails to respect the principles our democracy was in fact built on.", "Speaker, again, I can’t express the depths of my frustration that we’re not given the opportunities to discuss these issues, as the Liberals have chosen to silence the debate. It’s completely wrong and it goes against the principles of informed debate on which all legislation should be formed.", "I know I’ll be sharing the rest of our time with my colleague from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock. I want to thank you, Speaker, for my shorter period of time that I had today, but I also want to note how very disappointed I am with what has gone on here. Shame on the Liberals." ],

That bothers me even more: Why are we rushing this? There is no obstruction that is being done by the opposition members. We want to see this bill move forward.

I know I’ve experienced it personally. I have seen it with family members who have gone through so much pain when they are on their last days suffering from cancer treatments and how cannabis can actually enhance and help people retain their foods so that they can get some type of energy and move on.

Why are we not given the opportunity to have a greater discussion about this?", "I know that when I go into my schools and talk to students across this province and engage with them—this is an exciting thing for those children, for different reasons.

But then there are the important issues that you need to deal with: the legalization, the access, the procedures, the dispensary centres. How are you going to tax this? How is that going to help? Where do we go? How do we get it?", "These are all questions that a lot of people have, and they’re giving us two days to figure that one. We’ve had a discussion about this for years, and in two days they’re going to ram this down our throats and, “We think we know best, and we’re going to get it done.”", "When I talk from my place on behalf of the good people of Algoma–Manitoulin—and I wish we would have had more time. I wish I wouldn’t be talking about shutting down debate on this particular piece of legislation, because there are a lot of people who have a lot to offer and a lot to say about this.

I want to give you an example here. I hosted a press conference last week where the Ontario Convenience Stores Association presented a 10-year study showing an alarming and consistent increase in the use of contraband tobacco, which is distributed by organized crime. What that shows us is that the government is failing to protect Ontarians and to control illegal distribution of this unregulated product that is harmful to health and is spreading among our youth. Today, contraband tobacco products are more accessible than ever. The Wynne government has been totally ineffective in enforcing our laws. If they can’t even manage the contraband tobacco issue properly, how can we trust them to properly implement the new cannabis regime?", "That was brought out quite clearly in the press conference. They’ve seen an increase in contraband use. They don’t know what chemical products are in those cigarettes that are made somewhere and then sold—and I know that, in all our communities in Ontario, there’s somebody’s trunk that’s open and they’re selling contraband tobacco, which is not regulated with guidelines, as I said—the chemicals that are in it.

The increase in smoking in young people is increasing.", "If they won’t deal with that major issue—and that’s a huge issue for tax revenues and it’s a huge issue for convenience stores’ viability. Seven stores a week are closing. It is horrific. I have been here speaking about this for over 10 years, and still this government has not done appropriate management of contraband tobacco. They even gave the example of the province of Quebec and what they are doing and what a difference that has made. Again, Mr. Speaker, there are examples out there that this government can follow on contraband tobacco.", "I’m especially troubled, as community safety critic, to hear the warnings from our police forces about their lack of resources to meet the July 2018 deadline for legalization of cannabis. As OPP Deputy Commissioner Rick Barnum recently told a federal committee hearing, “If legislation is ready to go July 2018, policing will not be ready to go August 1. It’s impossible.” I repeat, “It’s impossible.” So why is it that this government insists on pushing forward in such an irresponsible way when our police are so clear in their opposition? As I said, this legislation—the debate started last week, for heaven’s sake. We have hardly had a chance to debate. There are so few members—I have the list: only three of us on the PC side, three on the NDP, five government and one independent have spoken to this massive bill.", "Deputy Commissioner Barnum estimated that the police will need six to eight months from the time the provincial legislation is in place before they’ll be ready to enforce the new laws. He also said that the OPP has only 83 officers who are trained to recognize drug-impaired driving, and estimates they will need up to 500 officers to properly enforce the law. How does the government intend to close this massive gap? You can’t ignore what they’re saying. Are they just going to throw our police services under the bus, as they so often like to do? They so often like to throw the police under the bus, so we see this repeated again.", "They just don’t get how serious the public safety risks are around this approaching deadline. They’re clueless about the resources our police officers will need to tackle drug-impaired driving, which will impose huge new costs on police forces and municipalities.", "Why has the Premier so far been silent on this issue? Why won’t she commit to supporting policing in dealing with this heavy financial burden? The deadline is coming, whether we like it or not, but the least the government could do is to reassure police that they have the funding they need for training and an essential roadside test for impaired driving.", "Unfortunately, this government showed us with Bill 175, the police services act—which is also on the order paper, which I fear they may bring time allocation on also and speed it through—that they simply do not have respect for our front-line police officers. It’s shameful. We shall wait to see next week, because the police services act, although they just introduced it a couple of weeks ago and we just started debate last week—will that be under the same cloud of time allocation—rush debate, rush committee, get it through before the middle of December without listening to the consequences of that bill?", "Another major concern I have in this bill is the lack of public education focused on our youth.

  "text" : [ "I rise today to recognize that this November we are marking the very first official Albanian Heritage Month in Ontario. A year and a half ago, I was honoured to first bring forward a private member’s bill proclaiming November as Albanian Heritage Month in Ontario. I am very grateful to my friend, colleague and parliamentary assistant, the MPP for Etobicoke North, Dr. Shafiq Qaadri, for taking the lead on the bill when I was no longer able to carry it through the legislative process because of my subsequent appointment to cabinet.", "As members may recall, Bill 36, Albanian Heritage Month Act, sponsored by the member for Etobicoke North, was introduced on October 5, 2016. It received unanimous support in the House for its second reading on October 6, 2016, and third and final reading on December 5, 2016. The bill received royal assent on December 8 of the same year.", "I would be remiss if I failed to give special thanks to the strong local Albanian community that worked tirelessly to make this bill a reality; specifically, members of the Albanian Canadian Community Association, including Dr. Ruki Kondaj, the honorary president of the association, as well as the current president, Ramazan Kellezi. Dr. Kondaj, a dedicated, passionate and valuable member of the Albanian Canadian community, has been instrumental in spearheading the community’s efforts of having the bill passed into law.", "This act allows us to recognize and celebrate the accomplishments and contributions of the Albanian Canadian community to Ontario. November is a significant month in their culture and history for a number of reasons. A revolt against the Ottoman Empire, which had occupied this region for more than five centuries, led to a declaration of independence on November 28, 1912. On this day, the Albanian community also celebrates Albanian Flag Day, a unifying symbol of the Albanian nation. Thirty-two years later, in 1944, Albania was liberated from Nazi occupation, and Liberation Day has been celebrated in the country on November 29 ever since.", "Each year, the Albanian Canadian community in Ontario celebrates these occasions by raising the Albanian flag here at Queen’s Park as well as organizing cultural and social festive events throughout the province.", "The community uses these occasions to also celebrate some of the well-known Albanians worldwide. The list is long, but it includes Mother Teresa, who has been proclaimed a Roman Catholic saint. Mother Teresa was born in Macedonia to Kosovo Albanian parents. At the age of 18, she left Macedonia to join the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland to learn English. She made the eventual journey to India, where she devoted her lifelong career to the care of the poor, the ill and the disadvantaged. In 1979, Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work. Today she is considered an Albanian heroine and a unifying symbol of Albanian multi-faith identity.", "Another Albanian hero is Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg, the national hero who unified the nation in the 15th century in its resistance against the early days of the Ottoman Empire.", "Other well-known Albanians include names such as Jim and John Belushi, American-Albanian Hollywood actors and comedians; Rita Ora and Dua Lipa, internationally known singers; Tie Domi, retired Canadian NHL ice hockey player; and last but not least, Inva Mula, a world-famous soprano, who performed at the Albanian Heritage Month reception here at Queen’s Park last night, where I had the honour to join many members of the community to jointly celebrate this important month.", "Albanian Canadians have been part of Ontario life for more than a century. Their community is represented from different parts of southeast Europe, where Albanians have inhabited for centuries, namely Albania proper, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Greece.", "Italy, the country of my birth, has had an Albanian historical minority of a quarter of a million, scattered mostly across southern Italy. The historical Albanian community in Italy, who settled between the 15th and the 16th centuries, are known as Arbëreshë. The Arbëreshë have preserved their authentic language, religion, traditions, customs and art. I have had the opportunity to meet a number of Arbëreshë over the past several years.", "Here in Canada, according to the latest statistics, there are just over 36,000 Canadians who claim Albanian origins. The first wave of immigration arrived in the early 20th century due to internal uprisings that occurred in the Balkan region due to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The second wave of Albanians arrived from the former Yugoslavia during the Cold War, and settled in Toronto and Montreal.", "However, the biggest wave occurred as result of the collapse of the communist regime in 1992 and of the 1990s ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The government of Canada established a residency program to accept 7,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees fleeing the Kosovo conflict in 1998-99.", "Today, the majority of Albanian Canadians reside in large municipalities, including the greater Toronto area, Hamilton, Kitchener, London, Ottawa, Peterborough and Windsor.", "All in all, the Albanian community is integrated successfully and is a part of the diversity in which we all take pride. Members of the community can count on several cultural and community associations for support and networking opportunities.", "Just last month, I had the pleasure of attending a gala fundraiser in support of Albanian House, a new project which, when completed, will be a terrific resource for all members of the community.", "I have also had the pleasure of attending and was honoured with an award from the Albanian Canadian Excellence—or ACE—Society, a group whose mission is to promote excellence and recognize it within the Albanian professional community and to create and sustain the culture for its achievement.", "Speaker, when I look at Ontario’s Albanian community, I see why and how our province has been built on immigration. I see people who have come here and have settled into communities where their neighbours have shared experiences and perhaps similar backgrounds, but I also see people who embrace the chance to get to know and work and live among people with completely different experiences and who come from entirely different backgrounds. I am personally aware of what our province can offer immigrants who come here looking for a better life, and I’m also acutely aware of what newcomers can offer us in the way of culture, industry, community and citizenship, in the very best sense of the word.", "Our province honours history and celebrates diversity. Albanian Canadians are a valued part of that. I am therefore very pleased to acknowledge Albanian Heritage Month here in the province of Ontario." ],

This is Ontario’s first official recognition of Hindu Heritage Month, which was introduced in 2016 by the member for Ajax–Pickering. It is an important recognition of the remarkable contributions made by members of the Hindu community in Ontario. In fact, Speaker, I was glad to speak a year ago in favour of Bill 52, the Hindu Heritage Month Act. I was pleased when it received overwhelming support from all parties.", "Hindu Heritage Month is a time for Hindu families in our province to celebrate their culture, their traditions and their practices, because who we are and where we come from is the force that absolutely drives us forward. But it is also an important time to share and celebrate our culture and traditions with our friends and neighbours. It’s about friendship, unity and understanding. I am delighted that people across Ontario have the opportunity this November and every November to learn about Hinduism, its history and traditions, and the many contributions of Hindus to this province. I was pleased to attend events for Hindu Heritage Month in my riding and here at Queen’s Park, along with many of my colleagues.", "Speaker, here in Ontario we are proud of our diversity. The first Hindu immigrants arrived in this country over 100 years ago. Today, there are close to 500,000 Hindus in all of Canada and a large majority of them live right here in our great province. In fact, more than 360,000 Hindus call Ontario their home. They have raised their families here, contributed to their communities here and helped to build this province up.", "Ontarians of Hindu descent have made remarkable contributions in a wide range of fields, from science and education to politics and business to arts and sports. Hindu Heritage Month gives all of us an opportunity to recognize the significant contributions Hindus have made to Ontario society. Hindus have helped to foster Ontario’s growth and prosperity for generations and I’m proud to stand in this Legislature and say thank you on behalf of the government.", "Speaker, Hinduism is an important part of our diverse province. Hinduism represents a way of life, teaching openness, morality, inclusion and acceptance, all of which reflect the values of Ontario. Hindus take great pride in their culture and traditions and are eager to share them with everyone. In fact, Ontarians of all backgrounds participate in celebrations like Diwali, Navratri and Durga Puja. These festivals take place during the fall or harvest season, which makes this the perfect time of year for Ontarians to celebrate the Hindu community and learn about their long history and rich culture.", "Hindu Heritage Month is also an opportunity to educate generations now and in the future about Hinduism, and further enhance our understanding and appreciation of each other. Speaker, our diversity has made Ontario an absolutely wonderful place to live, work and raise a family. We are a beacon to the world. Of all the Canadian provinces and territories, Ontario welcomes the highest number of newcomers. We know this diversity makes us all stronger.", "As someone whose roots are South Asian and who immigrated to Canada with her family as young girl, I am proud we are celebrating the contributions and achievements of this important community. Multiculturalism brings enormous richness and vibrancy to our province. Hindu Canadians are leaders in our communities, volunteers, friends, co-workers and fellow Ontarians. Hindu Heritage Month is an opportunity to build upon the values of respect and inclusion that define us all.", "I urge all Ontarians to attend events, learn about and celebrate the heritage and cultural contributions of the Hindu community in Ontario." ],

It’s an especially important month for the Albanian community. On November 28, 1912, Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire. On this day, the community also celebrates Albanian Flag Day—of course, a unifying symbol of the Albanian community. On November 29, 1944, Albania was liberated from Nazi Germany, and that anniversary is now known as Albanian Liberation Day. The Albanian Canadian community celebrates those dates in Ontario with many cultural events and by raising the Albanian flag here at Queen’s Park.", "This European country has a very long history. Many may not know that the national Albanian hero is the 15th-century nobleman and soldier Gjergj Kastrioti, known by his nickname Skanderbeg, which is a respectful title invoking Alexander the Great, the Macedonian conqueror who conquered Persia back in the 4th century BC. Skanderbeg unified his country against the encroaching Ottoman Empire, and he successfully repulsed 13 invasions. It was 10 years after his death that the Ottoman Empire managed to conquer Albania.", "Skanderbeg has gone down in history as one of the greatest generals and diplomats of all time. General James Wolfe, whose portrait hangs on the first floor of this building and who commanded the British forces at the Battle of Quebec, called Skanderbeg a commander who “excels all the officers, ancient and modern, in the conduct of a small defensive army.”", "During most of its troubled history, the land of Albania was part of the Eastern Roman Empire and later the Ottoman Empire. Albania is home to both eastern and western Christianity as well as Islam and Judaism.", "There are almost 30,000 Albanian Canadians. The population is growing. Former Toronto Maple Leaf Tie Domi is probably one of the most famous Canadians of Albanian ancestry, but there are others, including Arlind Ferhati, the Albanian soccer player who immigrated to Canada when he was 10; and Ana Golja, who starred in Degrassi: The Next Generation.", "As critic for tourism, culture and sport, I am privileged to salute those fine Canadians, and I’d like to wish everyone a happy Albanian Heritage Month." ],

From business and politics to the arts, science, academics and beyond, Ontario’s Hindu community has left an indelible mark on our society. In doing so, they have made this province a better place to call home.", "Last year, our PC caucus unanimously supported legislation to proclaim November as Hindu Heritage Month. In fact, our caucus held its own Hindu Heritage Month celebration right here at Queen’s Park earlier this month. As our leader, Patrick Brown, noted then, “Over the past two years as leader of the PC Party, I have been honoured to visit temples and mandirs across our great province—meeting new friends and learning more about this ancient faith and the traditions that sustain it.”", "I had the privilege of speaking to the legislation proclaiming Hindu Heritage Month and noted how welcoming the community has been to this MPP from rural, eastern Ontario at special events across the GTA and the province. They have opened their homes, their temples and their hearts, allowing me to better understand their culture and customs.", "One of the great benefits of being an MPP is getting to know the communities that comprise Ontario’s rich cultural fabric. I encourage everyone to join in celebrating Hindu Heritage Month and look for opportunities to learn more about our Hindu neighbours. To the community, I want to give my deepest and most sincere thanks for all you have given our province. I hope that the community enjoys this special month and the recognition that you so richly deserve. Your contributions are another example of why, in Ontario, our diversity doesn’t divide us, but brings us closer together and makes us stronger." ],

Each November marks the anniversary of the Albanian Declaration of Independence, which declared Albania an independent sovereign nation on November 28, 1912.", "As noted in the preamble of this act, “By proclaiming the month of November as Albanian Heritage Month, the province of Ontario recognizes the meaningful contributions immigrants have made in building Ontario’s communities and the social, economic, political and cultural achievements of Albanian Canadians throughout the province. Albanian Heritage Month is an opportunity to remember, celebrate and educate future generations about Ontario’s rich history.”", "Speaker, as I noted earlier, declaring a new heritage month gives Ontarians the important opportunity to learn about the contributions of communities other than their own, and allows us to celebrate the diversity of cultures that make Ontario such an incredible place to call home.", "Thank you to the Albanian community in Ontario and across the country for allowing all of us to celebrate with you today and this month, and I look forward to recognizing and remembering the contributions of the Albanian Canadian community each and every November." ],

I also have to acknowledge the Hindu community in the Durham region, which is more than 12,000 strong and incredibly active as well.", "As I mentioned earlier, the importance of heritage months is the educational opportunity that they provide.

It’s my pleasure to rise today in support of the Ontario PCs’ opposition day motion.", "We often talk about the great accomplishments in public policy in this place, in this Legislature, in this House of our democracy. Admittedly we haven’t done that a lot recently, but I want to acknowledge the work of Adam Beck. His decision over a century ago to offer electricity at cost to the people of Ontario represents one of the great achievements in this House in Ontario’s democracy.", "A century ago, Beck saw a province of farmers, family businesses and industrialists struggling under competitive pressure from the United States. He decided to do something about it. He decided to put the power of Niagara Falls into their hands. Beck’s vision of reliable and affordable hydroelectricity lit this province for half a century until Ontario started putting thermal generating stations and, later, nuclear stations online. Without that vision, Ontario would never have been able to power the mining towns in the north, cars would never have been able to roll off the assembly line in Oshawa and Windsor, and we’d have dark main streets in Kenora and Kitchener.", "At no point in our long tradition in Ontario, our tradition of reliable and affordable power, did we ever say that we’d have bad neighbours. We have always said there are strong ties. Our strong ties meant that we could export or trade power with Quebec, Michigan and New York. What has happened today is unfortunate. Over the last decade, decisions have been made that have tilted the relationship against Ontario. StatsCanada numbers reveal that Ontario exports twice as much power as it did in 2005. Think about that, Mr. Speaker: We export twice as much power as we did in 2005. At a time when Ontarians are running their dishwashers in the middle of the night and pinching their pennies to afford their next hydro bill, this government is getting half as much for exported electricity as it did 12 years ago. Now, I remember asking the Premier in this House why she has become the best minister of economic development that Pennsylvania has ever seen, but that’s the legacy of this government.", "Ontarians have seen triple-digit increases since 2005, but Ontario’s neighbours are paying less and less with each year for the same electricity. We’re charging Ontarians to give it away. And today we found out that not only is Ontario exporting more electricity and getting less money for it; we’re actually losing money in the deal. Ontarians are, in fact, subsidizing Michigan’s ratepayers, Quebec ratepayers and New York ratepayers to the tune of $1.25 billion in the last 21 months. Ontario ratepayers, who are struggling to pay their hydro bills because of this flawed Liberal policy, are subsidizing ratepayers in New York, Michigan and Quebec—absolutely incredible." ],

Where are those jobs going?", "The amazing part about that number is that’s the net cost to Ontario ratepayers. That comes after you factor in what those jurisdictions pay for power. That means that every residential ratepayer in Ontario, every Ontario family, paid $250 on average for the privilege of sending electricity elsewhere. Imagine that: We’re charging the average family $250 that they don’t have. They’re struggling to put food on their table and pay their hydro bill, and we’re charging them $250 to subsidize businesses in other provinces and states? That’s the Liberals’ energy policy. And that’s just since January 2016.", "So when the government gets up and talks about how much money they have made off the sale of exported electricity, we now know that those numbers are not accurate. It’s just tired spin: the same old, same old lines from this tired government. Ontario ratepayers are always working harder to cover the government’s mistakes. Ontario ratepayers are always paying more to cover for this government’s misguided energy policy. And Ontario ratepayers are getting less because of this government’s mistakes. Everyone in Ontario is paying more and they’re getting less. It’s unbelievable.", "Well, our companies are actually being even more damaged. You look at businesses: small businesses in Ontario, large business, industry, manufacturing. They’re all struggling to keep the jobs here. Not only is it a devastating hydro policy that puts families at the brink but it’s killing jobs in our communities. We have mines closing because of this and going to Quebec, like Xstrata copper. We have the next generation of the Chevy Camaro that gets made in Michigan, not Oshawa. New York economic development agencies are putting ads in papers in Brockville and Cornwall to try to get businesses to move across the river.", "Mr. Speaker, despite the government trying to paint a rosy picture, the reality is that today’s numbers from the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers show that politically motivated decisions by this government in our electricity system have helped get Liberal insiders rich off your hydro bills. For years, the government has continued to sign bad contract after bad contract, to the tune of, if you look at these 30 mega contracts the government doled out, these bad contracts, $1.3 million donated to the Ontario Liberal Party.", "On renewable energy, we overpaid by $9.2 billion. They said this was about green energy. We know what it was really about, Mr. Speaker. It was about the Liberal Party coffers. That’s what it was about. Because we are wasting our own green energy: clean, green Ontario water power. You talk about the hypocrisy in that, Mr. Speaker. What I can’t even fathom is that, after borrowing all this money, billions of dollars, up to $93 billion in an unfair hydro plan, now they’re committing the same mistakes again. Now, under FIT 5, they proceded with 390 more contracts. They’re borrowing money for old bad contracts and they keep on signing them. It’s the definition of insanity, Mr. Speaker.", "Even worse, even more shocking, on this flawed energy policy, during the summer, Quebec’s media leaked details of a backroom deal with the Wynne Liberals that they had been negotiating with Hydro-Québec for more energy we don’t need. It would have sent $126 billion to Quebec for power we don’t need while risking thousands of good-paying jobs in the province of Ontario. This is in spite of the fact we’re sitting on a large supply of clean energy.", "I don’t know what the Liberals have against clean, green Ontario hydroelectric generation. Last year, the Wynne Liberals allowed 4.7 terawatt hours of hydroelectric power to be wasted in Ontario. This is the same as powering nearly 500,000 homes. Think about that: They signed bad contracts for energy we don’t need to such an extent that we have to waste our own water power. And not just a little bit: enough to power 500,000 homes. How sad that is, Mr. Speaker.", "They have failed when it comes to energy policy; they have failed to get hydro rates under control. So when I say that the Premier is the best minister of economic development that the northern United States has ever seen, it is based on facts, it is based on evidence, because we are wasting our own water power and charging Ontarians to give it away to our competitors.", "That’s why Ontarians should start getting what they pay for. They should be paying to make life more affordable; they shouldn’t be paying to make life more affordable outside of Ontario. That’s why today the PCs are making a straightforward request to reimburse the ratepayers for money wasted on exporting surplus power. Given the government’s mismanagement on electricity, it seems to be only appropriate and what the ratepayers deserve. So I hope today that the Liberal members in the House, rather than taking their orders from the Premier’s office, will think of all their constituents in their ridings who are struggling with this giant, giant, colossal mistake of Liberal energy policy and think about those constituents in their ridings who can’t afford that $250 to subsidize a business in Michigan.", "It’s time to have reasonable energy policy in the province of Ontario. I hope the Liberal members and every member in this House will support this request." ],

We had that power at cost for many, many years. But, in fact, in 1998, it was actually the PCs, under Minister Jim Wilson, the Minister of Energy, who officially declared that the Adam Beck vision was over, that a new vision for hydro had arrived under Mike Harris. That’s when it all started to unravel. I’m not saying that there weren’t problems, that there were no problems with brownouts and lack of power in those days, but deregulation actually happened under the PCs. Ernie Eves was part of that plan.", "I remember sitting on city council and later on my local hydro board. I remember the millions of dollars of taxes that people in our municipalities actually ended up paying towards this deregulated system that, at the end of the day, never really happened. Probably billions of dollars were actually wasted under that plan.", "The PCs actually had the experience of Alberta under a PC government at the time, under Ralph Klein, who had tried to deregulate a couple of years before their plan went forward. That didn’t work either, and Alberta spent millions and millions of dollars trying to go through that plan. The rate of hydro here went from 4.3 cents to 10.9 cents a kilowatt hour on the first day that the market actually opened. So the Tories then had to back off and had to go back to sending out refund cheques to their constituents and to the taxpayers here in the province of Ontario.", "We have the Liberals now over on that side of the House who now have sold off 60% of our hydro in the province and are borrowing billions of dollars to subsidize a rate decrease that they actually created.", "I wanted to move a bit to the issue of the CEO salary. I think you will remember that during the minority government, it was the NDP who proposed that we put a cap on CEO salaries in this province, on agencies and hospitals and school boards and those kinds of things.", "At the end of the day, under the Tories, we had Eleanor Clitheroe, who was making $2.2 million in, I think, 2001-02, which included her car allowance of $172,000 and vacation pay of $172,000. She also stood to get $6 million in cash if she left Hydro One for any reason. She stood to receive an annual pension of up to $1 million—annual pension.", "Today, we have the Liberals on the other side—their CEO, Mr. Schmidt, is making $4.5 million, but $4.85 million if you add in his perks and benefits, up to 10 times higher than any hydro CEO in the country. That is shameful.", "The Tory government brought in some legislation to clamp down on utility executive salaries, prompting the Hydro One board to resign in protest when they saw the government interfering with Hydro One. The provincial government subsequently appointed a new board of directors.", "What happened to that legislation? If the Tories brought it in and they were capping Hydro CEO salaries, why is it that today the Liberals’ CEO of Hydro here in the province of Ontario is making double what Eleanor made? Nothing seems to have changed; CEOs just keep being paid outrageous salaries.", "After Eleanor was let go—and I think she was compensated quite well. Her agreement was a $33,000 pension a month, which was part of her contract. The government of the day, the Tories, reduced that down to a $24,000-a-month salary—not a year—a month. She took the government to court, I think, in 2008 or 2009. Anyway, the government rolled back her monthly pension to $24,000. At the time that she got that $24,000 a month, the average Hydro employee was only making about $24,000 a year in pension. Today the pension of the average worker in this province in the public sector pension is around $25,000 a year, as opposed to $25,000 a month. A lot of things haven’t changed over the years.", "I want to spend my last minute telling you about one of my local constituents, who is really struggling, unlike Eleanor Clitheroe or Mr. Schmidt. Roger, age 68, a retiree, has been without hydro in his storefront apartment since April 2016. He came into the office looking to get some reconnection. He was cut off for not paying his bill. He doesn’t have enough money to pay his hydro bill. Hydro said that if he came up with $250 pronto, he might qualify for the Niagara Emergency Energy Fund administered through the Hope Centre. The urgency was that the fund was coming to completion/restriction. He would have had to get his bill below $1,500. Unfortunately, we couldn’t reach Roger, because Roger can’t afford a cellphone or a phone service, and so he didn’t meet the time limit.", "Seniors like Roger in my community have been struggling to keep the lights on in communities across Ontario for years because their hydro bills have been skyrocketing under the Liberals’ watch. Ontarians whose financial resources were exhausted long before the Liberals decided to buy votes by mortgaging the future to subsidize hydro bills have had to scramble from agency to agency, hat in hand, trying desperately to get help with a basic need like electricity.", "When the Liberals say, “We’ve reduced hydro rates by 25%”—well, they increased them by 300% before they reduced them by 25%. So in fact, it’s really a minimal reduction, when these poor people who are struggling to put food on the table and pay their rent can’t even get any relief on their hydro.", "I thank you, Speaker.

I’m certain he was not consulted in this. There are far too many errors in this for my friend to have let it go. Let’s just take a couple of them.", "For example, were the PC energy critic actually consulted on this, he would have advised his leader that energy procurement is administered by the Independent Electricity System Operator. It’s completely at arm’s length from the province, and it’s not in any way connected with the government. In fact, Speaker, the Minister of Energy’s office is informed by the IESO which contracts are successful after the proponents have been told.", "Speaker, let’s just continue on this: The premise of the motion by the Leader of the Opposition is that the province ignored expert advice. To the contrary, it was expert advice, consistent policies and progressive ideas that dug Ontario out of the terrible mess left behind by the disgraced Harris-Eves government. Under the watch of that party 10 years ago, executive positions in the old Ontario Hydro and in the Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One entities that succeeded it used to go to Conservative Party hacks who knew nothing about electricity. The truly awful energy policies of that Conservative government from 1995 to 2003 did more than run our electricity system into the ground.", "Let’s remind folks about what the Conservatives did so that they can better understand what they plan to do, because the best predictor of future behaviour is what you did in the past. Even though the Ontario economy during that Conservative government of the 1990s was growing and the population in Ontario rapidly expanding back then, Ontario was, in the 1990s and through the turn of the century, steadily losing the ability to generate electricity—and its price was climbing. Even though the Conservatives cranked up coal-fired generation to a quarter of the total power generated, that could not keep up with the wilful neglect of our nuclear reactors. Indeed, of the eight Pickering reactors, two were shut down so badly on their watch, when electricity decisions were made by political hacks for political reasons, that two of the Pickering reactors could not be restarted and remain shut down today.", "Ontario, despite the clear indicators that renewable energy was the way of the future for every progressive economy, did nothing on the last watch of the Conservative government to make any renewable plans or to implement any form of renewable power on our grid at all. At the turn of the millennium, under a Conservative government, Ontario was a global laggard in renewable energy. Today, Speaker, Ontario is a global leader in clean, economical, renewable energy. This is an important point to make in this debate because this opposition day motion incorrectly asserts that Ontario has an oversupply of electricity at times when power isn’t being used in Ontario. I’ll come back to that.", "But let’s go back to the indicators of wholesale energy incompetence on the watch of the last Conservative government and talk about it, because that will indicate how that incompetence is being projected into the future that the Conservatives envision for Ontario.", "Conservative policies led to brownouts at the turn of the millennium, and Conservative energy policies point Ontario to brownouts in the future if Ontarians vote against their own best interests and believe a single word that Conservatives say on electricity.", "Conservatives tried unsuccessfully to privatize the electricity system in Ontario 10 years ago.

That long-term debt was fully secured by such assets as our nuclear reactors, our power dams, our power lines and other generation, transmission and distribution assets. There was no need to split it off if one had kept the old Ontario Hydro as a single entity.", "In proposing to sell off our electricity assets, the province would, as they had proposed it, completely lose every iota of control over them and the ability to share in their net earnings, unlike this government’s successful plan to take advantage of its equity and transmission without losing control of the company.", "The last PC government dumped more than $20 billion of long-term debt on the taxpayer. It was called the stranded debt. They added a further $1 billion of debt in net purchases of electricity at rates as high as $2 per kilowatt hour for power which was then resold in Ontario at 4.3 cents per kilowatt hour. I guess they thought that with losses like that, they could make it up on volume.", "It led to brownouts between 1999 and 2003. These brownouts were foreseeable and avoidable. This opposition day motion tells Ontarians to get ready for more Conservative brownouts in the future if they should form a government.", "Just in time, Ontarians tossed them out of office in 2003. The province then moved to fix the system, phase out coal, upgrade generation and transmission, phase in renewables, refurbish our Candu nuclear reactors, and better connect to our neighbouring jurisdictions in the years that followed.", "This nuthead resolution accuses Ontario of having—I will use his exact words—“an oversupply of electricity at times when the power isn’t being used in Ontario.” Really? They can’t be serious. Every electrical utility must plan to have on hand the capacity to generate or have available enough electricity to meet its peak demand. This means that during off-peak times, when the electricity grid does not demand as much as when it is at its peak demand time, every single power system in existence will, by definition, have an oversupply of generation capacity available.", "Today, November 21, for example, Ontario’s peak demand is projected to be about 18,000 megawatts. This peak demand normally occurs between midday and late afternoon. That means, unless there is to be a good old-fashioned Conservative brownout in Ontario, our nuclear reactors, power dams, renewable sources, gas plants and imports must be able to deliver that 18,000 megawatts of electricity to Ontario industries and commercial, institutional and residential consumers from midday to about late afternoon.", "Today, November 21, during our peak demand period, Ontario is projected to have available some 10,000 megawatts of nuclear capacity, 2,800 megawatts of wind, 3,800 megawatts of hydroelectric, 125 megawatts of solar, 270 megawatts of natural gas and 27 megawatts of biofuel. On a continuing basis throughout today, Ontario will import about 239 megawatts of electricity and export about 2,400 megawatts of power on an hourly basis.", "After dinner hour, when industrial, commercial and institutional electricity demand in Ontario is lower, Ontario will have surplus power and the Independent Electricity System Operator will have customers waiting to buy it from evening to tomorrow morning.", "During the summer, when air conditioning runs flat out in Ontario, that peak power demand can run as high as 24,000 megawatts. That means that unless you want Conservative-style brownouts, Ontario must be able to generate or buy that amount of electricity to meet our in-province demands.", "That’s why the Conservatives have no credibility on electricity: Because they can’t count. If you can generate enough power to meet your peak demand, you will have some surplus at other times. If you can’t generate enough electricity to meet your peak demand, you will have a brownout or a power blackout. If you agree with what the Conservatives want you to do in this motion, you’d better be prepared to do without electricity at the very moment when you need it most: in the peak of summer or in the middle of the day.", "We need to have enough electricity generation and transmission capacity to meet our peak power demand on a daily and seasonal basis. That means doing the correct, the prudent, the responsible and the right thing will give rise to what this motion calls an “oversupply of electricity” at other times and in the fall, winter and spring of the year in Ontario.", "Our Ontario grid connects to the provinces of Quebec and Manitoba and to the states of New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Minnesota at 26 points along Ontario’s border with those provinces and states. These points are where Ontario exchanges electricity with neighbouring jurisdictions. They are called, in electricity-speak, interties. From these 26 intertie points, we exchange electricity with our neighbours.", "Morning at the Independent Electricity System Operator offices in Mississauga consists of planning for what they know Ontario will need in a day; looking at what our neighbours might need, what we know our neighbours will need; what the weather patterns are; what generation stations or transmission lines are under construction or repair; and what prudent reserves are needed in case the unexpected happens, because without those prudent reserves, you have a brownout.", "Our people and their counterparts in Quebec, New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Manitoba are in touch on a continuing basis through the Independent Electricity System Operator. They do the same thing in all of those other areas. If a power line goes down in Michigan, they might need Ontario power to maintain service to their customers. If the wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t shining in Ontario, we may need to make a choice between firing up a natural gas plant or importing electricity from one of our neighbours.", "Utilities buy power from one another many times during the day. At off-peak times in the spring and the fall, Ontario may have surplus power for a period of minutes or hours. If a neighbouring utility needs it for such a short time, they may be able to procure it either cheaply or even for free. Similarly, if a neighbouring utility needs power from Ontario for an extended period of time, perhaps because of a shutdown at one of their generating stations, they will contract for the power for a fee.", "The question is not, as this nuthead resolution asserts, whether Ontario exports electricity to Michigan and New York at prices that are less than what Ontario ratepayers are paying for the same power, but whether, over a full year, when all the many thousands of transactions are reconciled, Ontario made a net surplus or a net loss. Every jurisdiction exchanges some electricity on a short-term basis at rates higher or lower than the base price paid in their jurisdiction. That traffic goes both ways, and New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Minnesota send surplus power to Ontario at a loss too.", "Ontario Conservatives know all about losing money on electricity imports. They lost billions between 1995 and 2003. Ontario Liberals, by contrast, know all about making a net surplus. Each year, Ontario earns a net surplus of between a quarter of a billion and a third of a billion dollars in net sales of electricity to our neighbouring jurisdictions through these 26 intertie points.", "In energy, as in our economy and in our population, Ontario is the elephant in the room in the Great Lakes basin. Ontario has implemented forward-looking policies which continue to save electricity consumers money and make better use of our assets and those of our neighbours.", "Let’s look at an idea that our government implemented that a Conservative government never tried. Ontario’s season of peak demand is in the summer; Quebec’s peak demand occurs in the winter. For the last few years, Ontario and Quebec have both benefited from a bilateral power transfer guarantee agreement that sees each province reserve 500 megawatts of generating capacity for the other at the same price during their complementary periods of peak demand. That means that Ontario uses its generation and transmission assets to assist Quebec in the winter, and Quebec does the same for Ontario in the summer. This saves the taxpayers and ratepayers in both provinces the expense of building generation capacity that neither needs because the other has it available at their time of peak demand. If you believe the nonsense in this Conservative opposition day motion, they would not want Ontario to earn money by using assets it has in reserve in the winter—rubbish.", "The third and fourth senseless clauses in this Conservative opposition day motion deal with the cost to produce emissions-free electricity and seem to suggest that carbon-free electricity is a luxury. Try telling that to the generation of students who now go to school without about one in six needing puffers. Try selling that baloney to seniors who are still alive because the air over the GTA and other Ontario cities is now clean year-round.", "In fact, with the benefit of nearly seven years of experience since coal went offline in the GTA, we now know that emissions-free electricity saves the health system some $4.5 billion per year. We in Ontario save $4.5 billion each year, earn money by selling our surplus power, and have already arrived at a clean-power future to which every other North American jurisdiction aspires and, as yet, none other than Ontario has attained. Of course, had the Conservatives continued to govern Ontario after 2003, we would not be there either, and electricity costs would already be higher than they are now and headed for the roof in the future.", "Let’s look at our neighbouring jurisdictions and see how their electricity production plans stack up with Ontario’s. Our geographic bookends, Quebec and Manitoba, have economies and populations that are not growing anywhere near as fast as Ontario, an industrial base not as power-intensive, and both are blessed with surplus hydroelectric power. Both of these provinces have deliberately done exactly what this nuthead Conservative motion advocates against: develop the ability to produce surplus electricity so they can sell that power at a profit to their neighbours.", "It’s different in the surrounding US states. They’re going to lose all of their nuclear capacity. Their light-water reactors are Pickering vintage, designed in the 1950s and built from the 1960s through the 1970s. Though it is technically feasible for the US to refurbish them, it’s not the best use of American utility funds, and as they reach the end of their service lifetimes, they’ll be decommissioned. None of the other Great Lakes states has plans to replace their nuclear reactors.", "Our Great Lakes neighbouring states will lose all their coal-generating capacity. Utilities in the Great Lakes basin in the United States are not building new coal plants. Those in service will gradually be decommissioned as they reach the end of their service lifetimes.", "States vary in their commitment to implementing renewable electricity. Like Ontario, there is very little potential for adding additional hydroelectric capacity. The Great Lakes basin states are nowhere near as far along as Ontario is in deploying and integrating renewable energy into the grid.", "In the USA, the power grids, in many cases, desperately need the renewal that has happened here in Ontario in the past decade and a half. That means that even if the states to which Ontario profitably sells electricity chose to be more aggressive in their adoption of wind and solar—mostly wind—their grids are not yet properly configured to get power from where it’s produced to where it’s needed, and the public utility commissions in the various states have not allowed utilities to raise rates so that they can invest in the capital improvements that they so desperately need.", "To put this another way, in the last dozen or so years, Ontario bought tomorrow’s power system, paid for it with yesterday’s money and financed it over its lifetime at interest rates close to zero. In America, they have the opposite challenge: They must play catch-up, thus buying today’s power system, paying for it with tomorrow’s money—meaning a higher price—and financing it over its lifetime at interest rates that are already rising. This Conservative opposition day motion wants Ontario to be where the United States is headed. Your government has invested yesterday to secure your electricity future through many tomorrows.", "From 2013 to 2015, the net surplus to Ontario electricity ratepayers from trading with the United States was $850 million. That money helped pay for improvements in Ontario’s electricity system and hold down rates. In the years to come, American electrical utilities will be eager customers for Ontario electricity. In Ontario, we connect to more US states than any other province. With a new intertie nearing completion underneath Lake Erie, on the lakebed, Ontario will be able to sell even more power to Michigan, yielding even more profitable export revenue for the province, its people and its electricity ratepayers.", "We on this side of the House call upon the Conservative Party to reimburse Ontario ratepayers for the costs of the ideologically driven—and truly stupid and unsuccessful—policies that they enacted while in government. Those errors cost the province a decade of time to fix. Now we in Ontario deal from a position of strength in having the capacity to meet our own power demands and to earn a predictable profit stream for many years to come, selling electricity to our neighbours, many of whom will need much more than what they’re buying today as the North American economy grows.", "I reject this opposition day motion for being the politically motivated nonsense it is, for being nothing more than Conservative pre-campaign talking points, without any basis in fact, in business or in science.

So $1.25 billion, in the last 21 months—that’s just since January 2016.", "The energy minister actually used the phrase “net” in his answer this morning, as though he was trying to explain how this government has managed to put this province in such a ridiculous oversupply situation that we’re losing over a billion dollars in less than two years by selling electricity. All that means is that the minister either misspoke or he doesn’t know what the word “net” actually means.", "After question period, my office spoke with representatives from the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers—the experts—and it turns out that, as they were doing their calculations on this matter, they actually had former officials from the system operator verifying their numbers for them. Now, I know that it’s common for this government to ignore the experts—they’ve done it already again this afternoon. That’s how we got into this mess in the first place. But it went to a whole new level today.", "The Ontario Society of Professional Engineers estimated that this power is being sold on the export market at less than two cents per kilowatt hour in a lot of cases—less than two cents. Just using the Ontario Energy Board’s figures that were included in the Financial Accountability Officer’s report that came out this morning, nuclear is at about 6.9 cents per kilowatt hour; hydroelectricity is 5.8 cents per kilowatt hour; wind comes in at 17 cents per kilowatt hour; natural gas at about 20 cents; and solar at about 48 cents because, remember, there are those 80-cent-per-kilowatt-hour contracts that are out there.", "The simplest definition of net revenue is profit after cost. If it’s costing us anywhere between 5.8 cents and 48 cents to produce the power, then there’s no net revenue. Someone is covering the cost to produce, and that cost to produce isn’t being recovered by the revenue gained from the sale. So yes, we’re losing money. There’s no doubt that we’re losing money on the export of power, but the biggest question is why.", "This morning, the minister pretended that it was because of the dispatching model that the IESO uses to determine what does and doesn’t go on the grid, and he pretended that the opposition was arguing for more expensive sources of electricity, which is demonstrably false. While the overall hydroelectric price, according to the OEB, is 5.8 cents per kilowatt hour, the price for Ontario Power Generation’s hydroelectric fleet comes in at 4.4 cents on average. That makes it some of the cheapest power in the province, if not the cheapest power in Ontario." ],

The reason that is is because that’s when electricity demand in Ontario is the lowest: in the spring, in the fall and at night. Typically at those times, the load in Ontario is so low that it can largely be serviced by hydroelectricity and nuclear: our hydro facilities, our water power dams and our nuclear plants.", "The problem occurs because those are also the times of year that the wind wants to blow. Now, because you don’t control the fuel source with wind power, you don’t get to control when it runs. The extent of your control is the ability to shut it off when it runs and you don’t want it to, so you end up exporting or curtailing power.

They have raised this concern numerous times through emails, phone calls, at town hall meetings that I have held about the ridiculousness of the province paying other jurisdictions to take our oversupply of electricity. However, we see before us in this motion no mention of the fact that much of this oversupply is the result of fixed contracts—fixed private sector contracts—that have been signed with electricity generators, that we are locked into with prices that we have no control over. And that, Speaker, is because this Conservative government thought that privatizing electricity generation was a good idea. They’re the ones who broke up the old Ontario Hydro and decided to hive off electricity generation to OPG, and what we have seen in the aftermath of that is a proliferation, an explosion, of private sector contracts that are signed to guarantee profits to private sector generators.", "This PC Party believes that the solution to this problem is simply to reimburse Ontario ratepayers. We on this side of the House, within the Ontario NDP caucus, believe that the solution to this problem is to fix the problem. That’s why the Ontario NDP have brought in a comprehensive plan to cut hydro prices. We brought that plan in many months ago. The plan addresses oversupply, among other things, but the centrepiece of that plan really is to return Hydro One to public hands. We know that this was a decision to privatize and that, really, the Conservatives wanted to go in that direction. They wanted to privatize transmission, but they lost their nerve. So they’ve left it to the Liberals to complete that privatization of the electricity system with the sell-off of Hydro One, which they did not mention anywhere in their platform back in 2014, that this was what they were planning to do. They weren’t up front with the taxpayers, the citizens, the voters of this province that if they elected the Liberal government, they would end up privatizing our most valuable public asset, a public asset that means so much to the people of this province, to the businesses of this province. They went ahead and decided to sell off that public utility that we really rely on to further the public interest.", "Instead of using electricity to advance the public interest, what we are seeing is that shareholder profits have now become the highest priority for operational decisions of this privatized utility, and that’s why we’re currently in the midst of another request for a rate increase. Hydro One is looking out for the best interests of the shareholders, and that is what it’s supposed to do as a private sector corporation, but we believe that the citizens of this province should be the priority for decisions around how we’re going to operate our electricity system. That is why the NDP has brought forward our plan to cut hydro prices.", "Speaker, it’s interesting: For months people have asked the PCs, “What exactly is your plan?” We haven’t seen anything about how the PCs are proposing to address some of these challenges in Ontario’s energy system. We had a heads-up about the policy discussions they’re going to be having this weekend, and nowhere in those documents is there any reference to some kind of comprehensive plan as to how they’re going to deal with Ontario’s energy challenges.", "Instead we see this motion today, which I guess helps differentiate the PCs from the Liberals, because we did hear last month, in fact, that the PCs are going to go full steam ahead with the energy plan that the Liberals have put forward, which is going to cost the citizens of this province $40 billion over 30 years in interest costs.", "I’ve heard the Liberals talk about, “Oh, it’s just like refinancing a mortgage.” Well, Speaker, it’s not refinancing a mortgage. At least when you refinance a mortgage, you have a house at the end of it. With what the Liberals have proposed, it’s simply shifting the costs of financing the mismanagement of our hydro system onto future generations. And we recently heard that the Liberals paid $4 billion additionally to do that shifting of the cost, to do the accounting that would enable them to shift those costs, and they were quite willing to impose those costs on the people of this province.", "Speaker, we have a big challenge in this province with poverty.

The median household income in the rest of Canada has risen almost 11% over that decade. We in London are struggling. We are struggling with issues around poverty, around the number of people who are living on low income, around the number of children who are living in low income. Almost one quarter of all of the children who live in the London CMA are living in low-income homes. That is a completely unacceptable rate of child poverty when you think about what that means for families and for these children who want to get the best start in life.", "I wanted to share with you some of the stories that have been brought to my attention by Londoners who are struggling with poverty and low incomes. Marissa Humphrey shared her story with CBC London in September. She said that she’s trying to live on an income of less than $30,000. She says that housing is a major concern. She says that in the winter she tries not to turn on the heat to save on electricity because that is the only way that Marissa Humphrey can make ends meet.", "Another Londoner, Becky, shared her story. She lost her job. She ended up on Ontario Works. She gets a housing benefit from Ontario Works of $495 and is forced to pay rent of $775 because that is the going rate for rent in London. She said that out of her savings and her Ontario Works benefits, she has to pay for gas, hydro, phone and the Internet. And she asks a very valid question. She asks, “How are you supposed to do better for yourself when you can’t even have a house, when you can’t even make your rent and hydro rates are so insane?”", "Speaker, the mismanagement of our hydro system by this Liberal government has created incredible hardship for people in my community. I want to share the story of Dianne and Travis Rump, who came to my office just a couple of weeks ago, at the end of October. Dianne was injured at work, was no longer able to do her job, and went on ODSP. They have six children. They are struggling to pay high hydro bills in the home that they rent. As a result, they have had their hydro cut off several times, and this has a domino effect on the decisions that they make about how they are going to allocate their scarce resources. They have to make decisions about paying rent, paying the hydro bills, or putting food on the table for their six children. Unfortunately, because of the financial pressures that they’ve been facing, they are now in arrears of over $1,000.", "For many, many people in this province, trying to figure out how they’re going to address those arrears as well as keep up in the future with ongoing hydro costs—the challenges appear insurmountable to people like Dianne and Travis and to many other citizens in this province.", "Speaker, I also want to talk about health care. Earlier this month, on November 13, our leader was in London. We shared some horror stories from London Health Sciences Centre about a family who waited in the ER for 16 hours. The brother in the family had attempted suicide. They ended up in the hallway for four days, after waiting in the hallway for 16 hours. Unfortunately, this was not a unique circumstance. This happens regularly in my community of London West.", "At the same time, I want to remind MPPs who are here today that last March the NDP released information about the hydro bill that London Health Sciences Centre is paying. London Health Sciences Centre’s hydro costs went up almost $2 million in the last six years. Between 2010 and 2016, they were able to reduce their hydro usage by 13%; however, they saw their costs increase 29%. The requirement to pay those increasing hydro bills means that the services that are already stretched impossibly thin are pressured even more.", "Speaker, New Democrats believe that we need to make some significant changes to our hydro system. If we are going to address some of these challenges, we need to look at many more things than simply reimbursing Ontario ratepayers the cost incurred by the surplus electricity. We need to look at fixing the problems. We need to look at thoroughly going through, with a fine-tooth comb, all of the bad contracts that have been signed thanks to the PC government that started the privatization of electricity generation. We need to look at whether it makes sense to renegotiate or discontinue some of those contracts or maybe cancel them—but let’s find out the financial costs of cancelling them first.", "We need to bring Hydro One back into public hands. I know that the Conservatives and the Liberal members opposite have heard as much as we have heard on this side of the House from constituents who are opposed to the privatization of Hydro One, who understand that it is a disastrous decision that completely undermines this province’s ability to use our electricity system to advance the public good; to further the public interest; to ensure a stable, reliable source of revenue from a dividend that is generated when electricity is in public hands; and to use those revenues to support schools, to support health care, to support expanding infrastructure, to enhance our transit system—to achieve all of these public goals that we have as a society. But, no, this Liberal government wants to proceed with privatizing Hydro One. We know this Conservative caucus is completely in favour of privatization.

I don’t know if you’ve ever read his book, Speaker; it’s called Public Power: The Fight for Publicly Owned Electricity. The book was published in 2003, and basically it talks about how “deregulating electricity prices and the privatizing publicly owned power system assets has been an economic disaster in North America and elsewhere. Instead of the promised abundance of lower priced power, states and provinces that have embraced deregulation and privatization are now experiencing astonishing price spikes and unexpected shortages. Taking us from the very beginnings of the electricity industry in the 1880s right up to the present day, Howard Hampton vividly recounts the dramatic political struggles between public and private power in both Canada and the United States, a moving story that links Ontario’s Sir Adam Beck, founder of North America’s largest public power system, with Franklin D. Roosevelt, who established the still public New York Power Authority and Tennessee Valley Authority, and Cleveland mayor Dennis Kucinich, who sacrificed his political career rather than sell his city’s municipally owned electric utility.”", "If you’ve ever had any doubt that public power is the way to go, I fully recommend you read this book from Howard Hampton. It will make a lot of things clear.", "But we don’t have public power in Ontario anymore. We all know that it all started with a Conservative government. The Conservatives did what Conservatives do: They privatized. They started privatizing the production of our electricity. At the time, the Liberals—the Liberals were in opposition with us in the NDP—sort of supported progressives and argued strongly against the privatization of our electricity system, calling it a “vital public asset,” very much using the words and the idea that the NDP is still supporting, that our electricity system belongs in public hands.", "Then they got elected; then they got into power. Although they had spoken quite eloquently about the need to remain in public hands, they privatized. But they won’t even say it out loud.

To kick the can down the road, to borrow billions of dollars and to incur tens of billions of dollars in interest and make this a problem for the next generation. On top of that, American states are advertising to Ontario companies to relocate their businesses south of the border, and to do so, they offer cheaper electricity as an incentive.

Speaker, that’s just not right.", "Everyone in the PC caucus knows this, and we hope that everyone on all sides passes this motion and gives Ontarians the true relief they need. Now that is the fair thing to do.", "I was kind of taken aback this morning. The energy minister had the gall to call our position political spin. But I ask, if we truly got our electricity at the cheapest cost at the cheapest time, then why on earth have our hydro rates skyrocketed? Maybe it’s because we have built too much generation capacity. So maybe it’s actually the Minister of Energy who is guilty of spin.", "For instance, if I bought six cars but only drove the car with the cheapest fuel or the best fuel economy every day, that doesn’t change the fact that I still bought five cars that I didn’t need. Meanwhile, because I have extra cars on hand, my neighbour is really happy because I let him use one of my cars at a loss. That’s what’s happening with our energy today in Ontario. Sadly, in Ontario’s case, it wasn’t too many cars that we bought; I have to suggest to you that it was too many industrial wind turbines forced on unwilling communities.", "In my riding, the great riding of Huron–Bruce, the cost is not only $1.25 billion per year in wasted energy going to the States, but it’s also the altered landscape and the health impacts that have plagued the residents of my riding. This government still has not brought forward sufficient regulations for setbacks or for infrasound testing. Based on the lack of action we have seen, it looks like the Premier has not admitted or accepted any of this, or, worse, she just chooses not to care.", "Again, Speaker, I would like to remind the Premier that the cost for the Liberal green energy boondoggle is not just hundreds of millions of dollars. There is also a human cost, like the health impacts being felt throughout my riding. Families have felt a very real human cost from these industrial wind turbines, and the Premier and this Liberal government should not only reimburse the ratepayers for their mistakes; they should also be doing everything in their power to mitigate health concerns." ],

Therefore, this debate comes a little bit after having been here for a year and having had the opportunity, because it has been an important issue for Ontarians, to dig into this energy file. I’m also very pleased that for the last three weeks or so, I have been appointed PA to the Minister of Energy, so I had the opportunity again to go deeper into this file.", "The first thing I want to say, évidemment, is that we care. I think the idea that there is an absence of caring here does not reflect at all the values on this side of the House. We brought in a 25% reduction on energy bills that applies to everyone. We also expanded all the programs that allow businesses and individuals to access and pay their bills more easily.", "Je veux aussi parler un peu de—c’est assez fascinant de lire cette motion qui ne cite qu’une partie de l’agenda de la société des ingénieurs.", "I had the opportunity to read what the professional engineers said this morning, and I think it’s important to put their comments in context. They are inviting a new innovation, which is the interruptible retail electricity market, to use some of Ontario’s surplus clean energy. In a way, they are participating in the great program that the LTEP is allowing, which is inviting technological innovation to reduce costs throughout the system. The second part that I think is important to note in the society of professional engineers quote is that they say it is imperative to depoliticize the debate.", "I think it’s very important that Ontarians understand well how the electricity system works and what the investments that were made in the electricity system have meant for Ontario. I won’t repeat all of the good explanations that my colleague from Mississauga–Streetsville has given, but I will explain a little bit more succinctly exactly what’s going on.", "We had to invest in the system. The system was crumbling. You have a choice: You can choose to invest in coal, or you can decide you’re not going to invest in coal and then you can decide to remove coal. The investment to reduce and to eliminate coal from the energy supply is something that all Ontarians should be very proud of. It was the right thing to do, and it also has allowed some significant reduction in our health costs. There are no more smog days. That’s an important aspect of the better Ontario that we live in.", "The second part that was important to do for the system was to make it more reliable. I hear that it may not be perfect everywhere in Ontario, but certainly we have seen a reduction of the widespread blackouts and brownouts. A brownout is when a company decides to undercut and stop its operation because it fears that it won’t have enough electricity to carry it out. That’s a real cost to our productivity. So the importance of having a reliable system cannot be underestimated.", "Finally, I think it’s important—and this is where I wanted to go: I want to continue to work toward a more affordable system. For the next four years, we know that the rates have been fixed and they won’t increase. They have decreased by 25%, and they won’t increase by more than the rate of inflation. That gives us time to continue to look at reducing the costs in the system.", "That brings me to some of the very good innovations that are being put forth in the long-term energy plan. I had the privilege of attending the release of the plan and to hear people talking about what it meant for Ontario. This plan has legitimacy and has credibility because it is the result not only of long studies but also of in-depth consultation with all facets of the sector.", "Let’s summarize a little bit now what reliability means for our system. Reliability means that you have to have the capacity to respond to peak demand, not just average demand. You have to have the capacity to respond when everybody is turning on their oven, when all industries are out there wanting to use energy. It’s very important. It’s the responsibility of the government to ensure that you have the capacity within the system to respond to peak demand. This, I think, was the incentive and the imperative that we were trying to do.", "All jurisdictions import and export. They all do it to satisfy their needs. Ontario is no different than the others. What we have, though, is that now we are not solely an importer of energy, and that’s a good thing. We don’t want to be solely an importer of energy because then you’re at the mercy of other jurisdictions changing their price plan, changing their priorities, and trying to extract a higher cost from you.", "In a way, having decided to invest in a system to have greater capacity to meet peak demand is crucial for the Ontario economy. I’m actually very proud that we are in that position right now. Now, if we continue to ensure these investments in the grid and in the electricity system, it has been very worthwhile. We want to continue to be in that position to actually respond to our demand.", "The long-term energy plan that was released recently provides an array of options. It is entitled Delivering Fairness and Choice because it does aim to provide more choices to the consumer. It’s an exciting time in the energy sector because there is so much technological innovation. We have to be in a position to leverage these technological innovations, and I believe that it’s only by having a plan that you actually can leverage technological innovation. If you don’t have a plan, you don’t know what’s going on and you can’t move forward. The ability to have a plan that looks at what the demand could look like in 20 or 30 years is important to all of us.", "I am very pleased to have in front of me an assessment of what could possibly be the demands of the Ontario sector, the Ontario economy for the next little while. There are some uncertainties. We don’t know how fast some electrification could take place. We don’t know how much, either. Indeed, there could be some people going off the grid. But we know and we assess here that there will probably be some opportunities for new innovations in the system.", "We have decided, and I think that’s a good thing, to be somewhat agnostic as to which sources of energy will be used. We’re going to let the market compete to deliver the best price for consumers. Actually, where we are, I think that’s probably the right thing to do. We’re not going to presume that wind or solar will be better. They are now all able to compete because they now all have the technology to actually deliver something additional to the consumer.", "Let me continue to express how important it is that we recognize the way in which our system has been improved and the way in which we are giving to Ontario’s economy and to Ontarians generally a system that they can be proud of, a system that is clean and that does not rely on coal. It puts us at the forefront of the sustainable environmental efforts across the world. It also puts us at an important juncture where we are able to reduce our emissions. An important aspect of being in Ontario today is to recognize our responsibility toward the environment. I’m very proud that we have decided not to rely on coal anymore.", "I also want to say that I am proud that we have a system that has invested to make sure that there are reliable aspects. In the LTEP, in the long-term energy plan, what I like a lot is that we talk about indigenous partnerships. We talk about extending our transmission lines with the indigenous community to ensure that the northern communities that are not served and that are served by diesel being dropped in to them now can connect with the grid. That’s an important aspect for all Ontarians, but particularly for our responsibility toward indigenous people. I’m proud of the fact that it is done by having them as real partners who will benefit from it, control it, and be partners in the business of it.", "Other aspects that are interesting in the long-term energy plan refer to the consumer choices that are being allowed by the new technology. That, I think, will allow all of us probably to get out of time-of-use and make better choices that correspond to our own values. Not everybody has the same lifestyle. People who live in Toronto and maybe work all day and arrive very late at night won’t have the same needs as somebody who lives in her house and wants to watch TV all day or do other things—do her washing and so on—and many shift workers as well. So it’s important to create more flexibility in the system for the consumer, and I think that’s what the long-term energy plan aims to deliver. I think that’s an important step, and I’m very happy that we have done that.", "Another aspect that I think is particularly important for our energy is the idea that we want to continue to protect consumers. The Ontario Energy Board, which is the authority responsible for assessing rates and for delivering and framing the debate, ensuring that the interests of consumers are kept at the top of mind, will be empowered to continue to do its good work, and I think that’s very important for consumers all over Ontario.", "I think the objective, certainly, that we have is that we want to protect consumers and ensure that they have access to reliable and green energy. I think this is particularly important to the Ontario economy because it is also a commitment to our sustainable environment. I think we know on this side of the House that it’s important to ensure that all Ontarians are able to participate in the economy. We want to create not only the ability for them to participate by having access to education and by having a fair wage, but also by ensuring that, indeed, they can have access to clean, reliable energy to do whatever they are wanting to do, whatever they desire to do, and whatever it is their ability to do." ],

I have to say, Speaker, that if I were to jump to the end of the story, it would be to reiterate the story we heard from a couple of the greenhouse operators in your own area when we toured there together. The greenhouse operators talked about the fact that they needed to double the size of their operations, and you wonder what that means in terms. These are massive greenhouses that grow fruits and vegetables all year long. We met up with them, but they couldn’t get a good power deal from the province of Ontario.", "A couple years later, we met up with them at the vegetable growers’ lobby day here at Queen’s Park, and I asked one of them, “Last time we saw each other a couple of years ago, you talked about the fact that you were going to double the size of your greenhouse. Did you ever do it?” And of course the answer was, “Well, yes, I did. In fact, we spent $100 million”—so now we know the scope of what they were talking about—“doubling the size of our greenhouse, but we did it in Ohio.” That is just fascinating, that they could not get power at a price they could afford in Ontario, so they go to do it in Ohio, where—think about it, Speaker—as we now know, we pay Ohio to take our surplus power, and they come and eat our lunch and steal our manufacturers. That’s the bizarre side of all of this.", "I was reading Niagara This Week, and I had to chuckle at the last couple of sentences. It was the energy minister bragging about how great a job he has done here in Ontario. He says, “By investing billions into modernizing its hydro system ... Ontario ... now has an energy system that’s reliable and clean.” That is what our minister said. “‘We are the jurisdiction that led the way,’ said Thibeault. ‘Everybody else is trying to figure out how to do it. We’ve already done it.’”", "Well, Speaker, I had to chuckle, because I know the Premier and this minister said that they spent $35 billion—one of them said $35 billion, and the other said $50 billion; they can’t agree on how much they spent—on modernizing the system. Let me tell you what they actually spent that money on. I’ll call chapter one “frills and shiny baubles.” They spent $2 billion on smart meters that we know don’t work. They spent $1.2 billion on a smart grid. They spent $600 million on the coal plant write-off—that’s before they got back into coal in the States—two and a half billion dollars on conservation and $1.1 billion on cancelling the gas plants. That’s about $7.4 billion of the money that they said was to build up their system. So far, none of that has done anything to build up the system, and we’re only at $7 billion now.", "We call it unreliable and intermittent power. They spent $10.2 billion on wind generation, $5.2 billion on solar generation and $5 billion for transmission to get power connections for those far-flung wind and solar projects to bring the power to where it’s needed. When the minister says we spent billions modernizing the hydro system, so far, none of this has modernized it. They say they upgraded the transmission system, but it’s kind of a stretch goal. They did spend money on transmission, but not to build a system; this was to bring power from the power lines at the wind and solar projects that are far-flung. That was $20.4 billion. Together, that’s almost $28 billion so far.", "Then, of course, we have their other photo op generation. That’s another $4 billion.", "A good value for money was the Bruce nuclear refurbishment, at $3.4 billion.", "Speaker, this proves that the bulk of the money did not go toward what they say, “the cost of the rebuild.” It went to intermittent and unreliable wind and solar projects, just like the Auditor General—whom they continue to disparage—tells us it did, and they’re unable to deliver generation when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun’s not shining.", "I heard the new parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Energy speak. Here are a couple of facts that probably she should look at and a couple of websites she can go to. I’ve discussed the reliability system many times before.", "I want you to go to Blackout Tracker Annual Report, a very important international system. Blackout Tracker Annual Report revealed the number of Ontario outages increased by 275% from just 2012 to 2015. That’s the time they told us they were fixing this broken system, as they keep saying.", "In the Auditor General’s 2015 annual report, she revealed, “Most of the increase in what consumers pay for electricity has come from generation” costs, which account for 60%. Generation costs increased 74%.", "Again, it’s not to rebuild this system, as they keep saying; it’s to put into their pet projects and their ideological projects.", "What happened? As a direct result of having among the highest all-in electricity rates in North America, we not only have lost businesses in Ontario, two very prominent businesses have not come to Ontario.

They see an opportunity. Where they see criticism, the engineers of this province see an opportunity, an opportunity to use clean, green, surplus power to make carbon-displacing fuels, such as hydrogen—which you can then put into the natural gas system and use for transportation—and transform the manufacturing processes in this province that use methane-generated hydro, which is highly carbon-intensive. This is an opportunity, not a criticism.", "It just demonstrates how little the members of the other side—the official opposition—understand the power generation system in this province. Not only could they not run the power generation system in this province; they couldn’t even run a greengrocer’s.", "Think about the analogy, Speaker. You couldn’t run a greengrocer. The greengrocer puts out a whole bunch of fruits and vegetables to sell to people at the premium price because they’re premium products. But as the day goes on, it’s going to be overnight.

The people in this province have paid and continue to pay a heavy price for poor Liberal policy decisions on the energy file.", "This has taken a new turn in my riding of Lambton–Kent–Middlesex, where, in addition to staggering hydro bills, there is a new price being paid by some families. The government has told them that they are expected to forfeit access to clean, safe well water. Mr. Speaker, 16 families in north Kent are now unable to drink water from their wells, which had produced clean, clear water for decades. This morning, I delivered to the Minister of the Environment a sample of the murky brown dredge that is now being drawn from those same wells since construction of massive turbines began nearby.", "It is time that this government was accountable. The disastrous Liberal and NDP Green Energy Act has done enough damage. They owe my constituents answers about what it’s doing to their drinking water. Construction of turbines should not be allowed to proceed until the government carries out heavy-metal testing and gets a handle on what a full impact of these useless wind farms will be.", "On March 8 of this year, a renewable energy application submission was made to the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change to develop a wind turbine installation along the banks of Otter Creek. Part of this planned industrial wind turbine development will be within one kilometre of suburban streets in Wallaceburg.", "On September 29, 2016, when the Otter Creek project was merely an idea in the mind of its majority off-shore investor, I pointed out to the Minister of Energy that further progress on this project should cease, both for environmental reasons and because there’s no requirement for further renewable energy development.", "There was no discernible reason to move forward. Who does it benefit? Had the minister cancelled the two projects in question—Otter Creek and North Kent 1—by the ministry’s own estimates, the long-term savings would amount to more than $570 million.", "Most of the wind turbines in Lambton–Kent–Middlesex stand 130 metres from the ground to the top of the blade. The proposed towers and blades for Otter Creek will take that height to 195.7 metres, Mr. Speaker. To help you understand, that is the distance from the front steps of the Legislative Building, south past to the limits of Queen’s Park Crescent and further south halfway down to College Street.", "Otter Creek flows through some of the best agricultural land in our country—land which, after the construction of industrial wind turbines, will never again raise an ear of corn or a stem of soy beans. I’m surprised that the Minister of Agriculture raises no objections.", "Otter Creek is an environmentally sensitive area. The area is home to 24 species of fish, mussels and reptiles which are classified nationally or provincially as species at risk. Otter Creek is also a major flyway for migratory birds and waterfowl. I am amazed that the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry raises no objections.", "The Otter Creek industrial wind turbine development will require the foundations of its towers to be supported by steel pilings driven into bedrock. The bedrock in this particular area includes a band of Kettle Point black shale, and it is this band that carries the water of the local aquifer, which fills the water wells for my constituents. There are legitimate concerns and fears that pile driving will cause the water in these wells to become turbid and impotable. I am astounded that the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change and this government are willing to continue jeopardizing the local water supply.", "The government must listen to what we’ve raised here today. There is no need to continue building more wind turbine projects in the province of Ontario. It’s raising issues when it comes to environmental and health concerns for my constituents and further raising the cost of electricity.

I asked the Premier a simple yes-or-no question: “Will the Premier do the right thing and release all of the correspondence that her office had with the SEIU and all other relevant stakeholders ahead of the home care changes announced in October?” Speaker, the answer that I received from the Premier, as you’re well aware, was not satisfactory.", "I asked a very specific question, and I even specified that this question was about ethics, not the merits of the Liberal plan. Yet the Premier continued on and spoke about the merits of her government’s decision to secretly create this new agency. I leave it to the member opposite to please speak to the ethics of this matter and to answer a simple question: Will the government release the details of all the consultations they held prior to announcing that they will create a new secret home-care agency?", "It’s very important to answer this question because, time and time again, the Wynne Liberals have eroded public confidence. Be it from offering cushy green energy contracts to donors to offering appointments to would-be nominees to back out, these Liberals just manage to find ways to break down trust with everyday Ontarians.", "Speaker, it’s about trust. As I said, every day they have given Ontarians a reason to not trust them, and the sad reality is that this government has built up a reputation for rewarding insiders. In this case, the links appear to be much too strong and hit very close to home, and it’s hard to pass these links off as coincidental.", "The fact that former Liberal Party president Mike Spitale is the director of government relations for the SEIU should raise alarm bells across this province. It’s clear that his union stands to benefit the most. To quote a story that appeared on the CBC from Mike Crawley, I would like to share the following: “Some with a more cynical view from inside Ontario’s $50-billion-a-year health care industry say the Liberals are deliberately making this move quietly. They say the biggest beneficiary of a new government-run home care agency will not be the patients receiving home care, but one particular union: SEIU Healthcare.”", "When a journalist publishes such a scathing report, we should all realize that something just doesn’t pass the smell test. But on top of that, SEIU is described as a key financial backer of Working Ontario Women, a group that has launched a large attack ad campaign against PC Party leader Patrick Brown. The links between SEIU and the Liberals lead to serious ethics questions, especially coupled with the attack ads that were funded by SEIU.", "For that reason, I would like the government to answer my question from last Tuesday, and I expect a response—I hope for a response—that directly answers my question, because, in all honesty, we could save some serious time if the government does. All they have to tell me is yes or no. I do not want to hear a lengthy explanation on the merits of the policy; the Premier has already shared those talking points.", "So I will ask one more time: Will the government release all of the correspondence that the Premier’s office and the minister’s office had with SEIU and all other relevant stakeholders ahead of their quiet October announcement for this new, secretive home care agency?", "Thank you, Speaker.

They’re doing it in other jurisdictions such as California, Maryland, Montana, Oregon and Texas, and a few of them have chosen to give their clients this option. They also do this in the UK. Washington state also has more than half of their home care clients use self-directed care, which enables them to select and hire their PSW, with the state taking responsibility for wages, benefits and taxes, similar to our agency.", "Let’s remember, as well, that this is something that we are piloting in this province. It’s happening in a few specific places to deal with a few specific clients who have very high needs.", "So I hope this is sufficient to satisfy. I hope the member is satisfied. I think you should be satisfied, but that’s up to you, not up to me. I do appreciate the opportunity to have this late show. I’d be happy to send the Donner report over to you, but I think you could probably get it online, or you’ve maybe, hopefully, seen it online.", "I just want to thank you very much. The late show was well worth waiting for." ],

  "text" : [ "Unfortunately, I have to be here tonight to discuss a simple matter that relates to the drug Orkambi, which was the substance of my question today, which in no way did the minister come close to answering. Drugs like Orkambi—this particular drug is for cystic fibrosis. Many drugs for rare diseases throughout Canada are unavailable in Ontario. The government does not pay for drugs like Orkambi.", "This came about because, during the general government committee, we had a cystic fibrosis advocate at committee stating the problems he’s having getting Orkambi covered. Orkambi right now is caught in the pCPA process, which is how the provinces negotiate a price. Unfortunately, for the last two years, there’s been no movement on this drug. The drug Orkambi, which is very, very successful in treating people with cystic fibrosis, giving them their life back to work in the community, to have a family, to live, is unavailable to the people of Ontario because it’s stuck in the pCPA.", "I admitted to the advocate the fact that Orkambi isn’t going to be covered, like many other rare disease drugs, because this government has failed on having accessibility to these rare disease medications. The response from the member from Kitchener Centre was that OHIP+ will pay for Orkambi. We were all flabbergasted, and it shut down the advocate’s discussion. He was taken aback, because obviously it answered what he was asking for. Of course, a call and an email to the ADM proved that this was untrue. The government is not covering Orkambi and other medications for rare diseases.", "Mr. Speaker, this government, this Liberal government under Kathleen Wynne and Minister Hoskins, the health minister, has failed Ontarians with rare diseases. Conditions have not been able to be met. The drugs are either denied because of their expense or they get tied up in the bureaucratic process headed by the provincial government. This has to change. Drugs like Orkambi need to be covered to give people their lives back.", "The response I got from the government was, “The PC Party doesn’t support OHIP+.” That’s false; the PC Party supports OHIP+. What the PC Party is trying to do is inject the reality of the system, that drugs like Orkambi are not going to be covered. OHIP+ will carry the same formulary and cover the same drugs as Trillium, OW, ODSP and the seniors’ plan. And guess what? Those formularies, those drug plans, do not cover Orkambi or any other new, innovative medication needed for rare disease coverage.", "This government has been a failure. For them to propagate the idea that OHIP+ is the saviour to everybody’s needs is terrible, considering OHIP+, at the end of the day, is going to take away private coverage from those kids 25 and under because drug plans will move away. If the government’s the first payer, why would they bother to have drug coverage over the time? A lot of those kids’ private coverage pays for Orkambi. So when this OHIP+ starts up and this government has failed in covering rare disease medications, those kids are going to lose coverage for drugs like Orkambi. That has to change.", "This government has to come clean and be honest with the people of Ontario. Yes, we’re giving free drugs to kids under 25, but the Liberal government is a failure when it comes to covering rare disease drugs and take-home cancer drugs, and they shouldn’t be telling the people of Ontario otherwise. They shouldn’t be writing this policy on the fly, which is leading to the errors that are occurring in our committees, where the member from Kitchener Centre is making announcements about drug coverage which aren’t true.", "This has to stop. They have to be honest with the people. They need to fix the system. They need to start covering drugs like Orkambi. There are many people with rare diseases in this province who are unable to access the treatments they need. There are many people suffering from cancer who can’t access the new, innovative drugs. Why? It’s because this government’s financial mismanagement of this province has left few to no dollars to pay for these new medications, and because they’ve created this pCPA bureaucracy which adds time for drugs to be approved and sold and paid for by the province of Ontario.", "This government needs to look within itself. OHIP+ is good. Thank you for doing it. But don’t tell people you’re going to be covering medications that you’re not. Don’t give people false hope. It’s time to be honest with Ontarians. It’s time to look at the Ontario drug benefit system. It’s time to find a way to find access to these rare disease drugs and fund them so that Ontarians can live quality, healthy lives." ],

I would like to thank him for his question, and speak to OHIP+ and what the government is putting forward.", "He’s correct in saying that 4,400 drugs that are on the formulary for ODB will be covered as of January 1 for every person under 25. This is a big step forward.", "What the member opposite needs to remember is, there are 4,400 drugs in the formulary. I know he’s referring to a comment that was made in committee yesterday. But I know the member opposite, because of his profession, would know this: There are 4,400 drugs. I could ask the member opposite right now whether a drug is covered or not, and even though he has some greater understanding than many of us do in this House, he may not be able to say if it’s covered or it’s not covered.", "He also knows that the pCPA, the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance—that’s all the provinces getting together to ensure that we get the best value when we negotiate drug prices. It’s not a bureaucracy that was created to slow things down. It is a national process that will ensure that we are getting the best value when we negotiate that price. We’re negotiating as one, not 10 different provinces. If he wants to talk about being straightforward with people in regard to that, then he should say that out loud. He knows that.", "I know the member is aware that we make decisions on pharmaceuticals and drugs that we’re going to cover through an evidence-based process that’s done by professionals. It’s not a political process. It’s done by physicians, it’s done by scientists, it’s done by health care economists to ensure that we are making the right decisions. These are hard decisions. The rate of growth in new drugs is incredible, and we have to make sure that they’re, number one, safe, and number two, effective to ensure that we get the outcome we want, which is either a cure or relief for a person from a condition that they have.", "I’ll go back to politics. I get the politics of “We’re six months away.” I think that the member opposite in his question is exaggerating what I would consider to be—I think the member from Kitchener Centre responded in committee to her initial statement.", "The member opposite knows the challenges that governments have in being able to fund drugs and ensuring that the things on the formulary are efficacious and helpful and safe for people. It’s a very challenging part of health care.", "We already have the most generous plan for seniors in all of Canada. We’re going to have the most generous plan for Ontarians under 25 and over 65 and for those people who need exceptional access or who are on social assistance.", "Again, I just say to the member opposite that there are real challenges in ensuring we get these things on the formulary, especially with issues like rare diseases, and I very much don’t feel that his representation of what was put forward in committee is fair.", "I would like to thank you, Speaker, for the opportunity to respond to this." ],

According to statistics published by the Ministry of Transportation, the number of deaths caused by distracted walking did not increase at all between 1993 and 2012.

However, these MTO statistics show that deaths due to distracted driving nearly tripled during the same time. The OPP says that distracted driving now causes more deaths than impaired driving or speeding.

Today we’re debating the Strengthening Protection for Ontario Consumers Act. That’s a wonderful idea. We always should be protecting consumers, and here is a bill that we are supporting. But I have two desks in front of me covered with letters and thoughts to share from my constituency, from members of my community who would like more protection, who would like different protection, who feel that they were not included in this five-schedule piece of legislation.", "Focusing on what is indeed in this piece of legislation, as I said, there are five schedules, but 1, 2 and 4 deal with new home construction warranties and the real estate sector. I might speak a little bit later about Tarion at length, depending on how we are for time, but essentially, Tarion is something that the government has had 14 years to fix, and repeatedly they have refused to do so, despite countless consumer complaints. Unfortunately, this is kind of a detail-free, enabling piece of legislation. I don’t think that there is any reason to believe that those minor changes are going to result in any kind of changes that will finally give new home buyers the protections that they need and that they deserve. But we will come back to Tarion in a little bit—well, maybe we will; we’ll see how we are for time. Like I said, I’ve heard from community members and I want to bring their voices here, and not just say the same thing we’ve been saying for 14 years, which is that we need a fulsome review of Tarion, and we need to see the kind of changes that would actually have an impact on homeowners.", "Schedule 3: We’re glad to see that this government is bringing forward protections when it comes to improving transparency and enhancing consumer protection in the online ticket resale market. Speaker, you may remember that this part of the legislation really came about in the unfortunate wake of the Tragically Hip concert that so many fans—and I know that really everyone in Canada, and certainly in Ontario, are fans. So many were unable to get tickets because of the online bot world, the scalper bots. We all knew it was a problem, but this was such a personal, and unfortunate, chance for us to see just how little competition there is in getting tickets. It’s not the way it used to be when you—well, I was going to say, “the way it used to be when you would go online.” I’m sure there was a time before online, but that’s a really long time ago—getting tickets and paying what they were worth. In the online ticket resale market, there is an increased amount that you will pay above and beyond what’s on the actual ticket, but here, with the scalper bots—we need to fix that.", "I was here the other day when the Attorney General spoke at length about this change and acknowledged—and I think we all understand—that sometimes regulation cannot keep up with technology, that technology moves faster than regulation can keep up with. Even if regulation tries, we still are going to find all these loopholes. We had had a bit of a back-and-forth where I said that, yes, I am more than happy to blame the government for the scalperbot loophole, but we all do recognize that it may have been inadvertent. But here we have the opportunity to fix part of it, and that is very important.", "While we’re talking about access to the online world, whether it’s buying tickets or any other way of participating not just in our online economy, but our online space, I want to take the opportunity to say that our northern community members and our rural community members in Ontario, on a regular basis, advocate for better Internet service, for broadband, for any kind of high speed. There are so many parts of our fine province where folks aren’t able to access the online world, and if they do, it’s at really slow speeds and it’s intermittent service. That’s something that we really should fix. It’s something that at every opportunity that I’ve had to talk to a northern or rural community member—at AMO, we hear about it on a regular basis. This is a perfect example. If you don’t have high-speed Internet, if you don’t have access to the Internet, how on earth can you even get in the game to buy a ticket or to do so many other things that we take for granted not just in the Toronto area but anywhere that has access to high-speed Internet?", "That’s another part of the conversation. But back to this bill with schedule 3: I made the joke that we need a mortal portal. That certainly isn’t a direction that this bill goes in. But regular folks, of course, cannot click fast enough, cannot keep up with the computer or with these high-speed bots. As I’ve said before and I maintain, everybody needs access to entertainment, Speaker, when they are dealing on a regular basis with this government and with so many of the struggles in our communities.", "Schedule 3, though, specifically enacts a new act entitled the Ticket Sales Act. It replaces the Ticket Speculation Act. As I said, it was in response to the public outcry following the sold-out final tour of the Tragically Hip. Specifically, the act stipulates that anyone who sells a ticket on the secondary market at a price that exceeds the face value of the ticket—the seller must be able to guarantee a full refund under certain circumstances, confirm that the ticket is valid, and tickets cannot be resold for more than 50% of their face value.", "It explicitly bans bots—and bots, Speaker, for the folks at home that might not be exactly sure what a bot is: It’s automated ticket-purchasing software that is designed to go around or circumvent ticket-purchasing procedures of online sellers. That’s what a bot is.", "As I mentioned, the Attorney General in his remarks the other day acknowledged that sometimes regulation can’t keep up with the technology or advances that are happening. I think we intuitively understand that as we look out and we see the changing face of our online world and technologies, there is a lot to keep up with. We acknowledge that. It is a bit concerning that enforcing this ban, even though we all agree it should exist—to ban the bots—is going to be difficult. I think that this, or a different version of this conversation, will be one that we have again in this Legislature as we’re talking about protecting consumers.", "I’m going to go to some of the letters that I’ve had. We reached out to our constituency office. They hear on a regular basis from folks needing protections for various things. This bill is called the Strengthening Protection for Ontario Consumers Act. I want to talk about protecting those consumers. Back in the spring, I had brought it to the Legislature’s attention that I had been approached by a very engaging door-to-door salesman who had questions about my energy consumption. He wondered if I knew that Ontario was going green, and if I also wanted to go green. We had a very engaging conversation in my driveway. He was a very engaging man who wanted to know if I knew what the government was doing. I said, “Not even on a good day, no.” He said, “Well, they’re going green. Would you also like to go green?” I said, “Going green? Tell me all about it.” And so he did. It was fascinating because the company was not asking me to give them money—it wasn’t for them; it was for their going green initiatives. The money would be used to go green on my behalf. So I wasn’t giving money directly; they would be investing it in going green initiatives. I don’t really know what those would be. Anyway, it was on my behalf, so that I could sleep at night knowing that I was helping to make the world a greener place. Basically, it was so that I could buy my way out of my carbon emissions. I tried not to take it personally, but he told me about how much carbon I was personally emitting. I don’t know how he would ever know that. It was very personal. He even offered to come into my home and check out different readings of—I don’t even know what he was suggesting. It was a fascinating conversation. I kind of wish that I could go back and see it again. I did not admit that I knew anything about anything. I was just engaged in this conversation and couldn’t imagine that a home like mine emitted so much carbon that it weighed as much as an elephant or something like that. It was an elephant-sized amount of carbon emissions that I was responsible for, but I would be able to buy my way out of it with these green credits. It wasn’t even that complicated; he was willing to put it on my Enbridge bill for me.", "Flash forward: I did not invite him in to check out my water heater or read various other things. I did not sign a binding or expensive scam contract, despite the fact that he was charming and engaging and this was my chance to help with the green initiatives.", "What was so concerning and why I brought this up in the spring was not because, “Oh, my goodness, guess what happened to me?” It was, “Oh, my goodness, this happens on a regular basis.” They happened to catch me in my driveway, but they were catching people at their front doors and in their homes. People feel responsible to make an environmental difference. They also think that when someone comes to their door with contracts and things to sign—especially newcomers, or if English is a bit challenging, or someone like my grandma, who is going to accept it, perhaps, at face value. If someone tells her that you have to do this, then she might think that she has to do this. This is what is so frustrating: that our vulnerable neighbours, our seniors, our new Canadians are signing contracts like these every day.", "A gentleman in our riding, Mr. O’Boyle, had his heat cut off because he couldn’t pay the over $300 a month that was tacked onto his bill because of these various contracts. His issues were brought to us through his family members, who were doing their darnedest to advocate on his behalf because these expenses had piled up on his Enbridge bill—these third parties that can just tack themselves on, and you’ve got to pay it. That is, of course, very concerning.", "Our office does work with families regularly trying to untangle these predatory schemes.", "Folks who show up at the doorstep are looking for people who don’t know what they’re getting into. This particular company that came to my door does have a track record. They’ve been fined by the OEB. It doesn’t take more than a Google search to see the litany of complaints that they leave in their wake. They and others are looking for vulnerable populations who don’t understand their rights or obligations, their responsibilities as tenants, renters or homeowners. They really do prey on people who don’t understand.", "Speaker, I believe firmly that no business in Ontario should be allowed to build their bottom line preying on vulnerable people.", "I know that we’ve had this conversation or a version of this conversation a number of times in this Legislature, about the door-to-door sales and what they can and can’t sell. This is another area we’re doing our best to keep up with. We’ve said that they can’t sell certain products like natural gas or different things at the door, but now there’s a whole new workaround, a whole new product line that they can sell. Again, it’s that constant struggle of keeping up with nefarious opportunity.", "I have a couple more examples. We’re always working with the legal clinic in our community to try to connect folks with services and help when they get into these tangles.", "Here’s another example: a couple who live in subsidized housing. They were sold a water filtration system. They were told, “Don’t worry.” They’re both on ODSP, but they were told not to worry, that they would be fine. They were also given the 10-day cooling-off information, but when they tried to cancel, they couldn’t get through to anyone to even ask how the water filter would be returned. Then they got a call from a collection agency threatening them, telling them that because they still had the water filtration unit, they were obligated to pay.", "They were advised to send a registered letter to the collection agency telling them to stop contacting them and proceed to Small Claims Court for judgment—this was how the legal clinic had advised them—but then they were also left with a hole in their counter. This is just one tiny example of the rigmarole that ensues when someone gets into a contract that they may or may not understand and is predatory in nature.", "Another case that the legal clinic put on our radar: A woman received bills from a lawn care company that had sprayed her lawn, but she had not authorized it. She was told that because they had sprayed, she would have to pay, even though she didn’t sign a contract for services, which is required for a bill of services or merchandise over $50. Again, this is just one example of somebody taking advantage and trying to get money where they can.", "I can’t imagine how challenging it is to keep up with all of these, because even just in our office we hear about all of these creative, predatory folks that are out there. How on earth you keep up or keep ahead of them is always the challenge, but I believe that that’s our responsibility. If we’re strengthening protections for Ontario consumers, those are some great examples.", "Here’s another one. I got a letter on behalf of seniors. Someone wrote in that “it worries me how many senior citizens in our community and in the province receive ... letters requesting money from them....", "“I don’t believe there is any legislation protecting seniors from predatory practices such as this.", "“It is my desire to see legislation ... put in place to prevent ‘companies or charities’ to target senior citizens.", "“I see every day in the news horror stories about senior citizens losing part of their life savings to scams, and the reason for this, in part, I believe, is because we legally allow predatory upsale/donation request practices from charities and other companies with no control....", "“I am not a senior, but I would hate something like this would happen to my senior family members, and by the time I learn of this, there is nothing that can be done to get them out of an onerous contract that they did not fully understand.”", "Speaker, I hope Grandma is not watching today, because I’m going to tell you a little story. She tells it very differently, but this is as a concerned family member. She was getting a lot of lottery mail and charity mail. Once you’re on one mailing list as a vulnerable senior, they seem to circulate your address. She was right in the thick of all of these different scams, and was convinced that they were real and that this money was real, that she was standing to win money.", "Oh my gosh, keeping up with the scams was unbelievable. I remember being on the phone one day with somebody who was calling her. I picked it up and talked to this scam artist, who said to me, “You might be her family, but I’m going to get the house.” This man—I don’t know where he lived and I don’t know what he got out of it, but he had been calling her on a daily basis, asking about the garden, asking about her neighbours, asking about her granddaughter and asking about her life, inserting himself into her daily trust. He became almost like a friend, someone who calls every day and asks you how your day is going, just so that he could scam her and take her money.", "They had cancelled her phone service, pretending to be her. They had tried to isolate her from her family, but we were able to advocate and we were able to help her to ensure that she wasn’t further scammed. Here’s another perfect example of a way that a vulnerable part of our community deserves protection.", "Here we have this bill in front of us that we’ve been speaking about at length. We’re supporting the bill, but we always need to be having the conversation about how best to protect consumers across the province in an ever-changing landscape of predatory opportunity.", "Speaker, I said that I might be able to get to Tarion if I had time; I’m not going to. I know that that is part of the conversation we need to keep having, for goodness’ sake. Four seconds left—I’ll leave it for someone else to do." ],

We are pleased to see that the new authority will have Auditor General oversight and a mandatory internal ombudsman. The legislation, which abolishes Tarion, would implement a separate regulator and may not take place for a number of years.", "We wanted to comment on the member from Oshawa about her family member receiving calls. I hear about that on a regular basis at my office as well. So if there is some form of reform and if we can stop these kinds of intrusions, whether it’s family or constituents, even with no relation to us, I think we should do everything we can to do that because these individuals are vulnerable. They’re often living alone and maybe don’t have a lot of family close by. These people are some of the lowest of the low who take advantage of these people. I’d certainly like to see us do something that’s even more drastic if I had the opportunity to do so. I think this is probably too easy on them.

In this particular piece of legislation, all that it does is enable the Lieutenant Governor in Council to set out the cases when double-ending is prohibited, to say when it would be prohibited. But the default is for this practice to continue unless specifically prohibited. So it will just continue. But at least now they’ve laid out when it wouldn’t be allowed. They’re not disallowing it.

Comme vous le savez, on trouve quatre mesures, programmes, initiatives ici. Par exemple, premièrement, le renouvellement du Régime de garanties des logements neufs de l’Ontario; deuxièmement, la Loi sur le courtage commercial et immobilier; troisièmement, la Loi sur le secteur du voyage; et quatrièmement, la Loi sur la vente de billets.", "Si elle est adoptée, la loi, intitulée Loi sur le renforcement de la protection des consommateurs ontariens, permettra de donner aux amateurs des chances égales d’acheter des billets pour voir l’équipe, le concert ou le spectacle de leur choix. Parmi les modifications proposées, on dénote l’interdiction des logiciels d’achat automatisé de billets et la vente de billets qui ont été achetés à l’aide de ces logiciels.", "Speaker, reference was made to bots. Bots, as you know, are automated scripts, automated programs. It’s actually a very deep field. There are Web crawlers, Web spiders, robot software devices—all of these are, short form, known affectionately as bots. There are ticket bots, chat bots, Twitter bots, zombie bots. You’ll be pleased to know that Siri on Apple and Cortana on Microsoft are themselves types of bots. Whether you’re ordering food or shopping or saving money or banking or whatever, you’re likely to be interacting. Of course, these have gained extreme attention because of not only the automated force with which they can flood the Internet—particularly, for example, Twitter. As you know, this is a major controversy going on right now in the United States and elsewhere, and likely perhaps even in Canada, with regard to the influence of election—for example, fake accounts flooding, automatically retweeting and automatically repopulating different Internet sites. Of course, one of those types of bots, ticket bots, is what we’re trying to address here with regard to the automated sale and almost, you could say, theft of legitimate marketplace activity.", "Aussi dans les modifications proposées, on dénote, par exemple, la limite du prix de revente des billets à 50 % au-dessus de la valeur nominale; l’obligation pour les entreprises qui vendent des billets de spectacle de divulguer davantage de renseignements aux consommateurs; et la mise en place de nouvelles mesures d’application de la loi pour veiller à ce que les entreprises de vente et de revente de billets observent les règles en vigueur.", "Ces modifications mettront les amateurs en premier en empêchant la hausse excessive du prix des billets sur le marché de la revente, en permettant aux amateurs d’obtenir davantage de renseignements dès le début et en prévenant la fraude dans la vente de billets de spectacle.", "Speaker, as has been mentioned, in our constituency office we often hear of individuals who have looked forward to some kind of cultural event, whether it’s at a sporting or concert or other venue across this great province, and unfortunately a number of individuals, first of all, are late to the game, literally, because they are unable to outdo the automated software, the Twitter bots and the chat bots and the ticket bots. That leads to price gouging by the individuals who are eventually able to resell these.", "That’s one component among a number of others that some of my colleagues will be addressing, but as I say, Speaker, I think it’s important that we get with the program here and quickly pass and move through committee and legislate Bill 166, the Strengthening Protection for Ontario Consumers Act, 2017." ],

We want all Ontarians to be well protected and again, as I’ve said, well informed about choices they’re making when they’re purchasing things small or large. Whether that’s booking a much-anticipated vacation or buying tickets to see a favourite band or buying and selling a house, we are committed to protecting those consumers. So we’ve created this legislation. Many members opposite and, indeed, from this side of the House have referred to the necessary reforms that the public is crying out for. This legislation, if passed, will strengthen those protections and address those cries for reform.", "Very specifically, Bill 166, if passed, is going to introduce rules to better protect consumers buying travel services or event tickets, and buying or selling real estate, including newly built homes.", "What I’d like to do now—and I’ve got about 10 minutes—is speak to a few very specific consumer protection rules that are included in Bill 166. I want to speak briefly about the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, number one. I want to speak about the Real Estate Council of Ontario, which has enforcement obligations. I do want to speak about the new home warranty program, particularly about the role of Tarion. And if I have time, I want to say a few words about the travel industry and something about ticket speculation.", "With regard to the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, we are introducing new legislation that, as I say, if passed, will enhance protections, but particularly it’s going to address this issue of conflict-of-interest scenarios that have been arising in multiple situations. We’ve been reading about it in the press. So a home purchaser is entitled to be represented by an agent who has their exclusive interests at the fore. When we have conflict-of-interest situations where parties to a transaction are in doubt as to who the agent offers the duty of care to and should be offering the best advice to, we want to clear that up.", "The legislation is going to create very strong and very clear rules for cases where one real estate professional or one brokerage represents more than one party in a real estate trade. This is part of our other piece, the Fair Housing Plan, which was introduced in 2017. There will be substantial fines for code-of-ethics violations with respect to these conflict-of-interest rules.", "We will consult, during the regulation development phase, on how those conflict-of-interest rules are going to be developed so that they are fair in terms of the obligations they place on the agent, and fair in the obligations and protections that consumers can expect.", "I want to say something about the Real Estate Council of Ontario. That’s the administrative authority that was established by the government, and it is responsible for enforcing the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act. If the legislation is passed, RECO is expected to take on a very active role in informing both consumers and real estate professionals about the changes and impacts of this legislation. In addition, RECO will have an education role along with its enforcement role, enforcing the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act and the various regulations.", "If the proposed legislation is approved, the maximum fines for a breach of the code of ethics are going to increase from $25,000 to $50,000 for individual persons and brokers, and for a brokerage house, a brokerage company, $100,000. So we are serious about seeing these protections implemented.", "I want to say a couple of words now about something that we’re all hearing about, and that’s the new home warranty program renewal. Ontario has introduced legislation that, again, if passed, will strengthen the confidence that Ontario’s new home warranties and protections create in the province. Strengthening the confidence of consumers is in many ways what this legislation is about. We strengthen the consumers’ confidence by having effective protections and rules around these various issues that we’re talking about today.", "Particularly with respect to the new home warranty program, the proposed changes—again, if passed—would do a couple of things. They would provide two administrative authorities: One will administer the new home warranty program and one will regulate new home builders and vendors. So there’s the program implementation and then there’s the regulation of new home builders and vendors. It will also make the dispute resolution process easier for homeowners if there is a problem in the construction of the home. We do not want consumers to be tied up in unnecessary legal tangles and other tangles if there is a consumer issue to be dealt with.", "We are going to strengthen the regulation of new home builders and vendors, because the vendors and the builders are the ones that are supplying the product, and when there are issues around warranties and so on, it’s inevitably with the products. So a better product and a better oversight of product construction should go a long way to alleviating the necessity for having a heavy hammer on the regulation side.", "Government is going to take over some of the responsibility in making these rules and setting the standards, but again, we are going to do that with counsel, in consultation with our partners.", "I was going to say a few words particularly about Tarion, because that’s a necessary component of this, but perhaps if later in the afternoon I have the chance to speak again, I will.

Of course, that means that the status quo—all of the problems that we have seen in Tarion for decades—will remain in effect. The minister responsible herself admitted that the new system will most likely not be implemented until 2020. So we are still some years away from fixing those problems that were highlighted so effectively by my colleague the former member for Trinity–Spadina, Rosario Marchese, when he brought in his private member’s bill on Tarion, and also my other colleague the former member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton, Jagmeet Singh, when he brought in his private member’s bill.", "Speaker, the Liberal government has had 14 years to deal with these issues.

They have exclusive responsibility for administering the home warranties plan, but we do want to bring some changes there.", "If the legislation is passed, during the transition to the two-entity regime Tarion would continue to perform its current role, but—and this is the important piece here—under a much-strengthened oversight framework that is going to include a couple of issues.", "There will be a greater government role in respect of rule-making through minister approval of certain Tarion bylaws that are deemed to be regulations. So we are putting ministerial oversight directly into the Tarion process. This will authorize the minister to appoint an administrator if it is felt that there are serious concerns arising regarding Tarion’s performance during the transition period, and to ensure that certain conditions are satisfied.", "This is important because Ontario’s consumers look to Tarion for these ultimate protections. It’s the backup. It’s the safety valve. Because of its importance, the legislation, if passed, will ensure that there is a direct ministerial oversight of issues that may arise at Tarion that require redress." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s my pleasure to debate this afternoon on this legislation which is intended to protect consumers, we’re told. That’s right in the title. Let me get the full title—no, this is schedule 2: Protection for Owners and Purchasers of New Homes Act, 2017. There are four schedules to the legislation. I do want to focus exclusively on schedule 2, and the lack of protection offered by schedule 2 for owners of new homes and warranties.", "I’m going to first start off, Speaker—we know that this was all motivated by Justice Cunningham’s report. He spent a good deal of time talking and discussing and examining the various problems that Tarion and Ontario’s new home warranty program had created for so many consumers in this province. He had a mandate from this government to investigate Tarion, investigate the new home warranty program and come up with recommendations. He came up with 37 recommendations—37 recommendations. After examining the problem in detail, all the recommendations hinged on one fundamental aspect—and I just want to read briefly from Justice Cunningham’s report:", "“I do not believe that this problem and the challenges I have identified can be adequately addressed in the current model without significant and structural changes to the new home warranty sector in Ontario.” And then he goes on: “The proposed framework—a mandatory new home warranty program delivered through a competitive multi-provider warranty system, with a separate builder/vendor regulator, independent adjudication of warranty disputes, and rule-making subject to government approval.”", "This bill fails to act on those recommendations of a “competitive multi-provider warranty system” and “independent adjudication of warranty disputes.” The very fundamental proposal that Justice Cunningham put forth was rejected. Now, the government never said they rejected it; they just didn’t act upon it.", "If we want to see how this played out, after Justice Cunningham’s report, the ministry of consumer protection created a new home warranty program renewal stakeholder consultation group. This group met through the summer to advise the government on legislation for Tarion. I’m reading straight from the ministry’s summary of those discussions, on page 2: “Over the course of six sessions, the working group provided feedback” on the following topics. Feedback, however, was not asked for on the following subjects: a multi-provider warranty delivery model—the very essence of Justice Cunningham’s recommendation was prohibited from being discussed by this government through the stakeholder consultation group—homeowner appeals of warranty authority decisions to a third-party builder or vendor; and appeals of licensing and related decisions. The independent adjudication? Prohibited from speaking about it. The two essential components of consumer protection and of Justice Cunningham’s report—this government prohibited their own stakeholder consultation group from discussing it. Not just bringing forth proposals; they were prohibited from discussing it.", "Speaker, if you go to the very last page of the ministry’s summary of this consultation group, you’ll see 10 people identified as members of that stakeholder group. Five of them are employed by Tarion—five of them. Five of the 10 are Tarion talking heads. This is supposedly an independent stakeholder consultation group, and they went and stacked the deck against consumers in this province. They handcuffed the group and said, “You’re not going to speak about a competitive, multiservice provider. You’re not going to speak about independent adjudication of warranty disputes, and then we’re going to stack the deck with Tarion employees and contractors to make sure that consumers won’t get the protection they think they were going get with this bill.”", "Speaker, I find it troubling. Here it is: In June 2017, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services established a working group to provide service and to provide advice and input on proposals for the legislative changes that would be required to implement the government’s plan. That’s key: not to implement Justice Cunningham’s recommendations but to implement the government’s plan. I ask you, Speaker: Is that an honest way to do things? Is that a sincere and genuine way to do things, to take Justice Cunningham’s recommendations, tell everybody that they’re going to bring forth legislation, create a working group to provide advice to the government, but then stack the deck and handcuff that group so that they cannot even speak about Justice Cunningham’s recommendations?", "I think that anybody who looks at the evidence and examines this will come to the same conclusion that I came to. This was not a sincere attempt to address the problems of Tarion. It was not a genuine attempt to improve consumer protection. It was anything but genuine or sincere. It was to create a façade, to create an appearance while actually doing the opposite.", "I guess we ought not to be surprised. This is not the first time in my 10 years here that I have seen this sort of devious behaviour, this skirting around and using vocabulary to make it appear that one thing is happening when another is not.", "There are some marginal improvements, but without adopting and accepting the proposed framework, they really ring hollow and empty. I guess the most significant element of this is that now the warranty provider falls under oversight of the Auditor General’s office. That’s a good thing. However, the Auditor General focuses on the financial dealings and not the operational aspects of a subordinate body of the Legislature.", "On the financial side, there can be and will be some scrutiny over this new delegated administrative authority, but only on the financial side. On the operations side, this Legislature will have no teeth. We’ll have no oversight; we’ll have no scrutiny over the new home warranty program.", "This could have been adopted by having Ontario’s Ombudsman providing consumers with a relief valve, or a remedy, when or if a problem arises, but, no, Speaker, they rejected that completely.", "They also have stuck with the licensing appeals tribunal as the adjudicative model for new home warranty disputes, and this is astonishing. Justice Cunningham said we needed to have independent arbitration, and persons who are knowledgeable of the subject to be the adjudicators.", "Just for those who aren’t aware of this, the licence appeals tribunal does everything from parole board hearings to animal welfare cases to driver’s licence suspensions. They do a mixed bag of things, and, I think we can all say, with mixed results as well. The licence appeals tribunal has not demonstrated efficiencies or effectiveness in their tribunal system. That, indeed, has been one of the long-standing faults, and the place of origin of complaints by consumers is the licence appeals tribunal.", "Again, this government, and this minister—because I know; I’ve spoken to people on that stakeholder consultation group. We had one consumer protection advocate out of the 10. With 10 people in that group, only one was a consumer protection advocate.", "Speaker, to purposely construct this group and stack the deck and prevent it from discussing the fundamental recommendations is obscene. That is not what we should ever accept in a representative democracy, or in any sort of democracy.", "It was interesting. I have to say this: Going through schedule 2, they did make one change that I think is important, and I think it illustrates this government’s view of legislation and this government’s view of public policy.", "If you go to page 50, section 47(1)(b) in the act, you’ll notice that there was a change. Let me just read it—yes, 47(1)(b). In the present act—and this is about warranties—47(1)(b) right now says “constructed in a workmanlike manner and is free from defects in material.” That’s a reasonable approach; that’s one of the criteria under the Warranties section.", "We all know what “workmanlike manner” and “free from defects” mean. But this government changed 47(1)(b). It now says: “constructed in a skilful manner” instead of “a workmanlike manner.” We know why. Maybe I should put this out: Do we know why we changed the term “workmanlike” to “skilful”?" ],

Justice Cunningham’s report has been cherry-picked so that there is no effectiveness. I would say that we’ve just wasted nearly $1 million on Justice Cunningham’s report. Now, I know $1 million is not much to this government, but to most people in this province, $1 million is a substantial amount of money.

We know that there are hundreds and hundreds of people who have felt disenfranchised and have felt that they have been dealt unfairly with by Tarion over the years. They want to have answers as well.

Speaker, while New Democrats do not share that member’s enthusiasm for a competitive, for-profit model, we do have some of the same concerns he pointed to in his speech, and that is, the Liberal government’s disregard for the recommendations that were brought forward by Justice Cunningham on how to reform Tarion and how to ensure Tarion actually protected Ontario consumers. Instead of listening to Justice Cunningham, instead of looking at other models—for example, a true public agency model—that might better serve Ontario consumers, this government, through Bill 166, has gone with a single-provider, delegated-authority model, which was not what Justice Cunningham had recommended.", "Our concern, as we have stated throughout this debate, remains the ineffectiveness of Bill 166 to actually address the problems that people are experiencing with their new homes. When they go to access the protections that should be in place through the Ontario New Home Warranty Program, they have found that they are out of luck because the system is not designed to actually protect consumers. I want to acknowledge the work of Karen Somerville from Canadians for Properly Built Homes to advocate on this issue, to bring these very real problems, these catastrophes that are faced by people in this province and the lack of any meaningful protection from Tarion, which, unfortunately, Bill 166 will not address." ],

This proposed legislation as it relates to Tarion is in fact based on the recommendations from the Honourable John Douglas Cunningham and on public and stakeholder feedback. Speaker, at one time in my life I worked in the home-building business. I know how huge a decision it is to build a home. The cost, of course, is enormous for families. But it’s not just the cost; it’s all of the hopes and dreams that go into the construction of a new home where a family will live and be together. So it’s really important that when people do make that big investment, they have confidence in their builder and that if things do not go as they should, to know that there is recourse for them.", "So, Speaker, I think this is important legislation. It’s good legislation. It’s based on extensive research and feedback. One of the things I am happiest about in this legislation is the dispute resolution process. That process has to be easier to protect consumers better. That’s exactly what it is doing. When a homeowner who might not have any background in construction discovers that something in their new home is not up to snuff, they need to be able to have the confidence that there is a process—a strong, solid process—where they can get the remedies that they deserve.", "This legislation also strengthens the regulation of new home builders and vendors, and, again, that’s important.

I think he did, as he always does, a very thorough review of this.", "I think a couple of key points that he talked about were that Justice Cunningham issued 37 recommendations regarding new home warranties, but actually, this bill implements a small fraction of them. The bill does not clarify whether appeals of warranty decisions will continue to rely on competing expert evidence—consumer’s expert versus warranty provider’s expert—rather than having an independent adjudicator hire an impartial expert to examine the facts per Justice Cunningham’s recommendation. I think what can’t be overlooked, as I said earlier in my comments, is that certainly you want consumer protection, you want balance.", "I built a new home a few years ago. What I want to see is that if there’s an unscrupulous builder, let’s go over and make sure that person is penalized. Let’s not whitewash with overregulation like this government tends to do, put in more red tape, more regulation, so that everybody in the industry suffers. It’s not providing much protection for the consumer. What it’s really doing is burdening those and letting the ones that actually are the ones creating the challenges for consumers off the hook.", "He talked a little bit about a key stakeholder being prohibited from consulting on the bill. Again, this whole transparency thing keeps coming back over and over. We heard again last week with the Auditor General very much a transparency concern. This morning, my colleague from Dufferin–Caledon raised the issue of advertising. Where’s the consumer protection there, where they’re actually utilizing taxpayer money to do partisan Liberal ads leading up to an election? Where is the consumer protection in that case?", "I think in regard to certainly the real estate industry, there are some changes being made. I think what we want to make sure there is, again, to go after people. If they are breaching the professional code of ethics, then increase those fines and go after those that break the law.

I’m not saying that it is the only thing that the government is doing—far from it.

Well, that’s nonsense. I know that they’re not against all regulations. When they were in government, they passed probably as many regulations as we have passed in our time in government, because regulations aren’t all bad. Many regulations are very necessary. They are there to protect our society. They are there to protect our people—in particular, regulations to do with health, the environment, consumer protection—to protect workers and other areas that are of important public interest. But there are regulations out there and processes out there that aren’t necessary, that are overly cumbersome and that need to be tackled. Sometimes they’re pretty minor. If you look at some of the provisions in this bill, some of them are fairly obscure. They have an impact, but on a particular sector of our economy or a particular set of businesses or a particular set of people in our communities.", "It’s difficult to come forward with an amendment to legislation or an amendment to a regulation every time you come up with these issues. So putting it into a bill like we have before us here today and providing a window for all legislators, on all sides of the House, and for all businesses across the province to know that every year, this government, no matter who is in power, is going to have a vehicle to help make things a little easier in this province when it comes to eliminating unnecessary burden and regulations—to make this province the easiest place in which to do business, which is something I often say when I’m out on the speaking circuit or speaking in this Legislature. We all ought to be making this province the easiest place in the world in which to do business. That doesn’t mean we’re going easy on anybody in terms of their obligations that serve the public good. What it means is that we’re ensuring that this is a competitive place to do business, that this is a place that doesn’t put unnecessary regulatory burden on our businesses or put our businesses through processes that are way too time-consuming.", "Many small businesses in this province just don’t have the time to comply with even the regulations that exist today. That’s why we need to—all of us need to—pay attention. We heard the voice of those small businesses. It’s not by accident that we’ve won Golden Scissors Awards and many times been one of the leading jurisdictions in Canada and North America when it comes to reducing regulatory burden. It’s because we’ve heard the voice of small businesses across this province when they say, “Help us do a better job of creating jobs in this economy and growing this economy by eliminating those unnecessary regulatory burdens that you come across.”", "Now, it sounds easy—and often, when you talk to businesses, many businesses will complain, no matter where you are on the continent, no matter what level of government you represent, about regulations. That’s not unusual. It actually happens quite frequently. Where I think it really matters is when you ask the business, “What, specifically, are we doing as a government that (1) you think is unnecessary and (2) is really getting in your way of being competitive or focusing on those things that really matter—the health issues, the safety issues, the workplace worker protection issues, the consumer protection issues?” That’s when we cut to the chase and we get businesses to really consider what matters to them. That’s what this legislation is all about.", "I want to thank the different ministers and their staff and ministries and their respective staff right across the government who have been involved in this initiative—because it’s not the Ministry of Economic Development and Growth that generally drives these things.

This group is passionate about what they do. They’re creative in what they bring forward.", "I’d love to take credit for all of the initiatives we’ve brought forward over the last 10 years or so. I was the founder of the Open for Business program initially way back in my first portfolio as Minister of Labour. So it’s something I’ve been involved in from day one. But many of these good ideas come from two places. One is our stakeholders themselves. That’s where a lot of the best ideas come from: our business community, our small businesses, our charities, our non-profit businesses. We’ve done a lot of work with them as well in reducing the regulatory burden for them.", "Other good ideas comes from our ministries, but a lot of the good ideas, when it comes to looking around the world and saying, “Yes, we’re known today in Ontario as a global best practice in reducing regulatory burden and we can be very proud of it”—yes, we have jurisdictions coming here from all over the world, looking at what we’ve done as we’ve eliminated 80,000 regulatory burdens. I’m going to repeat that: We have eliminated 80,000 regulatory burdens over the years. That’s something we can all be very proud of. At the same time, our work is hardly done. While we’re seen as a global best practice in reducing unnecessary regulatory burden, the fact of the matter is, there are still other jurisdictions doing other creative things that we can learn from. That’s what the Open for Business team does: They look globally, they search globally, to make sure that not only are we leading the world today in reducing regulatory burden; we’re looking at other jurisdictions to see what they are doing and we learn from what they’re doing and, where necessary, bring in good ideas here.", "That’s where I reach across the floor to my opposition colleagues to say: Look, there’s no monopoly on good ideas when it comes to reducing regulatory burden. We’re open to suggestions. We’re open to ideas. This type of bill is open to them as well. When they talk to our collective stakeholders and come up with ideas that can help make this province more competitive by reducing unnecessary regulatory burden, we’re going to listen because this is not a political bill. Let’s face it; nobody is going to be knocking on doors next spring and have people bring up the Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act, 2017. It’s not something that gets any of us re-elected. It’s not something that’s going to make a difference in any of our electoral fortunes. It’s a pretty non-partisan bill overall.", "I welcome the input of the opposition in this process. This bill is going through third reading, so the amendments are done now at committee. It’s coming through for its final debate in the House. If passed, it will make a difference in the lives of some of our businesses. It will make a difference in this province. It will save tens of millions of dollars—I think it’s in the neighbourhood of $22 million for businesses. That’s a good amount of money. It’s not a game-changer by any means, but it’s a good amount of money and it’s going to save hundreds of hours of time for our businesses as well and our business leaders, which is something that’s really important for small businesses as well.", "Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with all sides of the House as we go through this debate and continuing to advance our efforts to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden. It didn’t start, as I said, with this bill; it started many years ago when we conducted what we called round tables with business sectors. We did one sector at a time. I think we got up to about 13 different sectors. This was seen as a global best practice at the time. We said, “Give us five good things that we can do. We’ll agree to them. We’ll sit down and figure out how to implement them, and we’ll guarantee you that we will get them done in six months.” We did that for 13 different sectors, and that helped eliminate hundreds of thousands of costs to businesses, which was helpful and was able to help us work with sectors. It gave those sectors a feeling that they had a voice here at Queen’s Park, that their concerns about unnecessary regulatory burden, which had fallen on deaf ears for years—not because people didn’t care, but because there wasn’t a good vehicle to be able to move them forward and make those regulatory changes.", "So, Mr. Speaker, we basked in that for a while, and we moved very much on our way to reducing 80,000 regulatory burdens in this province. We recognized that a lot of the folks who we were talking to through those years were association heads, CEOs of businesses, sometimes labour leaders, but they were all leaders, representatives of others. The people we weren’t really getting through to, and not having a conversation with about reducing regulatory burden, were sometimes our front-line workers, and who knows better about regulatory burdens and about the paperwork that governments put businesses through—sometimes necessary, sometimes not so much—than the folks who are filling out those forms every day, the front-line workers?", "That’s why we looked for another vehicle, to try to go beyond the representatives, the CEOs and the labour leaders to the very front-line folks themselves. That’s where the Red Tape Challenge came about. The Red Tape Challenge, Mr. Speaker, has been a very significant success. I’ll share with the members some of the success that we’ve seen on that challenge. It’s an online platform, so businesses, business leaders, front-line workers or everyday Ontarians who have an interest in that particular sector, or retired workers from the sector who are still interested in that sector, can have input into government, into giving us ideas.", "We took it on sector by sector. We started with the auto parts sector. I think we’ve done some with the agriculture sector. We’ve done, I think, financial services. We’ve got about five sectors that we’re well into now. There are a couple of sectors that are reporting very soon. And in every instance we’ve had hundreds, if not thousands, of people participating. It has really been a help.", "When you think about it and you think about the money that we have been able to save our businesses through the Red Tape Challenge alone, it’s actually quite significant. Of the five consultations that have been held, 65,000 website views have taken place. I said “hundreds”; it’s 1,400 comments collected on ways to improve our regulatory environment.", "To date, the challenge has identified 171 opportunities that the government will act on to reduce burdens for businesses. There were other ideas that we brought forward where we looked and said either, “It’s something that’s necessary. We need to have it in place,” or “It’s something that we’re not able to work with right now.” But 171 improvements are well on their way to being made by this process already, so I think it’s a resounding success. It’s new. We’re going to keep working on it. We’re going to keep refining it as we go, but it’s a great way to get participation from people across the province and from front-line workers.", "That brings us to the bill before us today, the Reducing Regulatory Costs for Business Act, 2017. This bill, if enacted, would implement five new initiatives to reduce burden on Ontario businesses. The first, and one of the more interesting initiatives, is to reduce regulatory costs by requiring all ministries to offset every dollar of every new administrative cost to businesses by removing $1.25 of old, unnecessary costs. I’m going to get back to that in a little while, Mr. Speaker, because I want to talk a little bit more about what this will do, how important it is and how helpful it is, and to ease any fearmongering that may be out there on this particular provision.", "Another provision is streamlining compliance for small businesses. Small businesses are different than larger businesses; there’s no question. Small businesses don’t always have the capacity to do what governments ask them to do, so ensuring that undue burdens aren’t placed on small businesses right up front when new or amended regulations are introduced, ensuring that small businesses are treated with that knowledge, is really important. That’s a signal that will come out of this bill to small businesses across this province.", "The third area is international or national standards alignment. It sounds boring, but it’s really important, Mr. Speaker.", "We were fortunate, in Ontario, and I was fortunate, as Minister of Economic Development for the province, to lead the national dialogue, to lead the national negotiation that led to the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, the most ambitious free trade agreement that this country has ever agreed to. This is an internal free trade agreement. It reduces costs of doing business across the country. The shining piece to that agreement, the biggest achievement in that agreement is, we were the first jurisdiction anywhere in the world to put in place a mechanism that helps us nationally harmonize or mutually recognize standards and regulations across Canada. That mechanism is still in the process of being set up. The Canadian Free Trade Agreement is fresh and new, and it should be set up, I think, within the coming year. It finally provides a vehicle for businesses and governments across Canada to harmonize and standardize some of the regulations that drive businesses crazy. When they have 13 or 14 different regulatory regimes to work through to be able to do business across the country, it puts them at a horrible competitive disadvantage compared to other jurisdictions that may not have that kind of a challenge nationally. We’re finally tackling that, and I’m so proud to say that Ontario has led the way in that national initiative.", "But it’s not just about Canada—because the bulk of our trade here in Ontario is south of the border; it’s also about harmonizing our standards and regulations with jurisdictions to the south, whether it be the work that we’re doing on a memorandum of understanding with Michigan—which our Premier has so gracefully led in her close work with Governor Snyder in Michigan, mostly on the auto sector file, which is so important to our economy—or the work that we’ve done in reaching out to Ohio and Governor Kasich, and the opportunities that we have to work together to harmonize regulations and make it easier for cross-border business to take place. That’s an area that’s of great importance.", "So when we’re passing new regulations, we can have made-in-Ontario solutions if we deem that to be in the public interest, if it’s really important to do so, but we also ought to consider the importance of, whenever possible, harmonizing and standardizing those regulations with our sister jurisdictions to make sure that we’re not putting an unnecessary burden on businesses and that we’re keeping Ontario a competitive place to do business.", "The fourth area is rewarding good actors. Instead of focusing our time, when it comes to compliance, on the good guys, on those that have really good records when it comes to compliance and never have complaints about them, we should focus on the bad actors. That’s just a simple method of good compliance technique in today’s society. It’s not a new idea. The Ministry of Labour has done it for a number of years now, with very good success. It’s focusing on the bad actors and spending less time burdening those that are complying already, those with really good track records. It’s ensuring that you’re getting the maximum value out of your compliance efforts.", "The fifth area is one that’s also equally important: an electronic transmission guarantee. In this day and age, all governments ought to be able to provide businesses with the opportunity to do their work with governments online. I almost find it unfathomable that governments today still don’t have that capability. In fact, we’re committing to ensure that this government can deliver for our small businesses in providing small businesses with the option—they don’t have to; they can still do the paper work offline. But the required documentation for their compliance initiatives and applications can be done online, which will save businesses countless hours, time and money.", "I want to go back to the $1-for-$1.25 regulatory administration cost initiative. That was an initiative that—I think there was some time spent at committee in the discussions. That’s what committee is for, after all: to have discussions about these kinds of things. Some stakeholders brought some concerns about that piece of the legislation. We listened very carefully to those stakeholders, Mr. Speaker. I want to tell you that I respect the views of the stakeholders that brought forward their initiatives, but I truly believe that their concerns were entirely off base. At the end of the day, we moved an amendment anyway. The amendment probably wasn’t needed, but we moved it to provide a level of comfort to those who had raised some of those concerns, because I think the concern was that somehow or another—there were two concerns. One is that ministries that had to offset the $1.25 for every dollar that they imposed on businesses would somehow or another go straight to a regulation that was going to endanger people’s lives. I don’t know what government of any party or what bureaucrat in our government would ever do that. What would be the incentive for anyone to ever do that? And what cabinet is ever going to let them do that? There are checks and balances through our whole system. Why would we ever consider doing that? So I think that it was off base, the suggestion that that would happen. The fact of the matter is that ministries have two years to identify an offset. So to me that just really wasn’t a valid concern, but we passed an amendment anyway just to clarify that any regulations that are passed or eliminated as an offset need to, obviously, take into consideration health and safety and environmental issues, as they would have to do anyway.", "The second piece: that somehow or another, what we were doing would put a chill on ministries that have to pass regulations for health and safety. To that I say: That makes no sense. Ministers have two years to identify an offset for that—two years. And it doesn’t have to come from that particular ministry. The government has two years to identify the offset for that. So I recognize the concerns being raised, and I recognize that some parties may park their opposition on that particular hook, but I think they’re hiding behind it because it’s simply not legitimate to suggest that any regulation, even if it’s not for health or safety or the environment or consumer protection—any regulation a ministry needs to pass for the public good will not in any way be impacted by this legislation. Any ministry can bring forward any amendment under this provision. But over time, the government will have to ensure that they’re conscious of offsetting the administrative cost to businesses as that goes forward. The public interest is always sacrosanct; the public interest will always prevail.", "I would say that if a party says that they’re not going to support this bill because of that provision, (1) I don’t think that’s a legitimate argument, and I’ll be happy to listen to the arguments as we go forward; and (2) that puts that party clearly in a place where they’re the party that’s in favour of imposing unnecessary regulatory costs to businesses. Why would anybody in this Legislature ever want to penalize businesses without any public interest reason to do so? That’s just ridiculous. It’s bad for our economy. It’s bad for job creation.", "Every party always talks about their love of small business and the importance of small business in our economy. I think this bill is going to be a really good test, because it’s a very easy bill to support. It has no detrimental public interest issues at all to it, and it does reduce the cost of doing business in this province. So I think it will be a litmus test to see which parties in this Legislature really care about reducing the costs of business for businesses in this province, whether it’s big businesses or, more importantly, small businesses. Which parties in this Legislature care about keeping Ontario competitive?", "We’re in a good place right now. Our unemployment rate is at the lowest level it’s been in 17 years. It’s a good place to be. We’ve created 800,000 net new jobs since the global recession—a good place to be. We’re leading the G7 in growth—a good place to be.", "But it’s a fiercely competitive global economy out there, Mr. Speaker. We’re competitive today; we’re growing today; we’re doing well today. But there is no guarantee that in this fast, disrupting, technological new economy, we’re going to be there tomorrow, if we don’t continue to focus on ensuring that Ontario is one of the easiest places in the world in which to do business.", "I close off my comments—as I pass them on to my able parliamentary assistant, I see my good friend Tariq Zahoor is here today. We’re running a little bit late. I had a meeting with Tariq Zahoor, who is a representative of the Ahmadiyya movement in Islam and has been for many, many years. In fact, I met him many years ago. He knows business as well, and I know that Tariq would say we should support this bill.", "We should support all initiatives that reduce unnecessary regulatory burden. Let’s be champions for those regulations that are important. Let’s be champions for those regulations that improve the environment, that are good for health and safety, that are good for our workplaces and that protect our workers and protect our consumers.", "At the same time, Mr. Speaker, not every regulation on the books is perfect. There are many regulations on the books that are unnecessary. Let’s continue our efforts to reduce those regulations. We’ve gotten rid of 80,000 of them, and the province is the better for it and we haven’t in any way impacted health, safety or the public interest in doing that.", "We will continue that effort, ensuring that our approach is balanced but effective, building a strong economy while ensuring that we protect the interests of each and every Ontarian and their family.", "I’m now going to pass it on to my very able parliamentary assistant." ],

As always, it is a privilege to take part in this long-standing and vital democratic process.", "If you’ll indulge, me, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the minister for his years of hard work and guidance on this important file. Thank you, Minister Duguid.", "From the outset, the minister has made it clear that it is a top priority for the ministry to make Ontario the best place in the world to do business. This is a many-faceted goal, and burden reduction is just one aspect of it. We are proud of the work that has been done in this area.", "I think it is important to stress a point that Minister Duguid made in his introductory remarks: Reducing the burden on businesses does not mean reducing the safeguards that protect the Ontario public.", "The proposed legislative amendments in this act are intended to improve economic efficiency and foster innovation while continuing to provide strong social and environmental protections. We are committed to ensuring that saving businesses time and money does not come at the expense of worker safety and environmental and health standards.", "The preamble of this act states—and I’m going to remind you, Mr. Speaker, that the preamble is legally binding—“Ontario is committed to fostering a strong business climate that supports growth while ensuring appropriate regulatory oversights that protect the public, workers and the environment.", "“Ontario recognizes that modern regulations protect the public interest, including health, safety and the environment, while enabling economic growth, prosperity and a competitive business climate.", "“As a part of Ontario’s regulatory modernization efforts, the province is committed to reducing unnecessary red tape while also ensuring the public interest is protected, and to supporting business needs and ensuring that interactions with government are efficient and straightforward.”", "In short, creating more user-friendly services will actually improve public protections by making it easier for businesses to understand and comply with requirements. It will also make it easier for ministries to focus on what is most important.", "I want to thank the House for this opportunity to once again detail the proposed substance of the Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act, 2017.", "We heard from the minister and we all know that Ontario’s economy is going through a period of generational renewal and modernization. Our traditional sectors are converging with transformative technologies. We must maintain our competitive edge.", "The Business Growth Initiative is our strategy to accelerate a knowledge-based innovation economy and increase the province’s global competitiveness. This five-year, $650-million initiative is guided by the following principles: creating a strong, innovation-driven economy; catapulting more Ontario businesses forward through scaling up; and lowering business costs through modernized regulations.", "The last point is what spurred the writing of this legislation. The Ministry of Economic Development and Growth has introduced a package of legislative amendments that are intended to reduce regulatory burdens and practices that cost businesses time and money while, as I said, protecting environmental and health standards, enhancing work safety and achieving a cost savings for government.", "The process of designing this legislation demanded great coordination and collaboration, and I would like to thank the Open for Business team for their tireless work pulling it all together.", "The ministry worked with five partner ministries and is proposing amendments to more than 40 different statutes. Highlights of the proposed Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act, 2017, include implementing a number of recommendations from the Business Law Advisory Council to update and reform Ontario’s corporate and commercial law statutes; facilitating electronic service delivery and taking steps to enable proclamation of the Not-for-Profit Corporations Act; and enabling automatic electronic service delivery and issuance of pesticide licences if prescribed requirements are met.", "We have taken a holistic evidence-based approach across our ministry and the partner ministries to draft this bill. What we will be voting on is the result of countless hours of research and stakeholder outreach. It was a lot of work, but it was worth it. A smarter regulatory system will enable Ontario to lower business costs and encourage more growth.", "It is time to reckon with outdated, unnecessary or unclear regulations and their compliance requirements. These regulations can take businesses away from important work that creates jobs and grows the economy. The bottom line is that it can cost billions in time and money to complete paperwork, fees and expenses, and this is so true for the small businesses across our province.", "This is the second bill the government has brought forward as part of its commitment to make annual legislative changes that reduce direct and indirect regulatory burdens on Ontario businesses. You will remember that the first annual bill, the Burden Reduction Act, 2017, was passed in March 2017. The act amended more than 50 statutes from 11 different ministries to reduce regulatory burdens and practices that cost businesses time and money while protecting environmental and health standards and enhancing workers’ safety. The amendments will provide Ontario businesses up to $31 million in savings every year.", "I’d like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the burden reduction that will occur across our ministry and our partner ministries should the proposed Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act be passed.", "Schedule 4 of the bill, if passed, would introduce a brand new act called the Reducing Regulatory Costs for Business Act, which contains five new burden initiatives, as follows:", "—a requirement for government to offset new administrative costs imposed on businesses through a reduction in existing costs;", "—a less onerous compliance framework for small business where appropriate;", "—increasing harmonization with other jurisdictions and adopting international or national standards where appropriate when developing or reviewing regulations;", "—the option for businesses to submit documents electronically to the government; and", "—recognizing businesses that have a good compliance record.", "These five initiatives guided the design of the overall bill. They support the Business Growth Initiative by modernizing government lines of business, removing unnecessary regulatory burden and reforming Ontario’s business laws.", "The question of just how much money will be saved by implementing the changes must be addressed. The estimated cost savings were quantified for four of the five proposals above that impacted discrete sectors. It is estimated that businesses impacted by these proposals can realize between $6.3 million to $8.9 million in cost savings.", "As I mentioned, this bill is not just the product of work by the Ministry of Economic Development and Growth. In order to make real change, we had to coordinate with other ministries, and the results, as you will see, are impressive. Here is a short synopsis of the changes that our partner ministries will make. While this list is exhaustive, it should not be considered comprehensive.", "The Ministry of the Attorney General’s proposed changes include amendments to the Charities Accounting Act that would allow charities to make social investments that help further their purposes and achieve a financial return. The amendments will allow charitable organizations to make social investments consistent with their mission by exempting these types of investments from restrictive prudent investor rules.", "Currently, the law is not clear whether charities can make social investments. The amendments will specifically authorizes charities to make such investments. It will give charities more flexibility and another tool to use their assets more effectively. This amendment in particular will position Ontario as the leader in facilitating social investing activities. I should note, as well, that there are a number of safeguards that will be imposed to maintain the public’s trust and confidence in charities.", "As well, a number of amendments will be made to the Courts of Justice Act and the Justices of the Peace Act, including:", "—clarifying that people over the age of 64 may apply to become judges and justices of the peace;", "—designating the Superior Court of Justice to manage complaints against the Small Claims Court administrative judge, including giving the Superior Court of Justice the power to investigate complaints and, if appropriate, discipline the judge for his or her conduct; and", "—making certain tribunal costs orders under the Canadian Free Trade Agreement enforceable as court orders. The change would preserve the ability of Ontario businesses and the Ontario government to challenge trade barriers in other provinces and territories.", "The Notaries Act will be amended to remove the requirement for a non-lawyer notary public to be a Canadian citizen.", "The Juries Act will also be amended to permit electronic options for jurors to return their jury eligibility questionnaires and to receive jury summonses. The deadline for returning a jury questionnaire will be extended from five to 30 days.", "Other technical and housekeeping amendments will be made to modernize outdated wording in French and in English, and to improve accessibility.", "From our partners at the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services there were a number of proposed amendments. The Land Registration Reform Act will be amended to allow electronic registration of survey plans. Electronic submission and registration of plans will reduce the burden on land surveyors, saving these small business owners the time and the cost of registering hard copy plans.", "The Land Titles Act will be amended to allow for a single name to be used to register documents within the land registration system where that single name is permitted under the Vital Statistics Act and the Change of Name Act.", "The proposed amendments to the Business Corporations Act would increase shareholder democracy and increase flexibility in private corporations.

These proposed amendments would increase flexibility, encourage participation in meetings, provide clarity and reduce burdens and costs for not-for-profit corporations.", "The proposed amendments to the Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000 would increase clarity in Ontario’s franchise law, including franchiser and disclosure obligations to prospective franchisees.", "The proposed amendments to the Personal Property Security Act would reduce costs to lenders, lessors and repairers by providing greater certainty.", "The amendments to the Corporations Information Act, and a number of other business law statutes, will facilitate implementation of the new modern business registration system and ensure that related provisions are appropriately aligned, including:", "—modernizing service delivery and enabling electronic access to all modern business registration system services;", "—providing the director with broadened duties and powers to support and implement more efficient and flexible service delivery under a new electronic system; and", "—making amendments to provide greater consistency across the business law statutes and enable a future business law reform agenda.", "The Ministry of Municipal Affairs proposed amendments to the Municipal Elections Act that would provide clarity that compliance audit committees, established in all municipalities across the province prior to municipal elections, may deliberate in private for the purpose of making decisions; and provide more consistency across the province; and may also prevent the use of “stock” written decisions that are prepared in advance due to the inability of compliance audit committee members to meet and speak in private.", "I should add that the above issue has been raised by a number of municipalities recently. As well, the issue was raised by the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, AMO. AMO takes the position that a legislative change is required to address this issue.", "Our partners at the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change proposed amendments to the Pesticides Act. These would:", "—transition the pesticide licensing program from paper-based to online service delivery;", "—allow licences to be issued automatically online if prescribed requirements are met; and", "—eliminate approximately 5,200 paper-based applications the ministry receives each year, providing a faster, more efficient way to get a licence.", "The proposed amendments to the Environmental Protection Act will allow the ministry to make certain information about pesticide licences publicly available online, supporting a transparent and open government.", "To respond to business needs while maintaining environmental protection, the ministry is implementing an ongoing transformational agenda, using a risk-based approach while reducing regulatory burden on businesses and enhancing program service delivery.", "For the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the proposal is for the appointment of multiple vice-chairs to the Normal Farm Practices Protection Board. This amendment would increase the board’s capacity to manage the hearing process. It would shorten wait times for hearings by alleviating the burden of only having two members capable of chairing a hearing. And it would shorten wait times for decisions by alleviating the burden of only having two members capable of writing decisions.", "The reason behind all of these amendments is straightforward: It is to improve economic efficiency and foster innovation, while continuing to provide strong social and environmental protections. The list of proposed amendments are, at their heart, about reducing regulatory burden by eliminating duplication, decreasing unnecessary regulatory requirements and improving government services to save businesses time, money and resources, and make it easier and less expensive to run a business in Ontario.", "Of course, the measures I just detailed are only some of the burden-reduction activities the government is undertaking. There is a lot more that is being done in this area. As I mentioned, it is a key pillar of the Business Growth Initiative and as such has been a top priority for our ministry.", "At this point, I think it would be instructive to take a look at some of the other burden reduction efforts we have undertaken.", "We have committed to releasing an annual burden reduction report. The report profiles initiatives that are reducing burdens and making it easier for business and other stakeholders to succeed, including providing more online services, simplifying processes and modernizing regulation. The latest annual report, released on June 27, 2017, features an estimated savings of $152 million and 6.5 million hours to businesses and other external stakeholders since 2011. This surpasses, by more than 50%, the government’s target of saving $100 million by the end of 2017.", "As a ministry, we also conducted Open for Business round tables in 10 sectors and addressed 50 priority items, including:", "—a reduction in length of the WSIB No Lost Time form, form 7, by 60%;", "—standardized food premises inspection reporting and food handler training programs;", "—speeding up water-taking permits for low-impact construction and road-building projects; and", "—streamlining the number of permits required for development of residential subdivisions.", "We are also implementing measures, under Ontario’s regulatory policy, to ensure new regulations are well developed and avoid imposing unnecessary costs on business. Tools and processes include:", "—a regulatory impact analysis, to ensure costs and benefits of significant regulations are understood before regulations are approved;", "—a mandatory review policy, to ensure that outdated or redundant regulations with high impact on businesses are regularly revisited, and amended or eliminated if necessary;", "—twice-annual effective dates, to make Ontario’s business climate more predictable by requiring new regulations affecting business to come into effect twice a year, on January 1 and July 1, so businesses can plan ahead; and", "—a regulatory registry, to make business regulations more transparent by allowing 45 days for comments on new regulatory proposals. In 2016, there were approximately 400,000 visitors to the site, and 232 postings, which include regulatory proposals and discussion papers, and 1,054 comments received from the public.", "In conclusion, after third reading, if passed, the Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act, 2017, will be an important part of our ongoing efforts to make Ontario the best and easiest place in the world to do business.", "Nothing gives me more pride, and nothing makes me more proud, than when I get to travel this province on behalf of Minister Duguid, representing our government, to hear the various businesses from various sectors talking about how impressed they are that their company objectives are very much in line with those of this government, and that we all want the best for the businesses in our province, and that is to make life easier for them, especially those small businesses, and to ensure that we continue to attract the businesses that continue to make Ontario the best place to live, work and play.", "I often ask this question of those I meet when I travel the province—because when you’re in this House, you hear so many different things. I often ask them, “So tell me: Is it true or is it not true that businesses are moving out of the province, businesses are leaving Ontario?” They laugh at me, Mr. Speaker, and say, “Christina, nothing is further from the truth.” We continue to grow our businesses here in Ontario; we continue to attract highly skilled workers here in Ontario; and we continue to attract the investments that we need to make sure that our province continues to grow.", "Just earlier this month, I was in Guelph. I was at Linamar for a very special graduation that evening. They said to me, “You know what, Christina? We went from 5,000 employees here in our company, and within eight years, we’ve doubled the number of employees.” They are at 10,000 employees right now at Linamar.", "So it is always good to get out there and visit people and businesses across this province to—" ],

The government members should recognize that we have lost hundreds of thousands of well-paying manufacturing jobs in the province, jobs that have been lost at Ford Talbotville; I think of Wescast Industries in my riding, in Strathroy; Caterpillar and Heinz in southwestern Ontario; General Electric—the list goes on and on and on. These were 400,000 well-paying jobs.", "I’ll talk about this, Mr. Speaker, but in this piece of legislation, it doesn’t actually go far enough. By the government’s own numbers, they’re going to save businesses between $6 million and $8 million per year. This is when third-party studies have shown that red tape is costing businesses $14 billion. So it’s a very small amount. The government could have taken further action.", "But the other things affecting employment in the province, Mr. Speaker, besides red tape, are that we have ever-growing debt in the province, electricity bills—we saw in the long-term energy plan that bills are set to go up even further in the years ahead—and also the minimum wage hike. I know that all MPPs are hearing from small businesses and the non-profits in their communities about the impact on jobs that the minimum wage hike is going to have. I’m looking forward to debating this bill further." ],

He called those concerns off-base. He dismissed those concerns.

I would also say that I think it’s a kind of applied intelligence, with reference to this bill, about the $1—for example, if a new regulation incurs $1 of cost in implementing it, there will be an offset of $1.25.", "I can engage the honourable member from Lanark and other names there—I appreciate his definition of whether it was necessary red tape or unnecessary red tape.

I’d like to read just a small excerpt from the report that summarizes why this is a problem in need of a much more comprehensive solution:", "“Ontario is a great place to live and work, but the foundation of our prosperity is shifting. Through extensive research, we have identified several factors that limit business growth in the province, from lacklustre exports to an elevated cost of living to decreased labour force participation. These factors, coupled with high input costs such as rising electricity prices, a cap-and-trade regime, onerous labour law reforms and a burdensome regulatory environment, mean the cost of doing business in Ontario is high relative to our competitor jurisdictions.” I know this is something I’ve raised many times, and many in our caucus have raised the same concern, that Ontario is a more expensive place to do business, to grow a business and to create jobs.", "The report goes on to more specifically address the impact of the province’s burdensome regulatory environment, saying, “Overregulation imposes the equivalent of an additional 5% to 15% import tariff on small businesses compared to larger firms, due to small firms’ inability to appropriately navigate the regulatory environment. With 380,000 regulations (by the government’s own count), Ontario is the most administered province in the country, harming business competitiveness.”", "Speaker, just to reiterate, this report by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce called Vote Prosperity says, “With 380,000 regulations ... Ontario is the most administered province in the country, harming business competitiveness.” That’s shameful, Mr. Speaker, especially when this government has had 14 years to truly reduce the regulatory environment for the business community in Ontario. That’s a deeply troubling analysis.", "The government, through regulation, is imposing a 5% to 15% penalty to small businesses. Most small businesses are working with pretty fine margins, especially those that are just starting out. What a discouraging message for them to receive about how burdensome and demanding regulation is of their resources, and all the more so when their larger competitors don’t have the same issue. This is a hidden tax on small business and it is another issue of fairness and an example of this government’s policies disproportionately impacting the little guys.", "This is not the message we want to send when we’re trying to encourage people to start and grow businesses in the province of Ontario. If we want innovators to go into business, we need to allow them to focus on their business and what they’re good at, not drown them out in paperwork and siphon away precious resources.", "This bill proposes that future regulations be sensitive to the constraints of small business. It sets out that, where appropriate, government should have less onerous compliance requirements to apply to small businesses. Speaker, we all know the stats. This province has over 407,000 small businesses, and over 87% of people in Ontario are employed by small or medium-sized businesses. They are absolutely vital to our economy and our province’s success. Responsible governance requires a consideration of cost versus benefit, and accountable governance requires that the public has some idea of how the government is spending their money. Too often, this is simply not the case here in Ontario.", "It’s great that this is in the bill, but I find it incredibly discouraging that the government is only just now going to start being sensitive to small business resource limitations. These businesses have different issues and different risks, and they have been particularly hard hit by this government as they struggle to bear the cost of electricity and the sudden, rapid rise in minimum wage.", "Most are already running as lean as they possibly can with the minimum of staff, so pulling a manager or a business owner away from their regular work is a real burden. Unfortunately, this is another case where Bill 154 doesn’t actually do anything. It relies entirely on the government having good follow-through. I would like to hear from the minister how he intends to monitor the success of this proposal, or from other ministers about how they might implement this. Because my fear is that this is an idea that will live and die within the confines of a Ministry of Economic Development press release.", "Reducing red tape is something I believe strongly in. Red tape is one of the key issues our party is committed to addressing, because we recognize that unnecessary and complex regulations not only add costs, but they create a disincentive for new and expanding investment decisions.", "In the Canadian Federation of Independent Business’ most recent report on business confidence, they have reported for Ontario that “short-term hiring plans have become negative for the first time since the end of 2013 with one in five business owners looking to layoff staffing while 15% are looking to hire. About 43% of business owners say their firms are in good shape, while 9% are in bad shape.”", "One of the reasons I bring up red tape reduction time and time again is because it really is one of the most equitable ways in which we can create a more competitive business environment here in Ontario. So many of the initiatives this government undertakes are to help out a chosen few, leaving other businesses that are just as likely to succeed in a free market scenario at a disadvantage. For example, they pile on costs by adopting cap-and-trade, but then don’t allow low-emitting small and medium-sized businesses to offset those costs with credits for their efficiencies. They introduced the industrial conservation initiative program to help high-energy-use manufacturers reduce their hydro bills; again, another initiative that helps a select few to cope with energy costs, while leaving the small and medium-sized businesses to fend for themselves. Or they hand out grants to select companies that are, in effect, funded by the taxes paid by their competitors. Having the government pick winners and losers like this is simply not a fair or effective economic development strategy. Every business should have the opportunity to succeed in Ontario.", "The Fraser Institute recently reported on the way in which different jurisdictions compete for investment. This article was precipitated by Amazon’s announcement of plans to open a second North American headquarters, which has led to a lot of jockeying for advantage from cities across Canada and the United States.

It shouldn’t be government’s job to pick winners and losers.", "“Governments can also reduce the regulatory burden on business. More red tape—found in approval processes, zoning codes and permits—faced by entrepreneurs means more resources allocated to regulatory compliance and less allocated to growing their businesses. By streamlining or reducing regulation, government can help firms focus on what matters—creating jobs and growing the economy.", "“These moves may not be as politically attractive as public grandstanding, but in the long run, they attract business investment and jobs. They can also help even the playing field between small businesses and larger ones, as larger businesses are better resourced to navigate complex regulations. Rather than helping today’s corporate giants, why not encourage tomorrow’s?”", "What I found very interesting is that Ed Clark, the Premier’s appointee, seems to agree. Despite the Liberal record of handing out big grants to hand-selected companies, the man they have appointed to lead the greater Toronto region’s effort to lure Amazon to the GTA was reported by the Globe and Mail to have said, “Providing large taxpayer subsidies to the firm wouldn’t be fair to other companies that have set up shop in Ontario with little or no government assistance.”", "Speaker, that article goes on to say, “‘The region’s bid to Amazon founder ... will highlight other strengths such as the province’s skilled workforce,’ Clark said, adding that the province would be willing to make other contributions like helping the company secure land.", "“‘There are clearly places in the United States that will, I use the word, bribe, people to come,’ he said. ‘(They) say you just tell us what cheque you want us to write, we will write that cheque. We’re not in that business.’", "“If that’s what Amazon is looking for, Ontario will not win, said Clark....”", "Speaker, I have a long record in this House of saying very much the same thing. We need to be creating a level playing field and making Ontario the best place to do business, period—not for a hand-picked few, not for the pet causes of the government of the day. We need to be the best place for any company that wants to do business.", "As legislators, we should be working to ensure that Ontario’s businesses are able to compete on an equal footing at home and that they aren’t working at a disadvantage to the companies based out of other jurisdictions, which is an area in which this government has fallen down. Our businesses are paying more for energy than their competitors, they wait longer for approvals, and they have a government that keeps throwing them curveballs like the threat, at one point, of the ORPP or cap-and-trade or the sudden hike in the minimum wage.", "Given that this Liberal government has been in power for almost 15 years, you would think businesses would at least be able to expect some stability. This is an important factor, because when you have a chaotic regulatory environment, it increases the perception of risk. If businesses and families feel there is uncertainty in the market, then they’re going to be less likely to spend disposable income or invest in equipment or take on new workers.", "The Ontario chamber has raised concerns about this as well, saying, “The BPI is currently near a 15-year high. Unfortunately, this is not an indication of production prosperity, but a perception of fewer opportunities and higher risk.... This has led to a preference for the maintenance of ... operations ... rather than growth”—and the accumulation of financial flexibility.", "I had the opportunity a couple of weeks ago, as did the Minister of Economic Development, to address the Chemical Industry Association of Canada. Their industry is really an interesting one to look at in terms of the trends they’re experiencing, because I think there are some very worrying indications about Ontario’s ability to attract investment. I know my colleague from Sarnia–Lambton has raised this issue a number of times as well.", "To start with, this is an industry that is experiencing growth and success in North America. Many of the companies in that industry are multinational, which is increasingly common across industries. It is a shift that has changed the nature of competition for new investment capital between different jurisdictions. In a multinational company, you’re competing within your own organization, often against US-based facilities. When that sort of competition takes place within an organization, it’s a very direct comparison between jurisdictions.", "We’ve all heard stories about companies waiting months and years to bring new machinery into use because of red tape and bureaucratic delays. Just imagine how that sort of unnecessary delay looks to a multinational company weighing a decision about where to expand operations.", "Let’s look at the evidence in the case of the chemistry industry; what has that more direct comparison yielded? Unfortunately, the result has been our share of North American investment activity diminishing. Before 2010, the average sat at around 10%, but since that time it has been dropping. That’s a trend our Conservative caucus wants to see turn around. There’s great success being enjoyed on the other side of the border thanks to the chemistry industry. I understand that in the current business cycle, the CIAC’s American peer association is tracking 300 global-scale chemistry investments worth over $250 billion—those are in US dollars, Speaker—and 70% of that is foreign direct investment. That doesn’t even account for the additional 700 investments in the downstream plastics sector. That is growth we need to attract here in Ontario, and I know the CIAC is working hard to bring it here, but government needs to be working to make sure they have the best possible opportunity to do that.", "The World Bank, in their Doing Business 2017 report, ranked countries based on how business friendly their regulatory systems are. Canada ranked 22nd, putting us behind countries like the US, the UK, Australia, Iceland, New Zealand and Denmark. Ontario, obviously, has a disproportionate weight when Canada is considered as a whole, and so I think that statistic also speaks to the need to make improvements right here in our province. Companies should be dedicating resources to developing their businesses, not complying with unnecessary or redundant regulations.", "Steven Globerman, writing for the Fraser Forum, looked at issues the United States has had around over-regulation and issued this warning for us here on the other side of the border:", "“One prominent potential explanation of the US productivity slowdown is government regulation. The accumulation of such regulations diverts productive resources that might be used for other purposes such as research and development and capital investment in order to fulfill regulatory obligations. This diversion can contribute to slower productivity growth and reduced overall real economic growth.", "“Indeed, a recent study published by the Mercatus Center covering 22 US industries over the period 1977-2012 found that federal government regulations—by distorting investment choices that lead to innovation—created a drag on the US economy amounting to an average reduction in the annual growth rate of the US gross domestic product of 0.8%. If regulations had been held constant at levels observed in 1980, US per capita income would be more than $13,000 higher than it is currently.", "“The US productivity experience should be a cautionary tale for legislators everywhere, including Canada. Regulations are difficult to remove once implemented, as they create groups in society with vested interests in preserving regulations that shield those groups from direct or indirect competition. The available evidence suggests that there is a potentially large economic payoff to eliminating regulations that have net social costs, as well as to forbearing from implementing new regulations with unfavourable benefit-cost ratios.”", "Obviously, the health and safety of the people of Ontario is our foremost concern here when we consider legislation, and the Minister of Economic Development made that quite clear. I believe that bureaucracy holds to that same standard. If that’s not the case, then we have a much larger problem on our hands here in Ontario. But I truly believe that everyone within the different ministries will ensure that health and safety exists for workers in the province.", "Considering cost and benefits of new regulations should not be a scary prospect; it’s a very basic level of accountability to expect. We have more regulations in Ontario than in any other Canadian jurisdiction, so I think it’s alarmist to say that the minute we start to pare that down, we’re going to end up with a health crisis. If that’s the case, there would have to be a lot of other things that are broken in the system and across government.", "Speaker, during the second reading debate, I listened with interest to what many of my colleagues from the NDP had to say. They seem to be of two minds about this bill, on the one hand saying it doesn’t accomplish much and that many of these changes are overdue, but also saying that it’s extremely dangerous to cut regulations, and urging the government to create stronger regulations. Reading between the lines, I think the heart of the issue they have around health and safety concerns is not that the regulations are inadequate, but that they are inadequately enforced.", "I think that’s a legitimate concern. There are many very necessary health and safety regulations, but the failure to enforce these necessary regulations is often the result of a lack of resources, which is really why we need to separate the wheat from the chaff here, so the focus can be on the bad actors and the critical situations instead of on the enforcement of some of these regulations.", "That’s one of the reasons I wholeheartedly support the proposed initiative to reward compliance. If a business is consistently compliant, then it doesn’t serve anybody to have inspectors keep showing up every two months to that plant, for example. Better that they come every four or six months, which would mean that company doesn’t have to devote as many resources to proving compliance, and that inspector can spend more time focusing on companies that have a record of failing to meet standards. That’s a win for compliant companies, for the government and for workers.", "Speaker, it’s another idea which is very good in principle but, again, the language of the bill—that ministries should “recognize businesses that demonstrate excellent compliance”—is extremely vague. I know there are too many programs and particulars for the details of such recognition to be explicitly laid out, but it leaves businesses once again to just wish and hope that this will lead to something useful. I would like to hear from some of the members on the opposite side, in the government, on what their plans are for putting this particular directive into action.", "Along the same lines, Bill 154 will make electronic document filing the default, with exceptions being made on a case-by-case basis. Specifically, it lays out that when a business is required, for any reason, to submit documents to a ministry of the government of Ontario in order to comply with a regulation, they may, at the option of the business, submit the documents electronically. I think most people would assume that this would already be the norm here in Ontario. In this day and age, this shouldn’t be a measure a government is introducing with fanfare. This is just a rare application of common sense by this government, I suppose, and that’s enough to get everyone excited.", "But even this step is not all it might appear to be. In fact, this is really just a suggestion to the ministries, and the government isn’t able to say how broadly it might actually be applied.", "I understand that while this legislation is being considered, the Ministry of Economic Development is working concurrently with the other ministries in government to implement this, but they can’t say how widely electronic document submission will actually be used.", "I haven’t heard yet from any ministers who intend to take sweeping action as a result of this directive. I hope maybe to hear some specific examples as we continue the debate of this bill during third reading.", "Again, Speaker, it’s a nice thought. It’s more than reasonable, and something I think most people would take for granted as already being in place. But I hope this will in fact be broadly applied and actually become the norm of the government of Ontario. It’s a good measure, but we’ll have to wait to see whether this proposal has any substantive impact.", "Ontario businesses are struggling with input costs. That’s what you hear over and over when you talk directly to business owners and managers, from related reports and organizations: the cost of energy, the cost of labour, rising taxes and fees.", "CFIB conservatively estimated that regulations cost Ontario’s businesses upwards of $15 billion back in 2014, a figure that had been steadily on the rise for the 10 years prior to that—all under this government, of course, under Dalton McGuinty and now Premier Wynne.", "Bill 154, an omnibus bill which runs almost 200 pages, is only offering the entirety of the private sector between $6.3 million and almost $9 million in cost savings.

That’s now being topped off with concerns about NAFTA and their ability to buy, sell and compete across the border.", "A substantive effort to make it easier and less expensive for these companies to comply with regulation could have gone a little way to show Ontario’s business community that the government isn’t actively working against them. That is the impression that many speakers have at this point in time, whether I’m out meeting with a local family farm or a small business. My background—and I know other members of this House come from a small-business background—you often feel that government is out to get you, that they’re against you. Whether it’s the energy costs in Ontario, the sudden minimum wage hike that caught every not-for-profit and small business in the province off guard, or what the federal Liberal government is doing, the business community in Ontario just doesn’t feel appreciated.", "The Minister of Economic Development likes to tout his accolades from CFIB, but it bears mentioning what they’re actually praising, which in their 2017 report was the introduction of the Red Tape Challenge and consulting with two sectors. The CFIB also mentions that the government has received hundreds of submissions covering more than 200 regulations. To me that reads more like a lot of talk from the government and conclusive evidence that there’s a strong appetite for red tape reduction from Ontario’s businesses.", "The number of regulations in this province and the economic toll that they take have been steadily increasing since this Liberal government came to power in 2003. Their record is pretty clear at this point. They like to talk a lot about getting rid of red tape, but all that comes from it is a bill like this, which has some nice ideas but no real mechanism to enforce them and which makes a bunch of little technical amendments and inconsequential changes.", "I would like to take the time now—this was brought forward at committee, but I would like to highlight, once again, the efforts of my colleague from Leeds–Grenville, MPP Steve Clark, who has been working to cut red tape for car dealers. He introduced a private member’s bill a year ago, the Cutting Red Tape for Motor Vehicle Dealers Act, 2016, and reintroduced it as Bill 3 after prorogation. His bill would have amended the Highway Traffic Act to allow registered motor vehicle dealers to use electronic means to apply for a permit, number plates or a validation for a vehicle, to apply for a new permit for a vehicle, or to apply for a used-vehicle information package. It would have allowed the Minister of Transportation to monitor the success of the program and add more services to the list through regulation. This would have helped Ontario’s 1,000 new car dealers save time and money and given them the tools to provide better customer service.", "We tried to get this passed as an amendment to Bill 154, since it’s a straightforward measure—a lot of common sense here—and very much in keeping with the stated intent of this bill. But unfortunately, we weren’t able to get that through at committee, which is really a shame because it would have given at least someone some immediate and tangible benefit from Bill 154, this particular bill.", "One group this bill really isn’t doing anything for is our farmers. I would like to highlight one specific concern I’ve heard from farmers in my riding in particular, and that’s the paperwork associated with neonics. Whatever you might think about neonics, I don’t think anybody wants farmers having to take days and days away from their work to fill out forms. It’s a concern that is summed up well in this article from Farmers Forum written by Tom Collins:", "“Western Ontario: Angered by hours of neonic paperwork: Expect one hour of paperwork for every 100 acres—many more hours to test for insects.", "“Kent county”—Speaker, I’m going to read this article: “New and controversial provincial seed regulations mean that some farmers spend days filling out the needed paperwork to be allowed to use insecticide seed treatments called neonicotinoids this spring.", "“Trevor Crowe, of Reynolds Farms in eastern Ontario, spent about 40 hours filling out the forms for 4,000 acres. That didn’t include the half-day course required to use neonics or the actual scouting for pests. His father Lloyd did the scouting, which added several weeks and many hours as Lloyd had to dig the government-required five holes for every 100 acres—that’s 800 holes over 4,000 acres—to set bait for wireworms and grubs.", "“‘You can tell somebody from the city wrote (the regulations),’ said Trevor. ‘They didn’t really think of the actual scope of work that would be required to implement something like this. It’s just not realistic at all for our size of farm.’", "“Most farmers report that it has taken about an hour of paperwork for every 100 acres.", "“Ontario provincial regulations came into effect last year that require farmers to conduct pest assessments before being allowed to use neonic-treated corn and soybean seeds on more than 50% of their fields in 2016. Farmers will need a pest assessment on all fields that use neonics starting in 2017 with the goal of an 80% reduction. Almost all of the corn seeds in Ontario and 60% of soybean seeds were previously treated with neonics. The province argues that neonics are killing honeybees. The Grain Farmers of Ontario (GFO) says the province is short on science and is siding with environmentalists.", "“Mark Thomson, who farms with his brother Joe at Parkhill,” in the great riding of Lambton–Kent–Middlesex, “estimated it would take about 40 hours to fill out the paperwork for his 4,500 acres including custom work.", "“‘It’s a pain in the ass,’ he said. ‘It’s just going to be another thing you’ve got to sit in your office and do. It’s more paperwork, and there’s enough paperwork already. These are all going to go to OMAFRA. They’re going to be thrown in the corner, and probably nobody’s going to look at them....’", "“GFO director Mark Huston wasn’t finished the paperwork by February 1, but said a conservative estimate is it would take him 10 hours....", "“Huston said farmers are frustrated by the amount of work. One of Huston’s fields is about 115 acres but has three roll numbers, meaning he had to dig 15 holes on those acres. In total, he had to scout about 900 acres....", "“Estimates are that 80% to 90% of farmers had not submitted any neonic documents by late January. Farmers that don’t use neonic seed don’t need to fill out forms, which are submitted online or given to their seed dealer.", "“Pioneer sales rep Leo Guilbeault spent about three hours on paperwork for his almost 2,000 acres, but said it’s taking more time to help customers.", "“‘I was surprised how many guys out there hadn’t even heard of it,’ he said. ‘I’ve done mine, but everybody else needs help, so that’s even more work. That’s my project for the whole month of February. We try to encourage everybody to get it done now because it’s easier now when we have time to deal with it than come springtime when everybody is in more of a hurry and the last thing you want to do is sit at a desk filling in paperwork when you can be outside in the workshop....’", "“Guilbeault said this is a good time to be doing the paperwork, before planting season begins.", "“‘We can’t legally deliver their seeds until they deliver us the paperwork,’ he said. ‘It’s in our best interests to make sure that gets done. I don’t want to have to deal with that in the spring when it’s seed delivery time.’", "“GFO chair Mark Brock still had to do about half the paperwork at the start of February. He estimated it would take about six to 10 hours, or a 40-hour week when you add in the scouting for pests.”", "Speaker, I think this example speaks clearly to the need for this government to stop legislating from the Queen’s Park bubble and make a concerted effort to actually understand the impact that their regulations will have. On the neonics issue, I’d like to remind the government, in particular, that it was a downtown Toronto Minister of the Environment who legislated this on farmers across the province. I think this article summed up the struggles best. And the Minister of the Environment who was that minister is out somewhere advocating for this probably across the country.", "As I said, governments need to stop legislating from the Queen’s Park bubble so they can understand the impact that their regulations are having on everyday people.", "You can almost liken the trend this article speaks to as being similar to the Laffer curve: When regulatory compliance becomes too demanding, compliance may very well drop off. That’s not in anyone’s interest either. It’s why transparency and accountability are so important. It helps get the buy-in that leads to actual compliance.", "One of the measures proposed in Bill 154 proposes a small measure of increased transparency by mandating that associated costs of new regulations will be published when a proposed regulatory requirement is posted to the regulatory registry. This is another case where most people probably assumed that the economic impact of a government proposal would exist and be available when that regulation is published for public comment, but somehow this is a brand new concept for this current government.", "I have questions around this for the minister, though: how comprehensive this evaluation of costs might be, for example. When these sorts of numbers come from the government, with often a significant gap between what is projected and what the reality is, does the time it takes to ensure compliance have any weight, for example? Filling out a form might look like the cost of paper, but it can represent hours and hours of productive time lost, as we heard in the article that I just read.", "To be credible, this needs to be transparent. If there’s one thing this government needs, it’s more transparency. I’ve long called on this ministry to become more transparent when it comes to handing out billions of dollars in corporate grants, and I’ve been on the record demanding that this Liberal government release all corporate grant recipients going back to 2004. We’re still continuing that fight, but I would urge the Premier to release all corporate grants in this province so people can see who got that money—not just economic development grants, but grants handed out for the purpose through ministries such as Northern Development, and Agriculture and Rural Affairs. There’s a lot of money that flows out of the government and into private sector hands with very little to no accountability.", "Of course, one of the reasons is because we know, according to the Auditor General, that 80% of the money that was given to corporations by the economic development ministry was done on an invitation-only basis. Bureaucrats or politicians were inviting companies to apply for corporate grants. We still don’t know how that process unfolded. The government has not been forthcoming about how companies were selected, and as far as I know, there have been no changes to that process since the Auditor General’s report. Then, secondly, 96% of all that money has been given out to corporations that are the largest and most successful companies in Ontario. We need transparency as well when it comes to corporate grants handed out by the Liberals.", "Meanwhile in the public sector, there’s an example out of Caledon that I know our leader has mentioned, but I don’t think we can overemphasize how absurd this situation is. The Winston Churchill road bridge, or large box culvert, needed replacing. To accomplish this—what you assume would be a straightforward project, replacing a bridge that already exists—the government required EA studies that cost $800,000. The government required a study that cost $800,000; the construction itself was only $600,000. Does that sound like a good use of infrastructure money?", "A related concern was brought to my attention around the Municipal Class Environmental Assessment, or MCEA process. I know the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change has had this issue brought to him as well, but unfortunately nothing has really been done to address these concerns. By way of explanation, MCEAs are required for infrastructure projects such as new local roads, widening roads, cycling lanes, bridge replacements, culverts, sewer systems and new or altered traffic intersections.", "The Residential and Civil Construction Alliance of Ontario has been sounding the alarm on this expensive and time-consuming process for years. I will share with the House the results of the independent research reports they commissioned on whether the MCEAs are worthwhile. They found three areas of major concern.", "The first one was cost: A class EA report’s price tripled in many places, rising to about $386,500, up from $113,300 four years previously.", "Time: It took 26.7 months to go through the process, seven months longer than it took four years previously.", "Duplication: Some projects can have two public consultation processes, one through the Planning Act and the second through the MCEA process, extending construction timelines unnecessarily.", "As a result, RCCAO is teaming up with the Municipal Engineers Association to prepare a section 61 Environmental Bill of Rights application to be submitted to Ontario’s Environmental Commissioner for consideration. With results like this, I think the onus is on the ministry to show that this process is effective.", "AMO recently conducted a test case in the city of London, attempting to alleviate the burden of lengthy environmental approvals. They described the repercussions of that burden in their report, saying, “To enable expansion of commercial enterprises and residential construction, physical infrastructure is a pre-condition. Since in business, ’time is money,’ inordinate and unnecessary delays discourage business investment.", "“Delays in securing ECAs result in costly delays and carrying costs for those developing properties for commercial purposes. Delays also mean deferring the date on which economic activity begins and new or expanded properties are added to the tax rolls. In the case of residential and mixed-use developments, delays reduce the supply of new housing and construction sector employment.”", "The solution they devised was as follows: “The strategy combined improving internal processes, engaging applicants at an early stage, and finally, working with Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change officials to expand the scope of delegation to city staff by the MOECC....", "“If the application meets statutory and operational conditions, the municipality’s professional staff prepares a ‘draft certificate of approval’ supporting the application. Municipal officials then submit the application with a ‘letter of recommendation’ to the MOECC for final processing and approval. In this process, municipalities recommend but do not approve ECAs. The ministry retains authority for issuing ECA approvals under the OWRA and the EPA. However, the technical review is done locally, thus reducing the burden on MOECC staff and accelerating the MOECC phase of the process....", "“As a result, the waiting time for ECAs on good development proposals is reduced for business applicants from as much as 36 weeks for ‘direct submission’ applications, to an average of four weeks for ‘transfer of review’ applications, a time saving of 32 weeks, or nearly 90%.”", "So we’ve got these different groups and stakeholders coming to the government not just with red tape problems but with solutions to those problems in hand, and they’re still going nowhere. Stakeholders have actually written to the minister to clearly voice the frustration they have about this not being dealt with for years on end. I would like to quote from this letter, Speaker:", "“As you know, the Auditor General’s 2016 annual report contained a value-for-money audit of environmental assessments. Bonnie Lysyk pointed out that an EA advisory panel made recommendations for reform in 2005 but that these had not been acted upon. Expectations are thus high that tangible action will be taken now.”", "It’s an example of why I’m skeptical about the government enacting the measures included in this bill, Bill 154. Here is a problem that concerned parties have been telling the Liberal government about since they got into office, but they’re still waiting for action—nearly 15 years.", "The same letter highlights concerns around delays in completing part II order or bump-up requests related to MCEA projects. It goes on to say:", "“In 2014, our data show that the ministry took 148 to 561 days to review bump-up requests for MCEA projects. This is unacceptable, particularly when the province has for many years boasted that it is making strides to modernize approvals. Clearly this challenge has not been meaningfully addressed by MOECC. Part II order delays add an extra year or more in many cases as the completion of public consultation and final report often takes more than two years to complete. An improvement such as a bridge replacement to comply with current transportation safety standards could mean a continuation of unacceptable safety risks to the public or delays in access to emergency services and goods movement. Delays to these types of municipal infrastructure projects also prohibit community-building efforts and diminish economic activity. When projects finally do proceed, the cost of the project often increases, thereby necessitating further delays to obtain council approval for additional capital funds.”", "With those types of concerns on the table, I think the minister owes a fulsome explanation for why he is maintaining the status quo. If the way the MCEA process is currently functioning is somehow the best possible solution in his mind or the ministry’s mind, then he needs to look for ways to expedite it and he needs to be up front with the parties in the communities that are fed up with what they see as needless delays and red tape.", "I think this is also probably an example of why we need to pare down red tape to free up resources for enforcement and administration of the really necessary regulations. The reality which underpins all of this is the debt that this government has run up. The province’s debt has surpassed $300 billion for the first time in Ontario’s history. It has been said many times before, but it’s worth saying again that we are now the most indebted sub-sovereign borrower. There isn’t a state or province in the world that owes as much as we do here in Ontario.", "The interest payments on the debt alone are costing almost $1 billion each and every month. That is money taken from families and businesses which they can no longer use to invest in growth or even just to cover rising electricity bills. This reality is distorting our economic decisions. It lays a punishing weight on both families and businesses. It’s something I know my constituents feel, whether at home or at work, from higher prices for gasoline to more expensive natural gas to rising licence fees.", "I’ve talked a lot about the costs that red tape imposes on business, but it’s important to note as well this takes a toll on family budgets. Ultimately, whatever costs red tape imposes on businesses, it trickles down to individuals, whether it’s through wage stagnation or increased product prices. Sometimes government is taking money directly from citizens’ pockets. We always have to be conscientious that there is one taxpayer, and however money is collected or wasted, it’s coming from the same place.", "CFIB has done a report on this as well. I’m just going to read you some points from their summary:", "“From filing taxes to applying for government permits, how much does red tape cost you? Our report quantifies, for the first time, the cost of some of the most common red tape headaches for ordinary Canadians.", "“At least $10 billion a year, and a lot of stress. The report entitled Impact of Regulation on Canadian Individuals for the first time quantifies the cost of the most common red tape headaches faced by ordinary Canadians. The $10-billion figure takes into account the following:", "“—complying with personal income tax obligations ($6.7 billion, excluding actual taxes paid);", "“—applying for and renewing passports ($645 million);", "“—applying for and renewing driver’s licences and vehicle registrations ($1.7 billion); and", "“—time spent complying with these and other regulatory obligations (excluding personal income taxes).", "“Businesses and consumers alike are both affected by red tape. Government rules, permits and paperwork are involved in everything from renovating a home to applying for a student loan to going fishing. CFIB has previously pegged the direct cost of regulation on Canadian businesses at $31 billion per year. The data on cost to individuals begins to provide a fuller picture of the total cost of regulation for Canadians.", "“The report also includes a public opinion poll in which almost half of the respondents said that excessive regulation adds significant stress to their lives.”", "I don’t see this government doing anything to address this. Taxes and fees have been going up: From licences to natural gas bills to fuel for people’s cars, people are paying more and getting less.", "CFIB is talking about Canadians in that report, but, again, there’s only one taxpayer, and they deserve to have government give consideration to the economic reality that they’re actually facing.", "I want to circle back to my primary concern with this bill, which is that there’s no mechanism in this piece of legislation for ensuring that follow-through will be here. I’d very much like to hear from the government how they plan to track the impact of this bill’s directives: the requirement of $1.25 in savings be found for every $1 in new regulatory costs; sensitivity to small business resource limitations; greater harmonization with national and international standards; rewarding compliance; and increasing the validation of electronic document filing and communications.", "I’d like to hear from the government how they plan to get ministry staff engaged on these initiatives. How will we know what results they’re yielding across different ministries? These are very common-sense policies, and the fact that they weren’t already in place makes me wonder how entrenched the current culture is within the bureaucracy. What efforts is the Ministry of Economic Development going to make to ensure there is uptake? I know the minister is finished with his lead, but I think it would be very reassuring to hear from the government about what the next steps will be if this bill is enacted.", "Ontario is succeeding because of its people. We succeed because of our people. We know it here in this House and we see it in our ridings. We hear that from Ed Clark, who that said the people of this province are its best asset and the greatest enticement we can offer Amazon. You hear it from Forbes, which highlighted that Toronto has “some of the world’s best and brightest innovators.”", "This government should not take our human capital for granted. When Alberta was booming, we were losing a lot of talented and hard-working people who decided to head west. Human capital is mobile. It can sustain prosperity for a time, but it’s not fixed, and the government should not confuse the success it brings with sound economic policy.", "I’m honoured to do my one-hour lead on behalf of the PC caucus. I look forward to the debate in the days ahead on this bill. I know the critic for the third party will be doing her one-hour lead shortly.", "I would encourage the government to really think outside of the bubble of Queen’s Park. Again, coming from a small business background, like some of my colleagues, when you’re sitting at this desk at Queen’s Park, you don’t realize the burden of red tape and how it impacts businesses out there. It really reduces the amount of people that small businesses hire. It hamstrings businesses across the province. They could be spending time selling more products or exporting products to other countries. But this is a serious issue in Ontario, with nearly 400,000 regulations on the books. For this piece of legislation to reduce $6 million to $9 million in red-tape costs is a drop in the bucket.", "I would encourage the government to get serious about this and to, quite frankly, go further, to make Ontario the best place to do business, to create employment, to expand business, to sell products around the world, because we do have the best workers here in the province of Ontario. We need to unleash the full potential of our job creators and those workers in the province." ],

We definitely would have supported that change because it would have reduced and streamlined motor vehicle licensing in the province of Ontario. So there are some common areas.

You only have to look at last week’s report from the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario where she says that the Ontario government must tackle pollution affecting indigenous communities.

I can tell you that when we do this, and when we bring in bills like this, we will not raise hydro rates 300% and then try to give 25% of their own money back to the taxpayers and tell them, “This is all swimmingly good in the world. Just trust us: We’re really good at this.”", "We will not sell something like Hydro One, when 85% of the people of Ontario said, “Do not do this.

I don’t think anyone is arguing that there shouldn’t be a very strong regulatory regime for any type of pesticide. The issue is, does that suite of regulations work? It’s very questionable whether that suite actually works, whether all the things farmers are having to do—whether that actually has a purpose other than just filling out paper. That is the issue, and that’s something that this government has failed on time and time again, because instead of listening to the people who are actually working in their fields, be it mines, mills, forests, computer companies, wherever—these companies and these individuals all need regulation for their benefit as well, because good regulation sorts out the bad actors in every industry. The people in industry and, I know, the people in the farming sector depend on regulations to make sure that everything is on the up and up. But those regulations have to work.

  "text" : [ "Who doesn’t want to be debating red tape on a Monday afternoon—for only 20 minutes? I’m pleased to start my one-hour lead, and I suspect I get the pleasure and the privilege of finishing that tomorrow morning.", "It has been a really interesting debate, I think. As we are six months out from an election, there is this tendency to try to pigeonhole people in certain places, but there is a genuine and sincere difference of opinion on how we see regulations and the role that those regulations play.", "My colleague from Timiskaming–Cochrane correctly outlined how I genuinely feel about it. There is a time and a place for regulations: to keep people safe, to bear witness to those regulations which actually prevent people from getting hurt in the workplace—to basic health and safety, which we’ve seen serious violations of in the province of Ontario. Look how long it took for us to get the working-at-heights regulations passed. I’ve just given you a good example of the environmental regulations that have not been upheld in the province of Ontario. Environmental and health regulations—everything—there is a time and a place for regulation.", "Of this Bill 154, I have to tell you, we support the vast majority of the reductions in the regulatory burdens in this because many of them simply did not make sense. But schedule 4 is a non-starter. That is where the tension between the responsibility to business far surpasses—and, I would even say, trumps—the public interest. In schedule 4, in particular, we take issue with sections 2, 4, 7 and 8—and the last-minute amendment that was brought to the committee was just that: It was an afterthought. This poses a very serious concern for us.", "I think that the government has genuinely underestimated the concern on the part of the public with regard to how regulatory offsets will happen. Much of it is left, ironically, to cabinet and to regulation. There is such a lack of clarity in the legislation, in the law. And they point to the preamble, even. Just as a reminder, the preamble is a part of a law, but the substantive obligations are in the body of the legislation. This preamble does not contain enforceable rules.", "You have a government that says, “This is what we’re going to do,” and then it’s our job as the opposition members to say, “Well, this is what you’re not even doing right now.” How can we have any faith or trust, as you go forward with a vacuous piece of a section that says, “We’re going to make sure that the environment is protected and health and safety guidelines are upheld,” when we have so many examples that exist today where that promise is not being kept?", "I do think that the government bringing forward this incredibly large piece of legislation and embedding schedule 4 in it is a huge concern. As it plays itself out in the province of Ontario—and I sincerely hope that I’m wrong, actually, on this, because when the health and safety of the citizens whom we serve are compromised because of a government that’s looking to have the optics of responding to legislation and regulation, then we compromise the trust and the confidence of the people in the province.", "I did receive this one comment from a constituent who felt very strongly. It’s from Michael, and he says, “If ever there was evidence to prove that the Liberals’ so-called progressive veneer is nothing but, schedule 4 of Bill 154 should be it. Bill 154 is the cutting red tape bill, a suspect enterprise in itself, but schedule 4 is something that would make even Mike Harris blush.”", "In a nutshell, if passed, schedule 4 will make it mandatory that, going forward, whenever the government brings in a new regulation or reviews an already existing regulation, they will have to do a formal assessment of the costs that would be imposed on a private for-profit business, publish that assessment and then relieve the business of that cost and more by creating an offset, usually in the form of eliminating another regulation.", "At committee, when we had a number of environmental and legal experts come to the committee and specifically address schedule 4, I have to say that it’s astounding to hear the Minister of Economic Development and Growth dismiss those concerns out of hand and say that they are “off-base.” All of the people who came before us at the committee presented research and evidence, and—this may be of interest to some of the Liberal government members—pointed to examples under the Progressive Conservative Party and Mike Harris and Ernie Eves’s government which reduced the regulations in certain sectors. People suffered because of it. I know that they would like to put that behind them, but you can’t really put it behind you if you’re going to replicate the same mistake today. That’s an important lesson, I think, for all of us.", "So for those of you who are tuning in—my folks, primarily, watch this channel—Bill 154 is a follow-up to the Burden Reduction Act, itself a result of the Red Tape Challenge. It’s mostly the result of the findings of the Business Law Advisory Council—mostly. It’s an omnibus bill, which this government has become very fond of.", "If schedule 4 had been pulled and dealt with separately, I guarantee that it would have received more attention. While most of the omnibus bill is benign, there are serious concerns about schedule 4, the Reducing Regulatory Costs for Business Act, 2017. These concerns are shared not only by us—because I know that it’s easy to say, “Oh, New Democrats hate all regulation.” That’s completely untrue; there’s a time and a place.", "The organizations that came forward are numerous: the Canadian Environmental Law Association; Environmental Defence; CUPE presented a legal opinion, which I’m going to be referencing later—which we very much appreciate; tomorrow I’m going to be talking at length about the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario and their concerns with schedule 4 of Bill 154; the Ontario Federation of Labour; the Toronto Environmental Alliance; Earthroots; the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment; the Ontario Clean Air Alliance, Greenpeace; Northwatch; LEAF; Ecojustice; Ontario Nature; and last, but certainly not least, the Pembina Institute. So Bill 154 doesn’t just affect one or two stakeholder groups. This isn’t a special-interest pushback on Bill 154, and it doesn’t just affect workers, teachers or tradespeople. Bill 154 affects everyone who lives in the province of Ontario.", "Before I move on with talking about some of the concerns that we have around the offset versus the public interest, I do want to thank Emily Trudeau from my office—she did a great amount of the research that I’m going to be referencing—as well as Ana Qarri, who’s the OLIP intern in my office. That’s a great program, the OLIP internship program. I just want to say, with some humility, she’s my fifth intern in five years. That’s quite an accomplishment because they interview us, as you know, Mr. Speaker. They get to choose who they’re going to work with.", "I think as we look holistically at this piece of legislation, there was this moment after the 2014 election where the Premier talked about leading from the activist centre and being open and transparent, and trying to rebuild trust in government. Schedule 4 of Bill 154 compromises everything that the Premier said at that time.", "I’m going to read from a Toronto Star article from today, October 30: “Ontario Plan to Cut Red Tape Could Create New Risks, Critics Say.” This was an open letter to Premier Kathleen Wynne that says that a bill that “would reduce regulations for businesses could have a downside for public health and the environment.” This was done by Ainslie Cruickshank.", "It goes on to say: “Sixteen environmental and labour organizations, including several based in Toronto, are raising ‘profound concerns’ that proposed provincial legislation aiming to reduce red tape could have unforeseen consequences for human and environmental health in Ontario.", "“‘Although there’s some nice rhetoric in the preamble, in the substance of the bill it seems to be privileging economy over the environment,’ said Keith Brooks, the programs director of the Toronto-based organization Environmental Defence.”", "The Minister of Economic Development, who I do want to thank for his years of service—I haven’t had a chance to do that. But we fundamentally disagree on schedule 4, for sure. He says that those concerns are “off-base.” I think that the evidence that these environmental and legal groups came to us and demonstrated are valid points.", "He goes on to say that, “Bill 154, the Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act, has passed through committee and is now awaiting third reading”—we’re having this process right now. It obviously amends several acts and enacts a number of new ones aimed at reducing regulatory burdens.", "“In an open letter to Premier Kathleen Wynne, the environmental groups outlined their concerns with schedule four of the bill, which—if passed—will require ministries to assess and offset the administrative costs to business of any new regulations. For any $1 of new costs, ministries would have to establish an offset of $1.25.”", "This actually has been tried in other jurisdictions. The federal government under Stephen Harper tried this. Donald Trump—one of his first acts that he took on was to bring in a similar piece of legislation.", "“According to an amendment to the bill”—which we heard about earlier from the minister, who said it wasn’t even necessary—“made by committee last week, if any offsets to new regulations are established by removing a pre-existing regulation, officials would have to consider the protections of the public interest, including health, safety and the environment before removing a pre-existing regulation.” But we also heard that this was left to the LG and to cabinet to determine.", "“The change, though, doesn’t go far enough for Ramani Nadarajah, a lawyer with the Canadian Environmental Law Association.” This is what she says about the last-minute amendment to Bill 154: “‘I don’t think the amendment addresses our concerns.... If the government had wanted to ensure that Bill 154 did not result in the deregulation of public interest regulations, it should have granted an outright exemption for regulations dealing with public health and safety and the environment.’", "“While Brooks”—who I’ve already referenced—“said the amendment is a ‘step in the right direction’ and should protect against the removal of existing regulations that protect the public interest to make space for new regulations, he’s concerned it doesn’t address the larger concern that the clause will create a regulatory chill within government.”", "He goes on to explain what happens when addressing regulations becomes so onerous: “‘A requirement to find offsets is a deterrent to enacting new regulations,’ he said, adding ‘an independent inquiry found that this type of chill contributed to the Walkerton drinking water crisis.’”", "Just for those people who don’t know, because I think it is important to remember, “In May 2000 the drinking water in the small southwestern Ontario town became contaminated with E. coli killing seven people and leaving more than 2,300 ill.” Some of those people still, to this day, suffer from that contamination.", "“The public inquiry that followed found that a Progressive Conservative government policy, which required officials to conduct a cost-benefit analysis before implementing any new regulations, was partly to blame for why the government failed to implement a regulation requiring private water labs to quickly notify public authorities of adverse test results in municipal water supplies.”", "This also had to do with the privatization of public services, which the Progressive Conservative government has agreed is their preferred policy. They believe that private organizations and businesses can deliver public services. But what we didn’t know at that time is that the Liberal government, under the leadership of Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne, was going to double-down on the privatization of public services and even accelerate it in many regards.", "New Democrats think very strongly that this should serve as a cautionary tale. We should bear witness to the past and learn from the past and then not go forward in that same direction. I think that as legislators we actually have that responsibility to do that.", "It is interesting, though, how this bill has evolved and how the narrative around it has been created, because earlier, people were shaking their fingers at us and, in many respects, were sort of dismissing the environmental concerns that came forward through the committee. During committee hearings through last week, we heard time and time again from the government members that the preamble of schedule 4 clearly stated the intention of the bill. As I’ve just told you, the preamble is a part of the law but the substantive obligations are in the body of the legislation. I think that, while the preamble to this legislation says one thing, the bill opens the door to compromise and undermines that preamble and that intention.", "Before the bill went to committee, there was nothing at all in the actual bill that mentioned anything about protecting the health and safety of Ontarians, of workers, of the environment—nothing.", "In section 2 of schedule 4, which is where many of the concerns are based, it didn’t mention the public interest at all when it determined massive regulatory changes. Section 2 states, “Where a regulation governed by this act is made or approved and has the effect of creating or increasing one or more administrative costs, a prescribed offset must be made within a prescribed time after the regulation is made or approved.”", "So there are unanswered questions. This is as clear as mud, right? These unanswered questions are a serious concern for Ontario’s New Democrats because we like to see the details in the legislation. What is considered to be a suitable “prescribed offset”? Who sets that? What’s the definition of that? What is a suitable “prescribed time”? The minister says up to two years. What if they need three years? What if they need two weeks? What is the suitable prescribed period of time? Who has confidence in this government to determine that? What constitutes an “administrative cost”? Who gets to determine what those administrative costs are? Are these standards going to remain consistent across government ministries, or will they inadvertently create more red tape from one ministry to another ministry because this government has failed to address the siloing of initiatives across this government? We received no answers to any of these questions, and that’s what leaves us genuinely concerned.", "For example, if a new regulation is put in place to protect our drinking water, which already existing regulation is going to be removed in order to create that offset? What does that process look like? Is it just going to be people sitting around the cabinet table saying, “Well, I’ll give you this one if you take away that one”? We shouldn’t be bartering with regulations, especially when it deals with the health and safety of the people of this province whom we serve.", "So section 2 of schedule 4 raises serious concerns for us. The offsets are not designed to protect the public interest. There’s no guidelines or clarity around that. They prioritize cost savings over people, over health and safety, over the environment. This is the concern that we have. This is the concern that we brought to the government. This is the concern that many of the groups that came before us brought to the government.", "We tried to actually pull schedule 4 out of this legislation, and we would be supportive of it then. We would have been supportive of the PC motion to try to address, as I mentioned, the Motor Vehicle Dealers Act and try to streamline that. So we are not against reducing regulations that don’t make sense, but we are fully in support of regulations that protect the health, the safety and the environment in the province of Ontario. Schedule 4 definitely leaves the door open to further degradation of the oversight of the regulations that we already have in the province, as well as the creation of new regulations and offsetting through a process which is not clear to us.", "Mr. Speaker, I know I’m going to be continuing this debate tomorrow morning. Do I have to wait for you to stand up, or can I just get out of here? Is that possible?" ],

  "text" : [ "Mr. Speaker, I’m glad to join this debate. I think it’s a tremendously important issue to discuss, and I am honoured to be able to share my thoughts.", "First and foremost, I must commend the government on bringing forward this bill. It’s rare that opposition does that, but this is an important bill. It addresses a very important issue, and I do acknowledge the government’s work in introducing a bill that addresses such a serious issue.", "I’ll just lay out some of the groundwork on why this bill is so important and why this issue is such an important issue. Then I’ll move into some of the areas where we can improve it—there is always room for improvement. Let me just lay out some of the groundwork.", "According to a report by the John Howard Society entitled Reducing Barriers for Ontario’s Youth With Police Records, over 4.1 million Canadians—that’s roughly 20% of the adult male population—have a record of criminal conviction. In addition, in Ontario, our criminal court system processes more than half a million charges annually. And this is important: About 43% of criminal court cases resulted in stayed or withdrawn charges.", "So, it’s important to note that the issue of having contact with the criminal justice system sometimes results in convictions, but a large number of people are charged and eventually see those charges withdrawn or stayed. “Non-conviction records can be and often are disclosed on police record checks. These types of records can have as devastating an impact on young people’s employment, volunteering and academic prospects as records of convictions.” I end the quote from the John Howard Society.", "What we’re talking about are non-conviction records. If you are convicted of an offence, you’ve committed the offence, there is enough evidence that’s brought before the court, and after due process takes its course and you have the opportunity to defend yourself, you are then deemed to be guilty. There is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, upon which either a jury or a judge says, “Yes, there is enough evidence here that I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that this person is guilty,” and then there is a criminal conviction. In those cases—when there is a criminal conviction—the disclosure that someone has a conviction is appropriate. Disclosing that conviction under our criminal records is appropriate.", "The area that we’re very concerned about—that many civil liberties activists, many community organizers and many individuals have shared their personal stories about—is non-conviction records. What are those? These involve, according to, again, the John Howard Society—just a brief summary of what police records we’re talking about when we’re talking about non-conviction records: These can involve calls to 911 for assistance, victimization, mental health crises involving the police, being questioned by the police, arrests and charges that did not result in convictions. Now, it’s the last three issues that are of most concern currently, given the concerns that people have raised around carding and street checks.", "Let’s just quickly talk about carding and street checks. When we’re talking about carding and street checks, people are concerned about arbitrary or discriminatory stops that are conducted by the police that result in data being collected, people being stopped and people being discriminated against. When someone is stopped for a discriminatory reason, there is no evidence, there is no connection to what they are doing and a particular incident or some evidence or some complaint. There’s no reason, there’s no justification to stop an individual; it’s completely arbitrary. Those types of street checks, or that circumstance which is also known as carding in Toronto, result in some data being stored.", "When that data is stored—first of all, being subject to street checks that are arbitrary and being subject to carding that is arbitrary, in and of itself, is a harm; it makes you feel like you don’t belong. On top of that, that harm is compounded by the fact that there is data then stored. If that data is then released in a criminal records search, you’ve been doubly impacted. Not only were you improperly treated with the first arbitrary detention, but then the second negative blow to you is the fact that there is data that is being disclosed that has not been proven in court, that has not been tried; the evidence has not been tested.", "Whatever that data is, if it is in any way negative, it could impact your future career, whether it’s volunteering, whether it’s applying to a professional school or whether it’s trying to get a job—so, those types of interactions with the police, arrests when you’re eventually proven to be not guilty or when those charges are withdrawn.", "Mr. Speaker, if you have been arrested, if an individual has been arrested, and then they’re charged with an offence, and it turns out there was a mistake: They got the wrong person; the police admit, “Hey, listen, we just charged and arrested the wrong person. We withdraw the charges against you.” The fact of that charge and that arrest, that laying of a charge—that any disclosure of that could impact someone’s career is so completely ridiculous and offensive, in fact.", "We have a principle in Canada and in most nations where there is the rule of law, that you are entitled to the presumption of innocence. In fact, in Canada, this presumption of innocence is protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms says very clearly that you are entitled to it—this is one of your rights—that you should be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Now, that presumption, which is one of the hallmarks of any society that is based on the rule of law, is so fundamentally eroded when people who are not even convicted of an offence, who are absolutely innocent—they don’t even need the presumption of innocence because they are innocent. When those individuals who have been found not in any way to be guilty, in fact, have not even been charged—that charge is withdrawn—if those individuals are facing barriers and obstacles to employment and to volunteer opportunities, to accessing school, that is so fundamentally flawed; that is such an abrogation of that fundamental principle. So I think it’s something that we really need to address.", "There are a number of stories I want to share of individuals who have faced some serious issues based on this disclosure. I think that it’s important to put a human side to this story. I’ll turn now to the great work of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. They released a report in 2012 which, in a lot of ways, was one of the main reasons why and was one of the motivating factors why this bill is now before this House. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association, in conjunction with other organizations like the John Howard association, raised the issue that they were seeing a number of people being unfairly treated, receiving or facing unfair burdens and obstacles to employment, volunteer and educational opportunities because of non-conviction records. They raised this issue.", "In 2012, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association released a report. To follow up with that report, the association released something called Presumption of Guilt: The Human Story. This Presumption of Guilt piece was essentially a compilation of stories across Canada regarding what people had faced, the stories of people who had faced burdens and obstacles because of their non-conviction record. I’m just going to quote from the preamble of this follow-up to the report.", "“In the time since the release of our first report over 100 Canadians who are struggling with the impact of a non-conviction record have contacted CCLA. We decided to record just a few of their stories.” So the following are going to be some excerpts of stories from people who were impacted by non-conviction record disclosure and who responded to the 2012 report by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. Again, I really want to recognize the tremendous work of CCLA in standing up for civil liberties, not just in this case but in a variety of other areas of great concern. The first story is Gord.", "“Gord was a nursing student when he was asked to get a vulnerable sector check in order to complete college placements. His non-conviction record, which was nearly two decades old when it was disclosed on his police check, completely altered the course of his life.” His quote is: “You sort of wonder how one group could have so much power to influence your life. Even if you haven’t been charged with anything, even if you are innocent, they can still affect you decades later, if they haven’t cleared your records. And that’s a problem....”", "So Gord was a nursing student and faced difficulties in his college placement for charges that, again, he wasn’t convicted of. He wasn’t even found guilty. These were charges that were withdrawn. The fact that withdrawn charges could impede someone’s career in something as important and noble as the nursing profession is absolutely unacceptable.", "There’s another story; this one is about Robin: “Robin was 18 and pregnant when her male roommates started dealing drugs out of the apartment. She tried to find a new place to live, but before she could move the police came and charged everyone who lived there with trafficking. The charges against her were withdrawn, but her record has followed her, preventing her from pursuing her career and furthering her education.”", "Again, this is another circumstance. How unfair is that? In the first place, for her to be charged—in some fairness to the police, perhaps, everyone who was in the facilities or the premises were charged, but eventually they realized that this didn’t even take going to court. Robin didn’t need to defend herself in court because the police looked at the evidence and, in fairness, they realized there wasn’t enough evidence to proceed and they withdrew the charges against Robin. Despite that, the fact that those charges were still on her record, that they were disclosed, that she was charged with some drug-related offence—that drug-related offence charge was withdrawn. She still received a barrier. She still was impeded and prevented from furthering her education and pursuing her career. Keep in mind that this is an 18-year-old woman; she’s pregnant at the time. The fact that we have someone in this circumstance who is already vulnerable and on top of that is faced with this severe obstacle is completely unacceptable. It just really shows you the human story of how non-conviction record disclosure can impact someone.", "I want to move on to another story just to add the human element to this issue. This story is about Lana. “Lana’s abusive ex-partner phoned the police and accused her of assault, twice. After leaving her partner she was unemployed and needed financial assistance to try to pay school application fees. When she first went to Ontario Works, they initially told her they wouldn’t even pay for the application for nursing school because there was a chance she wouldn’t get a nursing placement while in school.”", "Her quote: “I’m not guilty, I didn’t do anything, it’s just someone manipulating the system against me.... That life-long discrimination is just infuriating, for something I didn’t do.... It’s humiliating. Because I’ve never, ever, ever, ever, not even close to it, being in trouble—never been in trouble in my life. And now all of a sudden, it’s like, why aren’t you working? What did you do? There’s this whole presumption that I must have done something terribly wrong.”", "That’s the issue here: Though we have this principle of the presumption of innocence, when you are faced with—if you are an employer, if you’re someone who’s in school administration and you receive an application and on that police record check it says, “charged with possession of a narcotic,” “charged with trafficking in a controlled substance,” “charged with” some heinous assault—looking at that assault, whether it was withdrawn or stayed or acquitted, there is so much stigma that is associated with that. There’s such a negative presumption that flows from that, simply the fact that you were charged. That’s why it’s so important that that charge not be disclosed in the first place. It’s so important, Mr. Speaker, that we don’t disclose information that has not been proven in a court of justice, that has not been proven to be true. We can’t be disclosing this type of information. It’s already difficult enough for people to find a job or to find volunteer opportunities. We don’t want to discourage them and, in fact, impede them further, and that is why it’s so important that we have this piece of legislation.", "Let’s take a break from the stories—we’ll come back to some more life stories—and talk about the legislation and some of the good things it does and some of the things that we need to improve upon. What’s important to note is that the bill offers some guidance in an area that, up until now, has been quite unclear in terms of what the acting principles, the guiding principles, are around when you should disclose and what you should disclose when it comes to criminal records. So it’s important that we have this clarity. There has been a lack of clarity up until this point.", "Underneath this piece of legislation, there are a couple of really important components. One component is that, upon application for a police records check, the individual who is applying for the police records check has to provide their consent for the police check to be initiated in the first place. I think that’s absolutely important. We don’t want to allow circumstances where third parties can make a check, or can order a police records check, without the consent of the individual it involves. That’s very important, and that’s included in this bill. I think that’s an important issue.", "In addition, it’s also part of this bill, which is an important component, that if there is a police records check that’s initiated, the results of it first go to the individual who made the request. So it goes to the individual first and then they have to consent in order for it to be released any further. So that’s an important extra protection. I think that’s worth acknowledging. It’s very important to acknowledge that the bill basically breaks down three types of checks. This is under section 8. They break into three categories: there’s a criminal records check, there is a criminal records and judicial matters check and then a vulnerable sector check.", "The first check is probably the most common. It’s the straightforward criminal records check. The bill makes it very clear that the starting point will be that non-conviction records are not to be disclosed. That’s important, and that’s a good starting point. I acknowledge that, and I want to recognize that that’s something important. Actually, it’s also important to recognize that a host of stakeholders were consulted on this bill and did support it, and those ranged from individuals in the police services to individuals on the advocacy side, as well as people who are victims or people who are charged and who are in circumstances where they are impacted by disclosure of non-conviction issues, as well as the CCLA. So those stakeholders were consulted and supported it.", "There are, though, a couple of areas of concern. One of those areas is when it comes to the exceptions. Under section 10 of the Police Record Checks Reform Act, there is a headline which indicates “Exceptional disclosure of non-conviction information, vulnerable sector check.” Underneath that, under section 10, subsection 2, there are criteria for exceptional disclosure. This is where we have a couple of areas of concern. First off, I acknowledge that there are circumstances where, in exceptional circumstances, there are exceptional cases where there may be an importance, there may be a requirement to release some information that doesn’t actually make up a conviction. So in those cases, then, maybe you do have to release occurrences or charges that were withdrawn. There may be some grounds to do so. There may be some reason to do so.", "A couple of areas of concern: In the criteria that are listed, it’s not clear that the position that’s being applied for has to have a connection—that there needs to be a nexus between the position applied for and the entries in the record. What I mean by that is this: We have to keep in mind that this exceptional disclosure circumstance is the disclosure of things that are non-conviction. We’re talking about things that people are actually determined by a court of law to be innocent of. They’re actually offences where they may have been the wrong person and the charges were withdrawn. They might have challenged the issues in court and were found to be not guilty. These are incidents that could simply be occurrences where the evidence wasn’t tested by a court; there wasn’t the opportunity to test the evidence. These are already issues that aren’t convictions. And in that exceptional case where there is some reason to be releasing that information, there has got to be a connection between the position you’re applying for and the type of records that you have.", "What I mean by that is if there are some entries in your criminal record that are not convictions—you’ve not been found guilty—but they’re related to something that’s quite troublesome, perhaps something around offences related to children, which we’re all very concerned about and are very serious, but again, they’re not convictions; you have not been found guilty—if you’re applying for a position at an old age home or your work will be involved with elders, but the entries that are non-conviction are related to children, then there isn’t really a direct connection between those entries and what you’re applying for. It’s got to be something that is very connected.", "If your entries are for something that involved fraud or fraudulent behaviour with seniors, but you’re applying to work with youth, there isn’t a connection between fraudulent offences against seniors, which are, again, very serious—but you haven’t been convicted. If you want to disclose that information that is non-conviction, that you’ve not been proven guilty on, you should be entitled to the presumption of innocence. If you are being subject to having that information released, and it doesn’t connect to the actual employment or education that you’re pursuing, then, again—that criteria needs to be added; it’s not included here. That’s one issue that I raise.", "The second issue, which is even more important, is the criteria for exceptional disclosure. I just want to read from subsection 10(2): “Non-conviction information about the individual is not authorized for exceptional disclosure unless the information satisfies all of the following criteria....”", "Subsection 10(1) reads: “This section applies with respect to the disclosure of non-conviction information in response to a request for a vulnerable sector check in respect of an individual.”", "The criteria that are listed are good criteria, with the exception of the additional point that I raised; however, the mechanism to apply this criteria is not clear. As it stands, the decision-making and the discretion would lie in the hands of the police. While our police officers do phenomenal work in our communities to keep us safe, while front-line officers are essential in our public safety, if police are the body that control or house the data—they have the data; they have the records—and they’re also the body that you apply to for whether this should be released or not, and they also have the discretion about whether to release certain information or not, and they also apply the criteria, inherently, it’s a system that is not as transparent or as accountable. If the police themselves are the ones who are making the decision—they have to apply their criteria—then it’s not an open system. What I mean by that is if I’m applying and I submit for a records check, the police look at my circumstance and then look at the criteria. They then make the assessment, “Okay, the criteria apply.” There is no opportunity for me to say, “Hey, listen, I don’t think their criteria apply.” There is no way for me to actually dispute that, in terms of having my opinion, to come forward and say, “Listen, there isn’t a connection between what you’re hoping to release and what I’m doing. The criteria that you’re applying don’t apply to me.” There is no form for that.", "What there is is after the case, there is an opportunity for reconsideration; that’s what it states. You can request a reconsideration. Again, you’re not provided with the reasons for the decision, you’re not provided with the manner in which the criteria were applied, so there isn’t really that due process.", "What BC has proposed, because they recognize that this is a very valid concern—the government in British Columbia created a separate, independent body. That independent body is assigned the task of assessing the risks and applying the criteria, and it is independent from the police services. So there is a level of independence, there is an increased level of transparency and, because it’s an independent body making that decision, you have a greater opportunity for accountability and to challenge those decisions if they are inappropriate.", "Again, the entire purpose for bringing this forward is because there has been improper use of the existing discretion. The whole reason we’re bringing this bill forward is because there’s an acknowledgement that in the existing system, records were disclosed in a manner that was not proper and people were severely prejudiced because of it. If we know that that’s an issue, the solution has to also acknowledge that if we continue down the same path of allowing all the discretion to be in one group, and not an independent group, then the problem continues. That’s an area of concern, and much like the British Columbia decision, I’m suggesting that there needs to be some independence in that decision-making.", "The Canadian Civil Liberties Association, as I indicated, released a report in 2012. They also made a series of recommendations. In them, they made recommendations to the provincial, territorial and federal governments, as well as to police services and police service boards, businesses, not-for-profit organizations and third-party record check companies.", "Referring to their recommendations around provincial, territorial and federal governments, the CCLA stated, under their recommendation 1.2: “Governments should introduce legislation based on British Columbia’s Criminal Records Review Act, establishing centralized bodies to conduct vulnerable sector screening and evidence-based risk assessments. These bodies should provide screening services for all positions that would qualify for a vulnerable sector check.”", "Now, it’s important to note that they included the language “evidence-based risk assessments.” Broadly speaking, one of the other problems that was raised by both the John Howard Society and the CCLA was that there seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to criminal record checks. It can’t be the case that in every circumstance you need a criminal record check. There has to be some thorough analysis. It shouldn’t be the case that anyone can just request that you have to have a criminal record check for any job. That doesn’t seem to be a very logical proposition.", "What the CCLA and the John Howard Society are recommending is that there needs to be an evidence-based risk assessment. There needs to be a look at: “Is there evidence that suggests that in this particular type of work or this particular type of education, there is a risk that is posed where there is evidence of a certain type of criminal activity?” If there is some clear evidence and that evidence is related to the actual risk assessment, then in that case it makes sense and there should be an assessment. Then, that means we need to actually look at whether there needs to be a criminal records check or not. I think the issue here is that it shouldn’t be the case that—what it looks like now is that any job you apply for, there’s always an automatic criminal record check. That’s a problem.", "The other concern around criminal record checks, broadly speaking, was raised by a number of community groups, and one member of our caucus raised this issue as well. It’s that there is a cost associated with a criminal record check. That cost is something that often acts as a barrier, in and of itself, for individuals who want to volunteer. First of all, there’s a cost, and there’s a time issue. The cost is both financial and time-related.", "So you want to apply to volunteer in a position in your community—you want to help out, contribute and give back—but the requirement is for a criminal record check. Two issues come up. One is that it takes a long time. You have to follow through a lot of hurdles and a lot of bureaucracy to get your criminal record check completed. It takes a lot of waiting time, sometimes in lines, to get this done. The process is very difficult, and there is also a high cost.", "In terms of the actual act, it’s information that’s stored, presumably by the police, in a database, and the fact that the charges are sometimes so exorbitant, so high, doesn’t seem to make sense. It creates a barrier. So if I want to apply to help out in my local community but there is a criminal records check that is going to cost me a lot of money and take a lot of time to process, maybe I don’t bother to do it. The fact that some people are precluded from applying for positions like this because of this cost barrier is not acceptable.", "So we need to address why there is a cost in the first place. Can that cost be waived if you’re applying for a volunteer position? You’re giving your time freely. In those circumstances, perhaps the cost should be waived. If you are applying for a job and you are a youth or somebody who can’t afford to make ends meet, and you’re struggling and you want to find a job to pay some of your bills, you have to pay money to start earning money. It’s difficult in those circumstances. So there needs to be a look at whether—if it’s a young person applying for a criminal records check or someone who’s applying for a volunteer position, in those circumstances perhaps the charge could be waived.", "Also, we have to look at ways of streamlining this process so it can be quicker and people aren’t waiting a long time. The member from Welland raised an issue, that sometimes in the health sector there are opportunities that are missed because the wait time is so long. The opportunities are available, but the wait time to get your criminal records check takes so long that you miss an opportunity. That’s another issue that has been raised.", "So to sum up these last two points, we need to really evaluate whether or not, in terms of provincial leadership, there’s a reason to be requesting a criminal records check. In all circumstances, I don’t think it makes sense to just immediately need a criminal records check. There needs to be an evidence-based risk assessment: Do we need to look at the risk of this individual in this particular employment? Does it make sense for us to do so? If it does, okay, let’s move to the next step and then make that assessment.", "Secondly, the other area of concern, broadly speaking, is that we need to look at ways to make it easier to access your criminal record. Employment opportunities for young people, who are already facing some of the highest unemployment in the history of Canada, and Ontario is facing a high youth unemployment rate, well above our regular unemployment rate—we need to make sure that there aren’t additional barriers to youth, perhaps waiving the records for youth. And again, the volunteer component: If someone is applying to give their time freely, there needs to be a consideration for perhaps waiving that fee as well.", "I want to return again to some other stories around this issue of criminal records checks and why it’s so important to address this matter and the real-life stories of people who are impacted by it. I want to share the story of Chris. Again, this is from the CCLA’s follow-up to their 2012 report that compiled some stories they’d received of individuals who had faced barriers because of non-conviction records.", "“Chris had been accepted as a volunteer firefighter in his small town and was several months into training when he realized that his vulnerable sector check listed him as the subject of a drug investigation. Chris had never even been questioned by the police, much less charged with any offence. He assumes that his name was entered into police databases because he had a friend who was arrested and charged with drug offences—Chris had met the undercover officer who was investigating his friend, but Chris was never questioned by police or charged with anything.”", "I quote his story: “It’s a small town, I mean, all the people I was in class training with, it was a class of 25 or 30, they all know I got kicked off. All the people at the station know I got kicked off. I run into these people on a daily basis. I feel now like a criminal and I haven’t done anything wrong. Or even if I had done something wrong, I’ve never been to court to prove it. It’s like guilty until proven innocent....", "“It kind of ruined my chances. My whole plan was getting on, and getting full time—it threw that out the window. Now I’ll never be able to be a firefighter.”", "We have to understand that these are real lives that are impacted. These are people who are faced with losing a career over not having done anything. These are people who are actually innocent, who have not committed an offence. They were the subject of an investigation; in this case, an individual who may have been approached by a police officer but not even questioned. Their name just came up because they were in contact. I don’t blame the police in this case. They contacted this individual; that’s not their fault, but the fact is that that record was disclosed that he was the subject of a drug investigation when he wasn’t charged with an offence, let alone convicted. The fact that, just because he was—in some broad-speaking, vague way—involved in the investigation as someone that the police contacted, for that information to be disclosed, is absolutely unacceptable. The fact that that information precluded him from becoming a firefighter is even more unacceptable.", "I want to share the story of Lois: “Lois was trying to board a flight to Los Angeles to spend Thanksgiving with family when she was pulled over by American border officials for secondary screening. She was told she was not able to cross over to the United States because Toronto police had attended her home in 2006 after a 911 call for medical assistance.", "“This interview was conducted in February 2013,” some seven years later. “Since then the matter has been resolved. Lois is not at liberty to comment further due to a confidentiality agreement.", "“‘To me, this is the kind of thing that needs to have a public airing.... But many people are not willing to be public about it because they fear the embarrassment, they worry about job security.... I think this is something that we really need to look at, because too many people are being hurt—and too many people will continue to be hurt—if we allow this to go unchallenged.’”", "It’s important to know that this impacts not only employment, not only educational opportunities; it also impacts something like travel, people going to the States or going to other countries—international travel. When there is the sharing of information, and certain information is allowed to be shared that is not relevant to someone’s risk in any way—someone is not in any way convicted of an offence—it should not provide this barrier.", "I want to talk about, again, the impact of these from my own experience as a criminal defence lawyer. I represented a number of clients, many of them who were innocent, who were either wrongly accused, or misidentified at the scene. There was very clear evidence that could exonerate them. I personally represented these clients. Great kids: They had a great future and great potential. The fact that they were simply charged with an offence—they received good representation and were able to be found not guilty. But the fact that they were charged, that those charges were either withdrawn in some cases, or that those charges were eventually acquitted of them, and that they were now going to face barriers to their employment in the future, to me, is something that I can’t live with. The idea that people that have such great potential, that could be such great contributing members of our society, people that have so much hope and so many aspirations, people that I’ve dealt with—I represented them. I got to hear their stories. I got to meet their families. I know that they’re good people, and I know that they’ll go on to do great things. But I know also that, simply because they were charged, they are going to have greater barriers unless we pass laws that protect them. They’re going to have difficulties accessing certain educational opportunities. The fact that they’re going to perhaps be looked over or passed over for job opportunities is just not acceptable to me. It’s something that’s troubling and it’s something that needs to be resolved.", "There’s a larger discussion around barriers that exist and particularly when they exist for people who are already vulnerable. We have a vulnerable sector check, but we also have people that are more likely to be in contact with the police and more likely to get charged. Those individuals are often younger individuals, often racialized, often from lower socio-economic backgrounds, and living in neighbourhoods where there’s a higher police presence. It’s not because of their own fault, not because of anything they’ve done wrong, but it happens to be a community that, because of issues of poverty, there’s a heightened degree of policing, and they are now more likely to be subject to police contact. People who are already facing systemic barriers, whether it’s racism or whether it’s poverty issues—they’re facing systemic barriers. Those systemic barriers are then augmented or made worse by the fact that they have police contact which results in charges. These charges are maybe acquitted or withdrawn. But they’re still going to face barriers. That’s what’s so troubling to me: It creates a system that’s already unfair and makes it even more unfair for them.", "That’s why we’ve raised concerns around carding; it’s the exact same issue. When there’s police contact that can be disclosed and that can negatively impact, like these stories I’ve shared—people have lost the opportunity to travel, to get employment, to get education, due to information that is stored that doesn’t have anything to do with their guilt or innocence. That information being disclosed results in these issues.", "In the same way, carding not only allows for one additional avenue for information to be disclosed that might result in some other barriers to employment, volunteering and education, but carding itself—when the act of stopping someone is arbitrary, when the act of stopping someone is discriminatory and when the act of stopping someone in a street check or carding circumstance is not based on any evidence, is not based on any specific complaint and there is no connection between some evidence and that individual—when that’s not present, it’s unacceptable to stop these individuals. What it does, Mr. Speaker, is that it further sends a message that you don’t belong. It tells people living in their own community, people who live in their own neighbourhoods, that simply for existing, simply for being, simply because you were there, you are not welcome.", "People are stopped multiple times in their own neighbourhood for not having committed any offence, for not even being a subject of an investigation. The fact that that practice is going on, arbitrarily and in a discriminatory fashion—often that discrimination is based on youth and based on race—is so unacceptable. It’s something that is fundamentally offensive, and it violates our charter. It’s something that can’t be regulated. You can’t regulate a practice that is inherently violating our charter. It can’t be regulated, and the government is taking a course of action where they want to regulate this practice. It can’t be regulated, Mr. Speaker. If a practice openly violates our charter rights, it cannot be regulated. It is illegal.", "The concerns that are raised—there are public safety concerns; there are issues around police investigations. I wholeheartedly support the work of our front-line officers. They have tremendous tools, and they are very capable of using those tools to keep our communities safe. Those tools that exist allow the police to stop individuals, the tools that exist allow them to investigate individuals and, in fact, the tools that exist allow the police to search individuals without a warrant. But there is a requirement that there are reasonable grounds to do so, that there is evidence to do so, that they can articulate a cause, that they can give a reason. When there is a reason present, the police have the ability to do a whole host of things.", "The issue that community activists have, the issue that members of the civil liberties associations have, the issue that legal experts have, is that when you have an arbitrary system, an arbitrary detention, arbitrary stops—stops for no reason, no evidence—those are unacceptable. They cannot be regulated. When you have discriminatory stops—stops that are based on simply the colour of your skin, stops that are based on your age, stops that are based on young people hanging out at night—that’s not reasonable grounds.", "Reasonable grounds are very well articulated, very well laid out through years and years of jurisprudence. There is clear jurisprudence around what reasonable grounds are. We know this. If there are reasonable grounds, if an officer can articulate those grounds, then it’s absolutely fine to engage in whatever the tool may be, whether it’s an investigation, an investigative stop or whether it’s actually searching the individual. If there are grounds, then it’s appropriate.", "All we’re saying, very clearly, is that if there are no grounds, if there’s no reason to do so, they should not be stopped. That issue of carding, compiled with the issue of disclosing non-conviction records, is creating a heightened sense that the police are not serving the community. Again, this is not the fault of the police. This is the fault of the government. The government has a responsibility. The provincial government, in this case, has a responsibility to provide the leadership. They have an opportunity to do so. They have the means to do so. They have the authority to do so. They simply must take that next step and actually act.", "So, on this non-disclosure piece, the government has finally taken the right decision and acted—years of various activists raising this concern, years of various legal experts raising it, and various advocacy groups raising this concern, saying that people are being impacted by this.", "I think it is really important, as I forgot to note, and I want to get into this as well, the tremendous work of the Toronto Star with respect to this issue. In specific, I want to give a shout-out to the great investigative journalism of Mr. Robert Cribb. Mr. Cribb has released a series of reports around the impact of disclosure of non-conviction records, and I think it’s really important to note his tremendous work. He shared a number of stories. I’m just going to share one of those stories.", "In an article published June 22, 2014, again by Mr. Robert Cribb, the article reads: “‘No Judgment, No Discretion’: Police Records that Ruin ... Lives.”", "He outlines the story of Andrew and indicates that “Andrew’s career-limiting moment of humiliation unfolded in front of a distinguished colleague in the security line at Pearson International Airport.", "“The 42-year-old Toronto area businessman was on his way to a prestigious trade conference in the United States last year that promised valuable networking opportunities for his construction firm.", "“He’d prepared for months.", "“But it was all ... undermined thanks to a minor contact with a police officer 24 years earlier that torpedoed the biggest business trip of his career and continues to compromise his professional credibility and prospects.”", "Mr. Speaker, 24 years ago—I mean, what were you doing 24 years ago? A “minor contact with a police officer” 24 years ago. I mean, it’s funny, because we think of what we were doing 24 years ago, but it’s not funny for Andrew. The fact that a minor contact 24 years ago is impacting his career in such a significant way is just unacceptable. Like my colleague is saying, it’s abusive. It’s abuse. This is something that is absolutely unacceptable.", "Again, like the other stories we’ve shared, the individual—in this case, Andrew was “directed into secondary screening for the first time in his many trips south ... waiting 90 minutes in puzzlement until a US border guard asked him if he’d ever been convicted of possessing narcotics.”", "He said, “No, sir,” of course; he had not. He would have known that. That’s a pretty big offence, possessing narcotics.", "“The officer told Andrew that records showed he was investigated for possession of narcotics in 1990 and that, as a result, he was being denied entry to the US.”", "Keep in mind, he had never been convicted of a crime. This is simply an investigation from 24 years earlier, and that investigation precluded him from going to the States. He was never even charged. This wasn’t a case where he was charged and then the charges were withdrawn, which also is completely offensive, because he’s been found not to even need to go to court to defend himself, but he wasn’t even charged in this case. This is a serious issue.", "There are a number of other stories. Mr. Cribb went on to talk about something that I initially raised, that Toronto police have experienced a 92% increase in police background check requests in the past five years—a 92% increase over the past five years. So, as I was saying, we need to really evaluate why there is this sudden increase in police record check requests. It shouldn’t be the case that you immediately request a police record check for any employment. There has to be some reason for it; there’s got to be some basis for it. There has got to be some risk assessment. It shouldn’t be just a knee-jerk reaction where if you’re applying for a job, you need a record check. Given the fact that it has increased 92% in five years without any justification, there are some concerns here.", "Again, if there is a risk that is identified and there is a risk assessment that’s required based on some evidence, that’s absolutely appropriate, and that’s what we need to see. That’s why it’s so concerning that this trend is increasing towards increased criminal record checks without any reason for them, and people are being precluded from opportunities when they haven’t even been convicted of an offence.", "Mr. Cribb goes on to talk about the fact that people have had to seek legal representation at a great cost to have records deleted. Again, these records are not even convictions. These records aren’t in any way showing criminal guilt. These are records that are non-conviction in nature, but they have to obtain legal representation to get those removed so they can actually move on with their lives. Again, this is something of great concern, and I want to again acknowledge the great work that Robert Cribb did in raising some of these concerns.", "He also wrote another article on May 17, 2014. The article is entitled “Canadians Stunned to Learn They Have Police Records, Despite Never Being Found Guilty.” In this case, the story is about Chris. He’s a 27-year-old construction worker. He “hoped that firefighting was a calling he would one day turn into a profession.” He was asked to provide a vulnerable sector check.", "The results left him stunned. The check “indicated no charges or convictions.” There was a letter attached. It said he was named in a drug investigation. Again, just for being named in the drug investigation, it precluded him from an opportunity to go on to do his life’s goal, which was to become a firefighter.", "There’s significant stigma associated with it. It has gone on to plague him in his own community. Again, not being charged, not being found guilty has resulted in him not being able to pursue his career of choice, and perhaps us missing out on a great firefighter. There are so many stories. The impact that this has is tremendous.", "We looked at, to a large degree, career opportunities and educational opportunities. I want to focus on the impact of stigma. The impact of stigma can’t be understated. We already know that your sense of self-worth has a significant impact on your ability to be successful in society. One of the reasons why we have raised such a concern around carding and street checks is because that feeling of being stopped in your own community for no reason, just because you’re there, sends that feeling that you don’t belong.", "Similarly, when you are faced with the stigma of having committed an offence, of being treated as if you’re guilty of an offence which you’re not guilty of, it sends this very powerful message that you are unacceptable, that there’s something wrong about you. You live with this feeling. The stories talk about feeling like a criminal, feeling like they’ve done something wrong when they haven’t, and that feeling is so crushing. It limits your ability to succeed. It limits your motivation to be able to be a contributing member of your society. It has such a negative impact, and we can’t state enough how horrible and how detrimental it is.", "It’s that feeling of not being valuable, of not having any worth, of being a criminal when you’re not, that we need to get rid of. That’s the human story here. That feeling, that limitation that exists, is so powerful and so debilitating that it really needs to be addressed, and that’s why this type of law is so important.", "In my last eight minutes, I want to move towards some of my recommendations. While I acknowledge that this bill is an excellent step forward—it’s not even an incremental step; it’s a significant step forward. It’s addressing a lot of the concerns that have been raised, and it sets out a very clear guideline that non-conviction records should not be disclosed. That’s absolutely appropriate.", "It breaks down a number of areas of checks, and the one area I want to address in more detail is when there are exceptional cases, when we determine that in a very specific case, when there are vulnerable people at stake—youth, seniors, or whatever the group may be; that based on their health or age, there might be a greater level of vulnerability—there might be some reason for us to disclose additional information. But this is where we have to be even more vigilant. Basically we’re releasing information that otherwise this law says we cannot release.", "In those circumstances, I have to highlight how important it is to have an independent body. BC’s solution was to strike an independent body. There is a certain cost associated with that, but the benefit is having an independent body allows for a tribunal or independent decision-making to assess whether or not certain information should be released, and to engage in that risk assessment. That risk assessment is vital, because as it stands right now, the discretion is in the hands of the police, the same people—again, it’s not their fault, but if they’re not provided with the guidelines and the tools to do their job, then they’re going to be left with this position.", "The police hold the data, and now they’re going to have to apply criteria and assess whether or not, with their discretion, these criteria are met and whether or not they should release or not release information. That system inherently is not the most transparent and accountable. We need to look at a more accountable and transparent mechanism, whether it’s a tribunal or whether it’s another mechanism.", "I’ve consulted with a number of legal experts and community advocacy groups, and individuals that have represented communities and community groups that are impacted by these types of non-conviction disclosures. I am hoping to propose an alternative solution that would look at creating more independence, that would allow for a solution that would take away that discretionary element from the police so that there is a more accountable and transparent way to do it.", "One of my suggestions will be that an application can be made to the court, to a judge who is independent, a judge who has that decision-making capacity to weigh the evidence and look at the circumstances and say, “Listen, in this particular circumstance, there is a certain risk; there is a certain number of entries that are non-conviction-related; and there is a nexus, a connection, between the two.” In this case, the criteria have been met or have not been met, and they can make that decision.", "That process would be open. That process would allow for two sides to be heard. The individual that is requesting the check, that wants to have a criminal record check, could actually raise an argument and say, “Listen, there is no connection between this offence, or this non-conviction record, and the opportunity that I’m seeking, and I don’t think it’s necessary to release it.”", "There is an avenue to provide more accountability. That decision also would be subject to appeal, to be reviewed, and that again allows for greater accountability. That’s the real issue here with respect to many of the concerns that we have. When the public feels concerned about police services, it’s not the police services themselves; it’s the lack of accountability and transparency around some of the decision-making. This would be a great step forward in terms of ensuring there is that transparency and accountability.", "Taking the decision-making and that discretionary power away from the body that controls the data and putting that in the hands of an independent decision-maker, like a judge, would allow for greater transparency. I think that’s a solution that I encourage the government to look at, in terms of addressing this concern—or look at the BC example and look at their criminal records act and how they’ve set up that tribunal. Both of those circumstances would provide a solution that would provide greater accountability and transparency and would ensure that our solution to a very serious problem doesn’t create another problem with respect to this discretion now being at question. So I ask you to consider that.", "I also want to highlight that this concern around the independence is something that has also been brought up by the CCLA. In their recommendation, they also request that the government look at the BC act, so I think it’s something that is strengthened by their recommendation.", "The John Howard Society took a very interesting angle on police records, and they focused in on the youth. I want to take a little bit of time here to focus in on the youth. We know that youth already are facing some of the highest unemployment rates in the history of Canada at this time. Given that there are already so many barriers for youth to finding employment, the existence of a record or record checks could create an additional barrier. They focused their report Reducing Barriers for Ontario’s Youth with Police Records on those barriers that are faced by the youth and really looked at some solutions to that.", "Their recommendations included—one of their recommendations, under section 2, was regulating the demand for police record checks.", "I’ll just read from 2.1: “The provincial government should commit to making Ontario a province that fosters barrier-free reintegration and inclusivity. It should model the efforts” under way in other jurisdictions on “eliminating the government’s use of stigmatizing and labelling language, and enacting policies akin to the ‘Ban the Box’ reforms in the US.” They go on to talk about the importance of limiting the ability or limiting the requests for criminal record checks in circumstances where it’s just not necessary and of ensuring that youth don’t have an additional barrier to actually accessing employment. They also talk about the regulation of the disclosure of the police records. That’s something that this bill, I think, will do. So that’s important.", "Finally, they talk about regulating the use of police records in general. This is something that has been called for by the CCLA as well, and the John Howard Society. It’s something around the Human Rights Code. I just want to read it out. I think it’s important. It’s recommendation 4.1, and it says, “The provincial government should amend the Ontario Human Rights Code’s ‘record of offences’ provision to broaden its definition to explicitly protect Ontarians against discrimination on the basis of any record of offences—which should include all non-conviction police records, mental health police contacts, criminal convictions and records that have been sealed subsequent to a record suspension—with a narrow exception allowed for employers who can demonstrate that a particular criminal record is reasonably and objectively connected to a bona fide requirement of the specific employment or volunteer position being sought.”", "So this is a step broader. If an individual has a conviction, and it’s for an offence that has no—even if they had a conviction. This is another area for us to look at. If that offence has no bona fide, evidentiary connection to a particular risk, a specific risk, whatever the employment or volunteer opportunity—if there is no nexus, and I do have a conviction—then that shouldn’t create a barrier for me either. There has to be reason for it to create a barrier. It shouldn’t just be that the existence of a criminal record means that forever you are precluded from opportunities. There needs to be some evidentiary basis for that; there needs to be some reason behind it. That would create a more inclusive society. Just because someone has committed an offence years and years ago and they haven’t received a pardon shouldn’t mean that their entire future or their ability to contribute to society is forever impeded." ],

I think those are two important factors that he was raising.", "I do have a question for him that I hope he could address in his rebuttal. This isn’t a “gotcha” question; it’s more of trying to get an understanding of when you were talking about the independent body that’s occurring in BC and some suggestions of what we could do here in Ontario.", "We also heard earlier, when you talked about cost and time—when we’re talking about time or employment or if it’s time for a volunteer organization to get this volunteer, would that process—have you heard in your research—then slow down if we are using that independent body? I think that’s important for us to get an understanding of. Especially when we’re looking at how this bill is going to change—making things more accountable. It’s going to really change some of the unnecessary barriers that citizens have been facing when it comes to non-conviction and non-criminal information, especially mental health records and those types of things being undisclosed in record checks. I’d appreciate to hear some information from the honourable member on that piece.", "Also, I think it’s important to reassure the honourable member, when he talked about this legislation and he was talking about street checks, that street checks will not be released under this legislation.

It reminds me why Justice was always presented as standing with the balance, because there are always arguments on both sides. I think in this case it becomes clear we must appreciate the long history and the long reach of—it’s not the law, in the sense of someone having been through the process; it is, in fact, being touched by the process. I think all of us would agree with the fact that the balance is tipped when you are standing in a line to get on an airline and something 24 years before prevents you from doing that.", "It’s all the more important to understand this and respond to it in an appropriate manner when you consider the kind of communications tools that people have. When you drive your car up to the kiosk at Fort Erie, the Peace Bridge or wherever, you know that your licence plate has been checked in the computer as you are driving there, and the identification you provide is verified. How much other information is there that is really extraneous? I know of a municipality that requires a police check, and it has nothing to do with vulnerable adults or vulnerable people.

He did quote, at length, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the John Howard Society. The John Howard Society, particularly on the issue of youth, has said that the release of non-conviction records is a “total repudiation of the presumption of innocence, a gross distortion of the right to privacy.”", "I think it’s important, and I think he touched on this, to remember that until you lose those rights of privacy, until your rights are violated, you actually don’t know how sacrosanct they are. And yet, the stories that he shared—I think it is very important to reflect on those human stories that are the truth, right? These are the lived realities of the people in the province. Inherent in the entire one-hour lead was the reality that there is a power imbalance in society, and we have a responsibility in this House to bring those voices, those marginalized voices, to this place.", "The relationship between police forces and the community—in some communities, Mr. Speaker, it needs to be acknowledged that it is very tenuous. When a police officer, in the instance of street checks, as he referenced, asks for personal information—unprompted, a random ask of that information—this happened to the member from Welland, and she challenged that police officer, but she is in the position of privilege. She felt empowered to challenge that ask. When you look at youth across the province, in some communities they feel more vulnerable, and they definitely don’t feel that they are speaking from a position of strength.", "So I share the congratulations that the member has given the government.

The piece of legislation before the House will prohibit the release of non-criminal information, such as mental health records, and strictly limit the release of non-conviction information. I think we’re all in agreement that that general prohibition is a good thing.", "The other thing the act also does identify, though, is that there are circumstances in which there need to be vulnerable sector checks. As Minister of Education, with responsibility for schools and licensed child care, those are two of the circumstances in which, in fact, we require that employees in schools and people who work in licensed childcare centres do, in fact, require criminal record checks and in particular the vulnerable sector checks, because they are dealing with children and have responsibility for children and, by the nature of their work, have a special relationship with children and often will have that relationship in a one-on-one encounter circumstance. In that case, we do require an easy test for figuring out if you can ask for a vulnerable sector record check.", "So I would just caution the member that in looking at tribunals and things like that—for example, one thing that we already run into problems with is that all the students who come into faculties of education all over the province each fall need to get a vulnerable sector check before they can go and do their practice teaching in the schools because, again, they’re going to have that special relationship. We need to be careful that we don’t back up the ability of those people to get their check done quickly in another context of looking at tribunals. We have to find the right balance here." ],

I think that, absolutely, having a tribunal process or having a process that requires an application to the court would increase time and cost. It would increase time and cost in circumstances where the result of the criminal record disclosure would preclude you from the job and the opportunity anyway. So it’s only in those rare circumstances where the release of information would actually generate a record that could actually preclude you from an educational opportunity or a job opportunity. That impact to your life would be a much bigger cost and a much bigger time loss. In those circumstances, it’s worth it.", "In cases where there isn’t a need for an application, it would be where you don’t have a response generated. You receive that response, there is no issue and you go on with your life. It’s only when there is a response generated that you perhaps make that application to a court or tribunal.

Historically, Sukkot commemorates the 40 years which the children of Israel spent wandering the desert, living in temporary shelters, or booths, after fleeing slavery in Egypt over 3,000 years ago. Agriculturally, it is a major harvest festival with an abundance of fresh fruit, vegetables and nuts.", "Over the seven-day holiday, the Jewish people are expected to eat all their meals in a sukka. When I was a child, everybody’s sukka looked pretty much the same: plywood walls with leafy branches for the ceiling. It was the children’s job to do artwork to decorate the sukkas, which are placed in backyards all across the province and country, and around synagogues as well.", "Sukkot is not just about gathering food from the harvest; it’s a week-long celebration spent gathering with friends and relatives. Last night, my family and I had dinner in Rabbi Janowski’s large sukka in Thornhill.", "I just want to finish with a quick joke. Imagine the first Jewish President of the United States calls to invite his mother for Sukkot, but she tells him, “I don’t like to travel.” “Come on, Ma, it’s going to be great. I’m going to send Air Force One to pick you up.” “I’d really rather not.” “Ma, there will be a limo to meet you at the airport.” “It’s really much too tiring.” “Ma, we’ll have lots of big-shot politicians and famous celebrities for parties at the White House sukka.” “All right, I’ll go.” When she returns, her neighbour asks where she went for Sukkot. “To one of my son’s.” “The doctor?” the neighbour asks. “Nah, the other one.”" ],

These are schools that are foundational in our communities. You cannot simply warehouse students in rural Ontario and expect to get the same results. These are small community schools; they are the lifeblood of these communities.", "I’ll tell you that the two of them that are most precious to our community are Harrow high—they’ve been fighting for their high school for years and years—and Western Secondary, which is the only vocational school anywhere from Windsor to Sarnia that you’ll find. They have an amazing program there: industrial kitchen, shop, metalworking. This is where you’re going to train those workers of tomorrow, but you’re going to cut that school.", "Here’s a warning: You’re going to have parents and community members chain themselves to the door to protect those schools." ],

It wants to stop paying post-employment benefits—health, medical, dental and life insurance—a slap in the face to the retirees who have suffered tremendous health difficulties because of their work. These benefits are depended on by retirees like people who have spent 30 to 40 years in the industry, in many cases, giving their all to a company in a town that had always been proud of its role in the steel industry.

But without a high school diploma, her options are limited, and she no longer believes that she will ever make it to post-secondary education.", "Imagine what six more months or one more year of support could have done for Jennifer and her two kids, and then consider how many people confront the same impossible reality each year.", "My bill would amend the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, so that housing transition programs can truly support women like Jennifer and all those whose circumstances in life have put them on the brink. As I noted in the introduction of the bill, the current subclause 5(k)(ii) provides that the act does not apply to certain living accommodations occupied for the purpose of receiving rehabilitative or therapeutic services if the accommodation is intended to be provided for no more than a one-year period. This bill amends this time period by extending it to three years for people living in temporary transitional housing.", "Transitional housing is an intermediate step between emergency crisis shelter and permanent housing. It is meant to provide a safe, supportive environment where residents can overcome trauma, begin to address the issues that led to their homelessness or kept them homeless, and begin to rebuild their support network and their lives. These programs are offered by organizations such as Covenant House Toronto, Samaritan House in Barrie, SouthWesthealthline, Transitional House and transitional housing at Serenity House in Ottawa, just to name a few. They tell us that, sadly, Jennifer’s experience is not unique. There are lots of people who aren’t ready to leave transitional housing programs after just one year.", "Our friends at Covenant House in Toronto and Samaritan House, which is in my riding of Barrie, are particularly interested in seeing this legislation passed. Covenant House deals primarily with youth homelessness. They operate a 28-bed transitional housing program on-site that they call Rights of Passage. Typically, about 60% of the youth graduate from this program, and average stays run roughly 200 days per youth. They are currently seeing a trend of younger youth in the program as well as more youth with mental health issues. Over the years, they have had many cases where a youth would have benefited enormously from staying in the program beyond the one year allowed through the Residential Tenancies Act. This could be for several reasons, including some of the following:", "—the youth are not ready because they’ve not learned the skills they need to move to independent living;", "—housing affordability or wait-lists mean that there is no other housing available at the time their one-year term under the Residential Tenancies Act ends;", "—the youth may suffer from attachment disorders, addiction, mental health, trauma or other issues that require more time before a sustainable, independent life is even possible;", "—they might be in school and cannot afford to move to independent living; or", "—there are times when they are ready to move out but have a sudden emergency that makes independent living impossible or unsustainable, such as sudden unemployment or a relapse into the issues that brought them there in the first place.", "If we continue to allow people to leave these programs with no hope, it means we are failing them and we are failing ourselves. Over and over again, when people are forced out before they are ready, they fall back into poverty or addiction, or return to an abusive spouse. As policy-makers, we need to say that this is not right. We understand that people learn at different paces and that people understand in different ways. People heal in different ways and at different rates. We cannot say that one year is enough for everyone.", "Samaritan House transitional housing provides safe housing for women and children recovering from domestic abuse or violence. It provides programming that helps women break the cycle of violence, as well as life skills, education and job search training. The staff at these programs are incredible, and they provide as much education and empowerment as they can, over the length of the program. But as with Jennifer, it often takes a good three months for these survivors to feel safe and secure. So it takes quite a while before they can give 100% to the programs. Even then, they often have self-esteem issues: fear of simple things like making a phone call to take care of an issue, or going for job interviews. As well, the end portion of someone’s stay at Samaritan House, although still working on the programs, is also heavily focused on assisting them to become stable once they leave.", "In my riding of Barrie, there is a housing shortage. Believe it or not, Vancouver, Toronto and then Barrie have the highest rental costs in Canada. We need to understand what this means for vulnerable people in transition. It means that they can work as hard as possible at the program and make incredible progress, but if they don’t have enough time to secure their finances before heading off on their own, we’re dooming them. The difficulty of finding permanent, affordable housing once they leave is a huge issue. The worst part is that it is the lack of stability that makes the children victims of these situations too, endangering their chances for a stable future.", "That is what makes transitional housing so great. It provides time with reduced rents and supports so that the people in the programs who haven’t completed high school can get their last credits and get their high school diploma. After the initial settling in to living in transitional housing and the beginning of working through the offered programs, it takes time to convince them that this is something that can be accomplished while living in this housing program. Their self-esteem is lacking; they have no confidence in their abilities. By the time they decide to do this, apply to do it and then work through the courses, the year is over.", "From a financial perspective, this bill would save a lot of money as well. The average monthly cost to help someone who is homeless starts with a shelter bed. It costs $1,932 per month for someone to stay in a shelter bed. It costs $4,333 per month for someone to stay in a provincial jail, and it costs $10,900 per month for someone in a hospital bed, versus $199.92 per month for social housing or $701 per month for rent supplements.", "It makes social and economic sense to pass this bill. It’s good for everyone.", "I want to conclude with the story of someone who did get to extend his stay in transitional housing. Let’s call him Mike. At 22, Mike was at Covenant House and managed to find work in building maintenance, but it was precarious. He could not support himself after his year in the community apartment program was up, but thankfully his stay was extended. In the second year, Mike entered a trades training program and continued to work. In the second year, Mike found his path to a brighter future.", "All in all, this bill would help people in my riding as well as many ridings across the province. The amazing organizations that run these programs would be able to provide individualized support to those people who need a little more time to become high school graduates, post-secondary students, employees and full members of our society. That is the right thing to do. It’s the smart thing to do.", "I urge you to support this bill, and I look forward to hearing from everyone who is going to speak about it." ],

We understand the importance of this housing to help people who are transitioning from homelessness, addiction and other challenges. The Canadian Mental Health Association states, “Research indicates that a stable and supported living environment is essential to maintaining the health and well-being of people with serious mental illness and is integral to their recovery.”", "I understand that the member’s goal is to ensure that people who need these housing programs for more than a year aren’t pushed out, but we need to remember that the Residential Tenancies Act is there to protect tenants. We need to be cautious that expanded exemptions might reduce the protection to the very vulnerable people we’re trying to protect. The programs that the member is talking about are not the ones that are regulated by that time frame in the tenancies act. It means that the tenancies act does not apply to those establishments. Putting them in those establishments, all kinds of other restrictions fall upon them. What we’re really looking for, in my opinion, and what the member is putting forward, is to provide an extension of the actual services provided in these places rather than whether it is or is not covered by the tenancies act.", "If it is happening that some of them are getting pushed out, I think we all need to do more to make sure that that doesn’t happen, that they have to get pushed out before they’re ready. Halton has put together a report on best practices for transitional housing called More Than a Roof. This report was funded through a grant from the federal government, and it found that “transitional housing programs are more effective if there are available options in the community for permanent (affordable) housing, as well as ongoing supports through community services.”", "Quite frankly, this government is failing on affordable housing. The Halton report did a great job of outlining the spectrum of housing from homelessness to transitional housing to affordable housing, all the way to homeownership. This bill addresses one small aspect of transitional housing. Again, I want to commend the member for her efforts, but I hope that the government will take this and build on it to address the many housing problems we have in Ontario. Over a year ago, the government declared their goal to end homelessness, but since then, we have seen very little progress made. In fact, our housing problems are getting worse.", "Last year, the Canadian Network of Women’s Shelters and Transition Houses released a survey of shelters across Canada. They found that one of the things that would make things better was, “Access to safe, affordable and permanent housing options. We find that this is one of the main reasons that women end up going back to the abusive relationships time and time again.”", "Every year, our affordable housing wait-list seems to reach a new record high. There are currently 168,000 families waiting for affordable housing in Ontario, and the wait-lists are measured in years. If this continues, we will soon be measuring them in decades, Mr. Speaker.", "On the far end of the spectrum, the cost of buying a house or a condo in Ontario continues to increase. This government continues to implement more policies such as allowing higher development charges and increasing hydro rates, which force up the cost of housing. Pricing is out of reach for more and more Ontarians, resulting in more and more people needing affordable housing. Across the entire spectrum, we need to do better, and there are things that we can do. We can look at models like Housing First, the successful model used in Medicine Hat; we can look at the city of Vancouver’s plans to encourage the building of more rental housing; and we can allow housing service providers to spend their money more effectively by no longer forcing them to purchase natural gas and insurance through the Housing Services Corp.", "This organization was created to save social housing providers money by negotiating bulk purchasing discounts. They were supposed to pass those savings on to the housing providers, but that isn’t happening. Toronto Community Housing has boarded up a number of their units because they simply can’t afford to fix them, but the TCHC’s own numbers show that if they had been allowed to purchase natural gas with the city of Toronto instead of the HSC, they would have saved $6.3 million in one year. Think of how much housing that could have provided, Mr. Speaker. Think of the difference that that $6.3 million could have made to the families waiting for affordable housing.", "And it’s not just Toronto. A report from Hamilton shows that they would have saved over $1 million if they hadn’t been forced by the provincial government to purchase gas through the HSC. Just this summer, a city of Stratford report found that they would have saved $41,000 by not purchasing gas through the HSC.", "As I mentioned earlier, the challenge that transitional housing providers face is that there aren’t enough affordable housing options available. The system isn’t working. The money going to the HSC is just part of the problem, but one that this government can easily fix and it will have a real impact.", "One of the things that is disturbing is where the money is going. While 168,000 families are waiting for affordable housing, executives at the Housing Services Corp. are jetting off to Europe, California and Australia. There are even unexplained expenses from Palm Beach and Rome. While these families are struggling to put food on the table, executives at the HSC are expensing alcohol, dinners at Canoe and fancy restaurants, and $8 water. While these families are on a waiting list that lasts for years, executives at the HSC are putting money into questionable business ventures, including over $1 million to a solar panel company and a company in Manchester, England, that never even existed except on paper. The people of Ontario deserve better.", "Again, I want to commend the member from Barrie for her interest in helping people who need transitional housing. Let’s take one more step and really solve the problem of affordable housing in Ontario.", "Thank you very much for your efforts. We look forward to working with you to solve the problem." ],

I believe in the road to Damascus and conversion moments, so let’s acknowledge this is one of them.", "I want to commend the member from Barrie. Absolutely, we, as New Democrats, will support this motion. Of course, what would we like to see? We would like to see this motion not be necessary because we would like to see affordable housing in the province of Ontario. We would like to see those—my figure is a little bit different from the member from Oxford’s—170,000-plus families in Ontario waiting for affordable housing to be able to get affordable housing. We would like to see youth, in particular, those who are served by places like Covenant House—let’s give a shout-out to them. They do phenomenal work and I’ve been cognizant of them, both as a clergyperson and also as an MPP, for decades now. They do amazing work.", "Of course, she’s right, absolutely right: We should not be turfing children and women out on the streets from the only housing they know. That’s the reality. Would that housing be permanent? Yes, it should be permanent, absolutely. I hearken to, hey, a bill that this House passed: inclusionary zoning. I know that the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore tabled a bill on inclusionary zoning, as have I for many, many years now. We need a system whereby municipalities can dictate that developers of over, say, 50 units actually set aside some of those units for affordable housing. Then we wouldn’t have this crisis that pre-empts this bill.", "So, yes, we need affordable housing. We need new builds. We need inclusionary zoning. And, by the way, we need real rent control. Let me tell you that in South Parkdale, where a one-bedroom goes for over $1,500 a month, vacancy de-control is not working. Property managers and the owners of the buildings can muscle out people, especially people without the knowledge to fight them at the tribunal—muscle them out of their apartments and then double the rent. That’s not okay. That’s not rent control. We need real rent control.", "We in the New Democratic Party have put forward that policy for years, many, many times—decades now. Yet somehow this Liberal government sees fit to side with the owners and the developers and not with the people who rent and who need housing—sad.", "Getting back to the member’s bill: I just want to tell a story, because I was one of those kids. I actually left home at 15, a long, long time ago. It was not a safe home that I came from. For many of our homeless youth, that’s the reality. For many of our homeless youth, the streets are safer than home. I’m going to repeat that: The streets are safer than home. We don’t understand homelessness, especially homeless youth, unless we understand that salient detail: that the streets are safer than home.", "As you walk out from this place, along College Street, Dundas Street and Queen Street, you will see homeless youth, and you will know that they’re not there on a whim. They’re not there because this is cool. They’re not there because they’re stoners. They are there because the streets are safer than home.", "When you grow up in a violent home, when you grow up in a home that is unsafe, and you leave home at 15, 16,17 or 18—back in my day, we had no place to go. We had our friends’ couches. We couch-surfed or—I often tell this story, because I think it’s a story of hope: Before I was elected here, I slept in Queen’s Park. I slept just north of this building for many, many nights in the summer, because it was warm and it was free.", "I know what it is to be a homeless youth, I know what it is to leave home and I know how desperate that story can be and how desperate that life can be. Think about it. If any parents here who are listening or who are in the crowd—I know myself, because I have two 30-something children. I think of them. When I was 15 or 16, literally with nothing—you can’t work. What are you going to do, Mr. Speaker? You can’t work. You can’t go home. Where do you go? What do you do?", "In my day, there was only the Fred Victor Mission, the one mission. I want to give a shout-out to them, because they have been around in the downtown centre of Toronto for decades, and they have provided such support. But even for children back then, that was no place to stay. You couldn’t stay there. That was older men. As a young woman, homeless—a kid—you didn’t stay there. You couch-surfed and you slept in the park. That’s what we did.", "Now we have options. We have options like Covenant House, and those options need to be able to do their job. They need to be able to care for these children where the home life doesn’t. Again, when the streets are safer than home, where do these children go?", "So yes, absolutely, I support this member’s bill. We need so much more, though, of course. We need inclusionary zoning. We need new bills. We need money into housing, both federal and provincial, and I have to say, we need a national housing strategy. We need all of the above and we need the member’s bill, because we at least need those providers who have been providing for decades without a whole lot of support to be able to do their job, to be able to look after the children whom we as a community haven’t looked after very well in the past. We haven’t done it.", "For the child that was me way back then, and for the children now, just a note: As you walk past those children and see them and think, “Oh, they are there because of drugs. They are there because of addiction. They are there because of mental health issues”—maybe, but they are also there because the streets are safer than home." ],

For years, this dedicated and inspiring group has worked tirelessly to offer youth and adult services to individuals struggling with substance abuse. They offer treatment plans, counselling and referral assessment, as well as community support and education. They do an incredible job building up our community and making sure that our neighbours don’t fall through the cracks.", "But sometimes the people who rely on ADAPT’s support need more time before they can get back on their feet. A one-year restriction on the length of time an individual can stay in this transitional support program is too limiting for the most vulnerable residents. A three-year limit will be a responsible and pragmatic approach, allowing incredible organizations like ADAPT to better serve and help their clients.", "This support will help Ontario families, our economy and our province. An extended limit would help cut costs, improve efficiency and help more people turn their lives around, and that really is what it’s all about.", "It’s tragic that anyone in Halton—or our province, for that matter—should have to go through life struggling with substance abuse.

And whether or not they qualify for it, there is just a lack of housing. Unfortunately, with this bill, it just means that there will be more people waiting. We have a drastic shortage of affordable housing, and we see that everywhere. I see people in my community of Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry who continually qualify for services but can’t get them. They’re on a waiting list.", "Just a couple weeks ago, a lady from the village of Williamstown, where I live, told me that she finally got some respite help for her developmentally delayed daughter, after years of applying to all these wonderful programs advertised by this government. Go to the website and there’s no shortage of programs. It’s a very familiar process. They’re told to apply. If they’re lucky, they get on a wait-list, and they stay there until either their children get too old to qualify or the program changes and they have to reapply. It’s a continuous story that we hear and a sad story, because these people need help in looking after their children, in many cases, or family members, and they are at their wits’ end.

It was from a not-for-profit we are sending them to, to get some help, because the fact is, they just don’t get any help from the government programs. It was the first time she had received any help, and it’s truly a sad state of affairs, but it is typical of health care in this province.", "We have a Premier who sits here and complains about the federal government not doing their fair share, but we don’t have to look much further than this year’s budget, with the old scheme of promising one thing, doing something else and then blaming somebody else. They’re so desperate for money that they actually cut $54 million from the federal government’s increase in health care spending to cover non-health care projects like their cancelled gas plants.", "The Auditor General warned us just last year that this wasteful spending would start to crowd out services, and we’re seeing it in a bill like this today, which really doesn’t do anything other than put more people on a waiting list.

My hope is that your party and your caucus support it wholeheartedly and do everything that they can to move this thing along, because it is quite straightforward. We are supporting people here who need that support. We are giving them an extension on what, essentially, is a lifeline to getting themselves back on their feet, establishing their roots in their communities, and transitioning through hard times, which we know everyone is susceptible to. You can never pinpoint when you might be affected—the loss of a job, unexpected illness, tragedies in your immediate family. This is stuff that gets triggered without any warning, and these supports have to be there. They have to be not only timely, but they have to recognize that sometimes it takes more time, and this is what you are doing here with this bill.", "Certainly many stakeholders in Ontario are supportive of it and, I think, have worked closely with you to develop the content of this bill.

The ability for transitional housing to be allowed for people to utilize for a period of up to three years, as opposed to just one, for many people in these precarious situations will be immensely important. Transitional housing is just that. It’s not meant to be a long-term solution, but as the member from Parkdale–High Park so eloquently put it, when the streets are safer than a home, it might take longer than 12 months to secure the housing, the supports, the placement for education, employment—whatever an individual needs to be able to move on to more permanent housing.", "Mr. Speaker, in my own community of Etobicoke–Lakeshore, we have a number of transitional housing facilities, some of which have this challenge about what happens after 12 months to some of the people who are living there.

That shelter serves women and families that are escaping domestic violence. In some cases, that 12-month period simply has not been enough.

  "text" : [ "It gives me pleasure to rise today on behalf of my constituents in Cambridge and North Dumfries township. So good afternoon to all, including Bev at home, who I know is watching on the television set this afternoon.", "I’m here really to commend and support the member from Barrie’s private members’ bill, An Act to amend the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. One of the reasons I commend her for her work this afternoon, and why I was very excited to come and speak to the bill, has been my former work as care coordinator for CCAC, the community care access centre. I spent many years in that organization as a care coordinator for hospital—when we would often get individuals in that were homeless. They ended up in the emergency department night after night with no housing to go to. When we finally got their housing needs addressed with transitional support programs and transitional housing, we noted that their visits to the emergency department did slow down. That was a cost savings for us, but it was also better for them. As a care coordinator, I then went to the community, and I ended up with the hardest-to-serve population: the chronic complex adult population.", "I wanted to tell you a little about Joe. Joe experienced chronic homelessness. When I met him, he had been in and out of hospital for the previous few weeks. He finally had a bed at the Cambridge Shelter Corp.’s The Bridges, which is one of our transitional housing programs within a bricks-and-mortar housing complex.", "Joe suffered from a number of different issues. He was in his mid-fifties. It’s not his real name. He suffered from alcoholism and diabetes, and because he was homeless he didn’t look after it. He was a double-below-knee amputee, so he was in a wheelchair. He was a chronic smoker; he had issues with emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In essence, he was a gentleman who also often had angry outbursts and was not always able to comply with the client code of conduct which is often posted in homeless shelters and in men’s shelters, so he had been banned from a few of those things.", "Very, very fortunately, he had a transitional apartment that was brought forward from the Cambridge Shelter Corp. It was a small one-bedroom apartment that he was in for a period of one year. Once he got into that housing program, then he got an awful lot of wraparound services to help start addressing some of these issues. But as the member from Barrie has pointed out, one year was not enough for this gentleman. Out he went at the end the year, and, within the first week, he was back in the emergency department, and the same cycle happened again. Fortunately, he was able to get into another transitional support service program in the same residence and he was able to then move into an apartment, where he stayed for a number of years to help address his complex needs.", "What Joe points out is some of the barriers and some of the issues and why they become a hard-to-serve population. The barriers are many, but I wanted to list a few of these from my own experience as a nurse with this population: mental health and addiction issues; inability to take medication at a certain time and manage their medications; alcoholism; lack of literacy; chronic pain; post-traumatic pain syndrome; refugees and new Canadians with a language barrier who had a number of chronic health issues needed these services; and as I said, inability to comply with a client code of conduct, so they may be kicked out of some of the men’s shelters.", "In Joe’s instance, with the transitional support program, he was able to move out of that, and it took longer than a year. Some of his wraparound services included, from Cambridge, a variety of services: literacy skills, life skills, a trustee program, individual family case plan—these are all services that are provided from the Cambridge Shelter Corp.—housing help, job-search help, linkages to other community resources such as Cambridge Active Self Help, the Self-Help Food Bank, the John Howard Society, employment options, job skills, and early years. The list goes on.", "What I wanted to point out was that the issues that bring an individual to the point where he needs that support system around him means that those are the individual reasons why one year in a transitional program is not going to be adequate. They need to address so many things, develop trust with their workers and have some fairly intensive case management to be able to bring that person to the point where they can transition out of that program and into a life that they’re able to create for themselves.", "I put my full support behind this bill. I do believe that three years is a much more reasonable program. It saves us money in the long run, and I really appreciate the chance to speak today." ],

Hydro One has a CEO. That CEO was getting paid $750,000 a year, which is quite a bit more than what our Premier is getting. She’s getting $240,000 a year. Last time I checked, she’s responsible for a budget of about $130 billion, and the CEO of Hydro One—a good man who works hard and does what he can—is responsible for an organization that’s far smaller when it comes to the amount of money that it’s responsible for.", "Here’s what has happened: The government has said, “We want to privatize 60% of Hydro.” So what they did is they took away the oversight from our ability of the officers of the House to look at what’s going on within this new, privatized hydro system. But thank God, we were still able to FOI through the prospectus they had at the Toronto Stock Exchange. We find out how much they are going to be paying this new CEO: four million bucks. They go from $750,000 to $4 million to run the same organization, and the government says, “Oh, but it’s the private sector. We’ve got to do that to be able to attract somebody to do it.” Come on. We had a person who was doing it for $750,000—which was well paid, thank you very much—and now we’re going to have somebody who is going to come over and run this corporation for four million bucks?", "This is under the legislation that the minister got up about today and defended herself by saying, “If only the NDP had supported our bill, we would have been able to work on this so much faster.” You would have had more people getting paid more money quicker. Thank God we held it up somewhat.", "But here’s the thing: In the end, it’s the public’s dime. The public says, “Listen, we don’t have a problem with people being paid fairly.” People understand that if you have somebody who works at a job and there are some skills involved, those skills are worth some dollars and you’ve got to pay those dollars. I don’t think the public has any problem with that. I don’t think anybody in this House has a problem with that. But to pay our CEOs the amount of money we’re paying them now in our public institutions is way out of whack with what is happening in other provinces across Canada. If you look at the CEO salaries compared to other provinces in Canada, a lot of CEOs in our organizations are being paid quite well.", "Now, the latest round we saw is what happened with the report by the auditor of the province, who came back and said, “Hey, you know what?

But here’s the one that really gets you going: The salaries of CCAC CEOs over the last four years have gone up by 24%. Now, who do you know out there who is working at any job in this province and got a 24% increase over the last four years?", "I look at the workers in your riding, my riding, in Hamilton and across this province. Let’s look at the private sector. You’re lucky if you get 2% per year in the private sector. You’d be lucky to get 2% on a settlement when it comes to bargaining in the private sector.", "In the public sector, a lot of people have been frozen at 0%. Teachers just went in and negotiated. They had to scratch and claw with the government in order to get 1.5% over, what, two years? So how do you get off, as the CEO of a public organization such as those CCACs, turning around and getting a 24% increase when you’re giving your workers zero or giving them 1% or 1.5% a year? It should be that you lead by example. If you, as the head of an organization, ask your workers to be more frugal in their demands when it comes to wages, because that’s what they’ve been doing, well, what’s good for the goose is good for the gander. They should, quite frankly, be doing the same themselves.", "But it doesn’t end there, Mr. Speaker. The Pan Am Games: It turns out that Pachi and his friends were doing quite well. I’ve got to say that it was pretty galling. We paid these people good money—all right, fair enough. They got paid a good buck in order to run the Pan Am Games, and we obviously want good people doing that; it’s a world-class event, and we need to make sure that we have good people organizing those games. I don’t begrudge people getting paid a fair wage to be able to do that and to be able to try to pull off running an effective Pan Am Games.", "But we gave these people bonuses, just for having done their jobs, that doubled their salaries.

They go to work every day. They don’t get paid a lot of money, and then they see somebody who is making $4 million a year to run a public institution. They see the head of a CCAC get 27%, I think it was, on average in increases over the last four years. They see people getting performance bonuses just for doing their jobs.

They don’t get performance bonuses of double their salary for showing up in the morning and keeping the plant going. For doing a good job, they get to keep their job and they get to keep the jobs of all the people who are working there.", "What’s good for the goose is good for the gander, so we’ve put forward this bill as a party, under my name. It’s a very simple bill that would essentially say that you’re going to cap the salaries of CEOs at twice—twice, I want to make clear; I said “two and a half times” in the question today, but actually it’s two times—the salary of what the Premier gets.", "The logic is pretty simple. If you look at the comparators across the country, it’s more in line with what’s happening in other provinces. But more importantly, it’s what’s fair. If I’m running an organization in this province that is far smaller than the province of Ontario as far as what the government delivers—the Premier has a budget of $130-billion-plus, and she’s getting paid $240,000 a year. It’s not a heck of a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. But I think at one point you have to have a bit of a reference, a bit of a reality check on what you pay other CEOs who run organizations in the public sector that are a lot smaller than what she’s responsible for.", "I’m just saying, as the bill is put forward for New Democrats, that we pegged the salary of those people at two times the salary of the Premier. I think that’s ultimately fair, and I think it allows us to go out and recruit the people who we need to be able to run our institutions, and to do so in a way that is responsible to the taxpayers.", "C’est important qu’on garde la confiance du public quand ça vient à l’habilité de s’assurer que ce qu’on paie nos fonctionnaires dans le—pas les fonctionnaires, mais ceux en charge de la fonction publique, qu’ils ont l’habilité d’être payés ce qu’ils sont dus; pas de question. Il n’y a personne qui va dire : « Le monde qui gère nos centres de santé communautaire, nos écoles, nos conseils scolaires et autres, ils n’ont pas le droit à un bon salaire. » C’est pareil comme n’importe qui d’autre.", "Mais quand on paie quelqu’un quatre millions de dollars pour gérer une organisation telle que Hydro One, quand on paie le chef d’une université, comme on avait à Western, un million de dollars—lui, il a eu une augmentation de 500 000 $ à un million de dollars, et il l’a fait lui-même avec les processus du CA de cette université. Ça ne se tient pas debout.

Pourquoi? Parce que c’est raisonnable. Deuxièmement, c’est pour respecter le public à la fin de la journée.", "This is all about respecting the public. People at the end pay their taxes, they work hard, and they want to know that when we go get the money from them through the various taxes they pay the province of Ontario, we’re going to respect them when it comes to how we spend those dollars. Giving somebody $1 million to run a university, giving somebody $4 million to run Hydro One or other examples that are out there is unreasonable when it comes to what people are expecting.", "Yes, we need to pay people a reasonable rate, the same way that we pay a teacher, a doctor, a municipal worker or whoever a fair wage. Nobody argues against that. But we need to make sure that the wages we pay the CEOs who run our public institutions are being paid at a reasonable rate, and we think it’s very reasonable to say that that be capped at two times the salary of the Premier." ],

It’s no wonder that Ed Clark and Premier Wynne cannot and will not confirm that electricity prices will not increase as a result of the fire sale of Hydro One, because they knew what the compensation packages were going to cost when they started this. Since the Wynne Liberals have removed independent oversight, Ontarians won’t ever know if we received fair value for this asset.", "It’s clear, based on the fat-cat payouts for the Hydro One transition team, that Premier Wynne is not in it for Ontario any longer and is out of touch with families. She doesn’t understand their daily struggles to make ends meet, including keeping the lights on. Her priorities are not those of Ontario. Premier Wynne should listen to the thousands of Ontarians who believe that this sale will increase their hydro bills and who are deeply offended when they hear of these enormous executive salaries.", "Speaker, I’m going to tell you the story I’ve told in this Legislature before of Jennifer, a woman whom all three parties met at the pre-budget consultations in Ottawa. Jennifer sat in front of the parties and she told us that she has to turn her electricity off every morning at 6 a.m., turn it back on again at noon, turn it off at 3 p.m. in the afternoon and turn it on again at 7 p.m., so that she can have enough money to buy food. That’s what has happened to the hydro system here in the province of Ontario.", "It doesn’t end there, Speaker. Last week, the Auditor General released her report on community care access centres, and it was shocking, quite frankly. We learned that only 61% of CCAC dollars go to face-to-face care, while the rest is spent on administration and bureaucracy, not the 92% the government claims. That is $900 million and five times more money diverted from direct patient care than they led us to believe. But just as offensive as that: CCACs’ CEO salaries skyrocketed by 27% between 2009 and 2013. Again, it gets to the crux of this bill and what it aims to do. It aims to prevent patients from being told that they must wait to receive the care that they desperately need, with 47% of patients not being visited at home within 24 hours of being discharged from hospital, as an example. The government failed when they allowed 40% of the funding to go directly to bureaucracy, and, as the CCACs cry poor and turn away Ontario’s most frail, that is unacceptable.", "The government must take action now to take an approach that puts patients, not administrative waste, at the centre of decision-making.

They also want strong leadership to ensure we’re providing those services that I just spoke about, that they expect and they demand from their government.", "When I think about that, that’s why I’m so proud to stand here today. I’ll speak to the bill in a minute, but I’m proud to follow the minister because that’s what I have the privilege of working with her on every single day, with her and her team.

First of all, it’s just an utterly blunt instrument. Secondly, it doesn’t consider the sector-by-sector issues, the individual-by-individual issues, that the minister is working on to make sure that we can attract the best talent but also deliver those strong services that the people of our communities expect. It also, as the minister pointed out, applies only to those folks who are making twice the Premier’s salary today, which is about $440,000. It wouldn’t touch those CCACs that he so passionately spoke about a few moments ago, and it wouldn’t address a whole series of other executives in the public sector. Our bill, Bill 8, and the work that the minister is doing, touches folks with incomes of $100,000 or more. The bill doesn’t even do what the member says it’s going to do.", "In addition to that, there are a few other things I want to raise. The government’s legislation applies immediately to new hires, to those who have changed positions and to all executives after a three-year period. The private member’s bill, in contrast, explicitly states that the cap would not apply to any salaries established before the act comes into force. In other words, it wouldn’t apply to salaries currently being paid in the broader public sector. So basically, most of the folks in the broader public sector wouldn’t get touched by this bill.", "The government’s approach to compensation control realizes that there should be mechanisms in place to ensure accountability and respect for any restraints imposed, and so we have compliance and enforcement measures, which the member doesn’t have.", "The member only talks about salary in his bill. There is much compensation that goes beyond salary. There are various forms of compensation. The minister is working on that. This bill does not address that.", "I started by talking about the fact that the members of my community and Ontarians expect strong services and value for money. The member’s bill doesn’t ensure value for money and it doesn’t ensure strong services; in fact, it could harm strong services.

While, as my colleague a few minutes ago remarked, we have in previous times voted against this, today we will be supporting it. It comes because of the fact that we keep seeing more examples of the gap between people who have responsible senior jobs but don’t earn hundreds of thousands of dollars and some who do. When you look at the growing sunshine list, the outrageous salaries at Hydro One and the increased pay of CEOs in community care access centres, this brings about the opportunity that there is a clear and important need for fiscal restraint.", "I’m going to speak about, first, the CCAC dollars, because the Auditor General made public her findings earlier this week. One of the things that was very disconcerting was that in her findings, she said that 61% of CCAC dollars go to face-to-face care. This means that 40% of the budget is going to administration.", "This comes at a particularly sensitive time for members of the chamber because we hear the phone calls. We take the phone calls of the people who are having their services either reduced or simply eliminated. So it seems to us to be a discrepancy that we cannot support when you have increases in salary in the nature of 54% between 2009 and 2013. This just can’t be justified. How can someone go from $181,000 to $277,000? For starters, that seems like a very generous base salary.", "We have, in York region, in the Central CCAC, 43 people on the sunshine list. While we recognize that it’s important that we have to set salaries to attract the highest-quality and the highest-skilled professionals, when you start looking at that argument that the government uses, you can find some interesting contrasts.", "I came across, in my research, a snapshot which shows that this is anything but the case. Consider, for example, the pension CEO pay. The three top-paid pension CEOs in the world—all three, the top three—are all from Canada. Their salaries range from $2.5 million to just over $7 million. Yet Canadians do not enjoy the highest rates of return on our investments.", "If you take that and look at the very poorly planned ORPP scheme, they are going to have to set a salary for a pension board manager. While the CEO of the CPP walks away with just over $3 million per year, he brought in a return of 16.5%. The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan CEO earned $2.5 million for a 10% return on investment. These are among the highest pension salaries in the world. The highest-paid executive of the AustralianSuper fund earns just about $1 million; the CEO of ABP in the Netherlands, $800,000; and the CEO of CalPERS in the United States, just over $400,000. I cite these as some examples to highlight the fact that multi-million dollar salaries for public sector pension employees appear to be a strictly Canadian occurrence.", "To attract the best and the brightest in the business, we simply do not need such generous salaries. Of course we need to reward talent and experience; however, we must also be accountable to the taxpayers. The question that must frame any salary is: Is this appropriate?", "There is a public expectation of fiscal prudence that must be respected. In this fiscal climate, where the Premier insists that the only way she can pay for her infrastructure plan is by selling Hydro One and creating an ill-advised pension, public sector compensation must be kept in check." ],

Instead, the people of Ontario have watched their government waste billions of dollars, from the gas plants to eHealth to Ornge and now the reckless privatization of Hydro One. This government, time and time again, has shown a staggering disregard for the people of Ontario and their hard-earned money. This bill is an important step in stopping that.

That’s $18 million that could have been spent on so many different things in the province of Ontario. How about repairing our schools or keeping them open in Niagara-on-the-Lake and Windsor; more nurses to help seniors in an aging population; and one that’s near and dear to my heart: supporting the Fort Erie Race Track?", "In that same year, the finance minister, Dwight Duncan, said about his government, “It will work to bring some of the overly generous compensation packages back to reality.” He went on to tell everyone that the government would move forward with the cap that is being proposed today by our member. I’m not sure why he only wanted to bring some of them back to reality and not all of them, but maybe his friends weren’t happy about their pay being reduced, or maybe he was hoping to get one of those packages himself.

In 2011, Maureen’s son Daniel travelled north to Temagami with few supplies, and disappeared. Because no foul play was suspected, the police were not able to conduct a full investigation. When there is no evidence of criminal intent, police do not have the authority to investigate. They cannot open banking records or compel information, like phone or text records. Many people do not know this. To quote Maureen:", "“When my son Daniel went missing in 2011, I couldn’t know the barriers I would face in trying to find answers.

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker, for the opportunity to speak to this important motion, brought forward by my fellow Kitchener-Waterloo colleague, to respond to the call of families in our area and indeed across Ontario to “enhance the tools available to law enforcement agencies in their search for missing persons while protecting individual rights and freedoms enshrined within the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.”", "This is both a timely motion and one that is close to our hearts in the Waterloo region. Following the tragic outcome to a mother’s quest to find her son—and his father’s, who is here today; Maureen and Don Trask, thank you for coming—who disappeared in the woods of Temagami, never to return.", "As you’ve heard, I speak of Maureen and Don Trask, who, after years of fruitless searching for their son that was continually hampered by a lack of provincial support resources, turned to her provincial legislators to bring her story and her call for support to Queen’s Park.", "As the member from Kitchener–Waterloo has detailed, Daniel Trask was 28 years old when he disappeared. It was the discovery of his car near a camp at Ferguson Bay that led searchers and Daniel’s family to comb through the vast forested wilderness surrounding the Temagami area. The search included divers, cadaver dogs, float planes and a volunteer backwoods rescue group from Michigan. But it wasn’t until this past year that the remains of the Waterloo man who vanished into the wilds of northern Ontario were finally and sadly discovered.", "In the three years in between, the lack of tools and increasing barriers that Mr. and Mrs. Trask and their family encountered as they looked for help to find their son prompted the Trask family and others to push for support through provincial government legislation.", "Indeed, that’s why we’re here today discussing this important motion, and that’s why Maureen, and Lindy Smith, who also encountered difficulties in her search for a missing loved one, visited our offices to see what enhancements the province could offer those facing the unimaginable pain of searching for loved ones who have disappeared.", "It was after their visit to my office that I wrote the minister, asking for the government’s response and action. As time allows, I will read a few excerpts from the November 24, 2014, letter:", "“I am writing this letter to you on behalf of two mothers who met with me to express their concerns regarding the need for a missing persons act in Ontario.", "“Maureen Trask and Lindy Smith, who have both experienced missing loved ones, have voiced the need for families to have access to pertinent information that will help in investigating missing person cases.", "“As both Mrs. Trask and Mrs. Smith advised, police cannot access possible locations or personal information if there is no criminal activity suspected. This poses a problem for families who are missing a loved one as there is very little they can do without access to this critical information.”", "The petition they have provided spells out the concerns clearly: Ontario does not have missing persons legislation; police are not able to conduct a thorough investigation upon receipt of a missing person report where criminal activity is not considered the cause; which impedes investigators in determining the status and possibly the location of missing persons; legislation exists and is effective in other provinces; and negotiating rights to safety that do not violate rights to privacy has been a challenge in establishing missing persons law.", "Specifically, the families with missing loved ones have highlighted the need for investigators to gain access to records in cases where crime is not evident. If authorities could access this information, they would be better able to execute timely and sensitive investigative services leading to the discovery of missing persons.", "As I noted, other provinces have already taken action by implementing missing persons acts, provinces such as Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Alberta. These provinces have been able to navigate missing persons’ information without violating people’s rights to privacy. It’s time we consider what Ontario can do to help.", "I can tell you what Waterloo region has already done to help. In the wake of the Trask case, the Waterloo Regional Police Service, led by Chief Larkin and, of course, our former chief, Matt Torigian, have taken steps toward a permanent unit that specializes in solving disappearances as they change the way they handle missing person cases—a first step towards a permanent unit that specializes in solving disappearances. Last September, Waterloo region police reassigned two homicide branch investigators to solving missing person cases on a full-time basis. The pair were mandated to focus primarily on finding the missing, including children and the elderly, while another officer was assigned cases involving teenagers. Now, that’s a step, Speaker, but it’s just one solitary step in one community.", "Today, we are looking to the government for province-wide responses and further steps that would help families right across Ontario. There are around 370 long-term missing-adult cases here in our province: 370 families searching for loved ones, including about 20 involving people from Waterloo region. As we’ve heard, the specific problem we’re hoping to address is that adult cases often exist in legal limbo. When there is no evidence of crime, police are blocked from getting court orders that could help solve their case.", "While the motion we are discussing today is general in its call, I’m led to understand that it is the Manitoba model of missing persons legislation that the Kitchener–Waterloo MPP is hoping can be replicated on this side of the provincial border. Thanks to forward-thinking legislators in Manitoba who identified similar concerns in searching for missing persons, officers in that province are able to use the Missing Persons Act to access store surveillance footage and phone records, as well as Internet and banking information, to track down missing people. Similar to the Ontario experience, previous to the Missing Persons Act, officers couldn’t access this type of information unless there was evidence that a crime had been committed. That’s why this Manitoba legislation allows the police to get specific information about a missing person when criminal activity is not suspected at the time the person is reported missing.", "In addition to the information that police can obtain under the act I mentioned a minute ago, the Manitoba legislation allows for a whole new realm of information and different types of court orders that give them the authority to get information, including a search that allows police to enter a dwelling or other premises to search for missing minors or vulnerable persons, and a record access order giving the police access to records that may help them find that missing person.", "In emergency situations, situations in which the police believe a missing person may be at imminent risk of serious bodily harm or death, police can make a written demand directly to any person for access to and copies of certain specific records that are in the custody or under the control of that person. It’s hoped that the emergency demand gives the police immediate access to certain records that could help them find the missing person before that person is harmed. The types of information that can be demanded under a record access order can also include global positioning system tracking records, inbound and outbound text messages, information about travel or accommodation, employment information, and personal health and school attendance information.", "Speaker, we do understand the inherent privacy issues, given the nature of the information being requested. It’s for that reason that in the Manitoba example, safeguards are in place to ensure a high level of privacy. Limits have been placed on the length of time the police can keep the information in their files. Internal access to the files must also be limited to those persons directly involved with the investigation. Personal information and personal health information obtained under the act must be protected and securely disposed of in accordance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act and the Personal Health Information Protection Act. The act also requires police forces to give annual reports on how they use the information.", "Again, it is this type of legislation that today’s motion is speaking to, to enhance the tools available to law enforcement agencies while protecting individual rights and freedoms enshrined within the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Given the heartbreaking stories that families with missing loved ones are forced to live through, there is no doubt that Ontario needs to do more to ensure that law enforcement agencies have the proper tools to search for missing persons.", "While the Trasks and families across Ontario who have faced barriers in their search for loved ones are calling on the province to help, it’s well past time that we act to answer their call. Again, I commend the member from Kitchener–Waterloo for bringing this motion forward, and I would ask all of you to support this motion today and support the call of so many who have waited too long for this province to act.", "Speaker, I would like to take the last minute to thank Maureen and Don, not only for coming to the Legislature today to hear the debate, but for their work. Obviously, you struggled for some time, worrying about where your son was. But when you met with me in my office, I know that you had concerns for other families that have had to go through a similar horrific experience. I thank you for putting the time in. Far too often, people are obviously concerned with their loved ones, and when they come to a conclusion or an end, that’s it. I commend you, again, for taking the time, putting signatures to petitions and bringing them to us as members of the Legislature.", "I thank the member for Kitchener–Waterloo for taking this up. It’s important. I hope we can pass this today, and I hope the government will take it back and act upon it, so that memories such as your son’s and the horrific instances until his discovery won’t be faced by families in the future. Thank you for coming today." ],

The member from Kitchener–Waterloo is truly a very compassionate person to bring the tragedy that occurred with the Trask family here and show that she is really a strong advocate and really cares about what she does and the people she represents.", "Unfortunately, Speaker, this issue is sometimes a reality for too many Ontarians. When a friend, neighbour or a family member goes missing, it is a huge loss for a community and for their loved ones. In fact, just a week ago in my hometown of London, a young woman did go missing. With little information about where she had been or who last saw her, people were really worried. Fortunately, she was found just a couple of days ago. It happens, unfortunately, too often for our liking.", "Speaker, there are many cases where children go missing, as we’re talking about today—loved ones and children—and some of them are found. Some of them are not found, and those are not conclusions that we ever want to face. In cases where there is no foul play, there are a series of barriers for the police and the family to help. There are barriers that face police and family, and they can’t really move forward and help to locate that person.", "My colleague from Kitchener–Waterloo is putting forward this motion after a young man in her riding who went missing in 2011. Maureen Trask, her mom and her dad are here today, and their 20-year-old son. They did an extensive search, as we’re talking about. I can’t imagine feeling how that would play out in your life, not knowing where your child is and not having the tools to actually look for them. It was four years later when they found Daniel’s remains through a group of volunteers, and I thank those volunteers for keeping the hope alive to look for Daniel.", "Regrettably, it’s not an uncommon event, as we talked about, here in the province of Ontario. Today in Canada there are over 1,200 missing and murdered indigenous women, and that’s something that has been a very important topic that’s come to light. The federal government has said that it’s not a priority for them, and I’m glad we’re making this a priority here by bringing this motion forward in Ontario. Other provinces have legislation, and we should implement this.", "This motion is calling on the government to enhance the tools available to law enforcement agencies in searching for missing persons while protecting the individual rights and freedoms enshrined within the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Other jurisdictions have recently introduced missing persons legislation. We’ve named those provinces, and I’d like to see Ontario be part of that list. I hope we can have support for this motion in the House in honour of the parents being here today—Mr. and Mrs. Trask—and show that Ontario is going to be a province that’s going to lead missing persons legislation." ],

There are too many people in our communities across the province who know the pain caused when a loved one goes missing. That’s why all of us in this House today must make it a priority to ensure that members of our communities, our neighbours, our friends, our family members—that anyone who goes missing is safely returned.", "We support the motion put forward by the member for Kitchener–Waterloo to enhance the tools available to law enforcement agencies in their search for missing persons while protecting individual rights and freedoms enshrined within the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Presently, missing persons legislation, as we’ve heard, exists in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta to assist police officers in locating missing persons. The legislation in those provinces authorizes members of a police service or any other person to enter, by force if necessary, a private dwelling or other place if there is a reasonable belief that the missing person may be located there.", "I think it’s important that as we consider this motion, we also look at how legislation has been implemented in those jurisdictions to see how they have worked to bring missing persons home safely while ensuring that citizens’ charter rights are protected. The history of implementation in other jurisdictions will inform what tools we could provide to law enforcement agencies to bring missing persons home safely, and how they have successfully been applied elsewhere.", "I want to emphasize and to highlight that our government did not wait for this motion to be tabled before taking up this very important issue. We’re already exploring various ways of ensuring that missing persons are returned to their loved ones safely while respecting the privacy rights of Ontarians.", "I know the member from Kitchener–Waterloo has previously mentioned that those who most often go missing are the most vulnerable members of our society, such as those who suffer from dementia. Just to insert a personal story here that really drives home the point to focus on returning the most vulnerable safely home: It was a summer ago, amidst one of the biggest heat waves Ontario had seen. I was out cutting my grass, and an elderly gentleman came striding down the street, well dressed, with a sweater on. He looked like he knew where he was going, but he looked a little clouded. We had a conversation, and while I distracted him with a cup of water and more conversation, my wife phoned the police. It turned out he was 12 kilometres from his house. He was a man suffering, perhaps, from the early stages of dementia. When his daughter came to pick him up, the relief on her face spoke volumes. We had a fairly well-organized police force that tracked people with dementia, so we were able to return that gentleman to his loved ones fairly quickly. I can only imagine the stress that the daughter and her family were going through for the few hours that her dad was out wandering in the heat, worried that he may never return.", "We’re working closely with our partners to ensure that those who suffer from dementia are able to find their way home, as I mentioned.", "Mr. Speaker, in 2013 our government launched the Finding Your Way wandering prevention program, in partnership with the Alzheimer Society of Ontario and police. This program offers resources, including a safety kit with an identification form for the individual with dementia, on how people with dementia, their families and their communities can recognize and reduce the risk of wandering, while supporting a quick and safe return should a wandering incident occur.", "We’re also working on a strategy for those who suffer with dementia, obviously. Last month, the member for Halton began participating in round tables hosted by the local Alzheimer Society chapters and LHINs, with stakeholders, to inform them and be informed on the development of the first comprehensive dementia strategy. These consultations will have exposure to all regions of the province, including northern, francophone, aboriginal, rural and urban. This is the first phase of consultations, and more are expected late this year. The goal of these consultations will be to consolidate recommendations and feedback to use as the framework for further development of the strategy. One part of the strategy will be to increase dementia education and awareness, to ensure quality, coordinated care for patients with dementia and support early diagnosis and treatment. It’s critical that we work to prevent those who suffer from dementia from losing their way, and to help them return home if they do.", "I’ll simply finish by reiterating once again that I can only imagine, as a parent, the pain that people can suffer and that our guests here today suffer when a loved one does go missing, and their desire to have the tools in place to make sure that their loved one can be found in a timely manner. Anyone who has a toddler who has disappeared for 30 seconds knows the terror that can fill your heart when you look for them. I can only imagine, as a parent, what it’s like to go months, if not years, wondering where your loved one has gone.", "I’ll leave it there, Mr. Speaker.

I know that, today, we want to focus on giving the OPP and the police new tools, but there are existing tools that are being taken away from the people of northern Ontario, and that’s wrong.", "We can see the goodwill in this House today, that everybody understands that if one of our loved ones goes missing, we should do everything we can to try to find them. But if you live in northern Ontario—and the family knows that well; they lost their son in northern Ontario—then the resources are not going to be there because the government has decided that both search-and-rescue helicopters should be located in southern Ontario, where there are more people. What does that mean for us in northern Ontario? What does that mean for the visitors who come to our beautiful bush and forests? That means an hour delay.", "Right now, hunting season is about to start. Harvesting season is in full blast. I can tell you that my riding will be full with hunters, gatherers, boaters, you name it—soon, snowmobilers. Yet this precious tool that used to be located at the Sudbury airport is being moved to Orillia. That means that, for all of those hunters—and make no mistake, Speaker: A lot of those older gentleman who have started a little bit of dementia still want to be out with the boys and go hunting. A lot of these elderly women who have started a little bit of confusion and dementia or Alzheimer’s want to go gathering with the women like they’ve done all their lives. And they are at risk.", "Every single year, the OPP search-and-rescue helicopter in Sudbury saved lives. Why? Because they could get there quickly. Right now, by 7 o’clock in northern Ontario, it is pitch dark. Really, a helicopter can’t do anything for us till the next morning. But had this helicopter been dispatched from Sudbury, maybe it would have gotten to that person in time. Frost has already started in northern Ontario. Sleeping in the bush when it’s zero degrees and you’re 90 years old or you’re frail? We know what that means. That means a death sentence to those people.", "I, too, will support the motion that has been put forward. I do want the authorities to have all of the tools at their disposal to find missing people.

Unfortunately, we make one step forward with the member from Kitchener–Waterloo’s motion and many, many steps back with the loss of the OPP helicopter to serve the people of the northeast.

I know that in Willowdale they’re very concerned about the sewage system, because of all the condos that are going up there. I get a lot of calls from people in Willowdale who say, “Are you sure we’ve got enough sewer capacity in our city? Is the province funding enough sewers for Willowdale as they build all these condos?”", "This is the type of important legislation that we’re dealing with this afternoon, to ensure that everything from the City of Toronto Act, which governs 2.6 million people—I know that Scarborough was once a very small place, but it is now part of the megalopolis, the mega-city. Some of us rue the day that that happened, but anyway, the City of Toronto Act deals with everybody, including all the wonderful people in Scarborough and all the wonderful people in Eglinton–Lawrence.", "Anyway, this is what this act is about: strengthening government. Government doesn’t run by itself. We have to keep fine-tuning it and investing in it to make sure it works for the people of this wonderful province of Ontario." ],

I know that when I first ran as an MPP, some of the goals of this are what I felt were important to me as an MPP, and that is to make government easier to navigate and to be able to access programs and information more readily, because sometimes, quite frankly, governments of all stripes, all levels and jurisdictions can be complicated. So this bill is intended to help with that.", "One of the pieces that is very interesting to me—I actually started some of this work when I was the Minister of Consumer Services and working with the then Minister of Transportation—is to amend the Highway Traffic Act to improve the safety and reliability of private sector non-emergency stretcher transportation services in Ontario. People say, “What does that mean?” What that means is that when you see something that looks like an ambulance driving around but it’s not really an ambulance—it doesn’t have the sirens going; it doesn’t have the typical lights going—that’s usually what we call a non-emergency stretcher transport service.", "This is near and dear to me because my husband, who has been quite ill for the last few years, has had to rely on this kind of service routinely for medical appointments and tests. We wondered, “Who does regulate these vehicles?” Because they look like an ambulance, but they’re not an ambulance and they’re not governed the same way ambulances are. The people who run these businesses, I think, most often are very reputable, but there has been a lack of standards in these types of vehicles. From a consumer point of view, people would sometimes think they’re getting the same kind of standards as a regular hospital-based ambulance, and that simply is not the case. These are non-emergency stretchers, and they’re operated in a private sector context. So I’m very supportive of those amendments to the Highway Traffic Act.", "The other one that I feel very strongly about is the amendments to the Courts of Justice Act to help efficiently implement new federal family legislation and to really recognize that families are no longer defined the way families were traditionally defined, and that different families take many forms. It may include same-sex partners. It may include single persons. My understanding is that these amendments to the Courts of Justice Act will help facilitate the new federal family legislation that’s applicable here in Ontario.", "Then, of course, here in the city of Toronto we have amendments to the City of Toronto Act to make it easier for the TTC to expand to York region and other neighbouring municipalities by adjusting provisions of the act. That will give greater collaboration between transit agencies across the GTHA, the greater Toronto and Hamilton area, and that’s very important because—I’m actually the only Toronto member who represents part of Toronto as well as a region outside of Toronto: Durham region. Looking at issues around fare integration and the right kinds of protocols or rules to allow smooth transportation, not just within Toronto but between these other municipalities, is very important, because as you know, Speaker, many people live in York region or Durham but they may work in Toronto. Being able to facilitate these provisions in the act will allow for greater collaboration.", "Those are just a few of the notable initiatives. I know there are other ones that are before us in this bill, but I will look forward to the comments from my colleagues and to get their fresh perspective on this, which has been, I’d say, kicking around for a while, so I’m very anxious to see this go forward." ],

This is important because we want to meet the needs of Ontarians with these public services that require a very solid foundation.", "Today, I want to talk specifically to the components that relate to the Ministry of Labour, the Registered Human Resources Professionals Act, 2013, where we are adding a new regulation-making authority to list human resources designations, and the designations that are currently listed in the statute are being replaced.", "Also I want to talk about the Occupational Health and Safety Act, where we are adding amendments to assist in the adoption of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.", "I felt that these particular areas were important for us to speak to. Currently, the Registered Human Resources Professionals Act does not contain a regulation-making authority to list human resources designations by regulation. The designations are listed in the act itself. Adding a regulation-making authority and moving the human resources designations—currently listed in a table within the statute—to a regulation provides flexibility in adding and removing designations under the act in the future.", "Of course, this is very important because we know that the RHRPA empowers the Human Resources Professionals Association of Ontario to govern and regulate the practice of members of the association and the firms in accordance with the legislation and its laws. Therefore, this is ensuring that they are able to update its professional certification framework to better reflect the role of human resources in the modern workplace.", "Certainly as I travel the province talking about the work that we are doing with respect to the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, I often speak to employers about the changing nature of work and the fact that work is changing. Ensuring that we have a professional association for human resources that has the flexibility to make those required changes through regulation is very important for us in order to continue to be flexible and adaptable as our labour market needs continue to change and to expand. I think that while that adjustment seems like a simple thing for us to do, it’s adding an element of flexibility within the labour market which is important.", "I also want to talk a little bit about the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the fact that we are making the amendments to assist in the adoption of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. The new standards are expected to improve worker health and safety. Employers and workers will have access to a broader range of information about hazardous workplace chemicals, presented in a standardized format considered to be easier to understand than the current labels and safety data sheets.", "I believe that this is something that is extremely important for our workplaces. I know that when I worked at Goodwill Industries—I was at Goodwill for over seven years—this was something that we paid particular attention to in terms of the health and safety of our workers. They were handling chemicals that were donated by individuals, and we wanted to ensure that we had a system of standardization so that we could keep our employees safe.", "Ensuring that these types of changes and improvements are made is very important in terms of how chemicals are handled, that there’s consistency in the labelling right across employers and that there is, obviously, training for the workers in that regard.", "I want to note that employers are already required to ensure that hazardous workplace chemicals are identified and that safety data sheets for these chemicals are available in the workplace and, of course, that there is safe use, handling and storage as well as disposal of hazardous chemicals. These duties will definitely not change. The main impact is that employers will have to ensure that workers are trained on the appearance and content of new chemical labels and safety in these data sheets. I think this is extremely important.", "Before I turn it over to my colleague, I recently had the opportunity to tour the Darlington nuclear facility—I believe you were there as well, Speaker—and we were looking at the refurbishment. I remember, when we were in that particular facility, that there was a significant area devoted to worker health and safety. All of the sheets were posted, everything was laid out, and there was particular emphasis on the role of safety in this facility, which we would all expect. So I think it’s that type of standardization and clarity that is needed in our workplaces to ensure that we keep our workers as safe as possible when they are handling chemicals. Safety is number one, as we know, and we want to make sure that, as we make these adjustments to this act, to Bill 85, we keep that top of mind.", "I want to thank you for the opportunity to address this bill.

But more importantly, he saw it in the interest of justice that he would get the court decision in front of people so they could move on with their lives.", "Our good friend Bob Sutherland was far more erudite, and he would spend endless weeks and months in trying to get the decision so he was absolutely certain that he had the law precisely as it was spelled out. It was a different approach in how you administer justice in the province. I believe that some of these amendments will give judges more authority to move more quickly in their decision-making. It directs clarified timelines for deputy judges to come forward with their decisions.

  "text" : [ "It gives me great pleasure to respond to the comments from the members from Kitchener–Conestoga, Algoma–Manitoulin and Thornhill, and, of course, our own Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport.", "I get the sense that on the other side of the House they want to have it both ways: “It’s a big omnibus bill” and “Oh, it’s just a bunch of housecleaning items. There must be a better process.” I have more respect for the bill-making democratic process than I’m hearing from the member from Thornhill. This is what this House is for.", "I think that’s what the member from Manitoulin, in his own frivolous comment that this changing the drapes—I hope that when he goes home tonight—I know he’s looking forward to being back in Manitoulin, and I envy him, because I was up in Manitoulin; it’s an incredible place to be. But I hope that when he goes back, he’ll help out around the house and do some of the necessary housecleaning.", "Yes, it’s absolutely true that this piece of legislation does correct some of the oversights, or the experience that we’ve gained over time with pieces of legislation like Bill 14, so it is important that we do make the government better by getting the housecleaning items right and correcting areas where we have seen that there has been change.", "The Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport spoke at great length about the trades, and he’s absolutely right about how important the College of Trades is to regulating and making sure that young people have an opportunity to get back. There will be opportunities within this act which will make that operation run a lot smoother.", "What I am hearing from the other side is that there is pretty much a unanimous agreement that we need to move forward. These are useful changes, and what I am hearing is pretty widespread support for fast-tracking this thing, getting it out of this House at this level of the debate so that we do get it to committee, and if there are some additional tweaks that we can make—some of the amendments that we are proposing—then we can have that fulsome conversation there, hear from the people of Ontario and make this a better bill to make this a better province to live in." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m happy to rise to speak on Bill 85, the Strengthening and Improving Government Act, An Act to strengthen and improve government by amending or repealing various Acts.", "We’ve heard a lot. We’ve heard it called an omnibus bill because it is so in-depth. The acts that are affected include the Courts of Justice Act, Family Law Act, Provincial Offences Act, Vital Statistics Act, Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act—that one scares me a bit—Employment Standards Act, Occupational Health and Safety Act, Registered Human Resources Professionals Act, City of Brantford Act, City of Hamilton Act, City of Toronto Act, Municipal Act, Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act, Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act, and, of course, the Highway Traffic Act.", "We do have to do housekeeping every now and then, and I understand that. I’m not questioning the protocol or how things work. I’m still learning how the bills proceed through all the different levels of committee and debate. But once we’re doing a bill like this, which really is, in a way, an all-encompassing, omnibus type of bill, why wouldn’t we do more?", "For example, we’re seeing so many cuts to health care. Why aren’t we streamlining the health care process? We’re seeing cuts to the front-line services of health care while demand is rising, the population is rising, the percentage of seniors in the province is rising. As well, something that we don’t really think about often is, the number of treatments that we can provide and the prolongation of people’s lives also add to the cost of health care. Ontario is lagging behind in terms of approving new medications that it will cover.", "So once we’re having an omnibus bill, why can’t we address so many of the problems that this side of the House is often bringing to the attention of the government?", "We just heard from my colleague that we have proposed amendments to make our roads safer and those amendments weren’t put in the Highway Traffic Act. Now we’re reopening it and making some changes to the Highway Traffic Act. Why aren’t these changes being made? He mentioned “look first and move over,” snow piling on the roofs of cars and, of course, my private member’s bill, which is saying that we need to address better incident management on our highways.", "So it’s not just about modernizing our legislation, it’s not just about strengthening, it’s not just about housekeeping; it’s about making life better for everybody in Ontario, ensuring that, as much as possible, people are comfortable, people are safe and people are getting a good education, a good quality of life, value for their taxes. I think that’s where we’re lagging here in Ontario. I think that we are collecting higher and higher revenue every year—and I certainly hear the frustration. All you have to do is go on social media today and do #carenotcuts. The doctors are very concerned. It isn’t just about the delivery of health care services for people who are just going to see the doctor for perhaps an annual checkup and usually get good news; it’s about people who are having an emergency—and we’re seeing longer wait times, again, in emergency rooms across the province. We’re seeing hospitals being built when there isn’t a budget to maintain the hospital, when there isn’t a budget to staff the hospital and when there isn’t a budget to equip the hospital. So I think it’s a little frustrating. And I apologize if I sound a bit frustrated, but I think that we can certainly do more to make things better in this province.", "I want to talk a little bit about what we heard earlier today about a family. Two parents were here whose son went missing and couldn’t be found. The reality is that we can’t always do everything for everybody. It’s just not feasible. We have limited funds in the province. But more can be done, and certainly more can be done when we consider the technology that we have now. Most people have smart phones with them, and there are tracking devices that can be used. Cars have GPS systems. Too often, after the fact, we’re very slow to make the changes that are necessary. There’s the Amber Alert system for a missing child, but perhaps we need to do more for missing adults, missing special-needs people, who perhaps are suffering from dementia or having mental health challenges.", "We live in Canada, where it’s a cold climate. It’s a serious problem if somebody goes missing in the winter. I think that we can certainly look at that technology and say to ourselves, if something like Uber can be developed, where we can see how far away an Uber car is from us if we have the app, perhaps if we have people with special-needs concerns, they could have some kind of bracelet, some kind of tracking device—maybe it’s something they wouldn’t even know about, but that’s a discussion for privacy—a chip in an earring or something like that. There are things that we could be doing as legislators to look at that technology. What could we be doing to make things safer?", "We go travelling, many of us, and I’m sure that we have noticed that other countries are investing in things like smart traffic signals, where they’re able to absolutely assess the traffic demands in different directions and adjust the lights accordingly. This makes things much safer. Some of them even have flashing lights to tell you, when the light turns green, how fast you should go so that right when you get to the next intersection, the light is just turning green. It means people aren’t going to speed, we’re going to have less pollution, we’re going to have fewer accidents, and it would just be safer for everybody.", "Even on the Gardiner Expressway, it’s very narrow and not well-lit, and we live in a city that is often very foggy. The Don Valley Parkway can be very foggy. We’re not investing in things like better lighting, on the guardrails. We have money for the Pan Am Games. We have money for all kinds of celebrations in this province. I think that what we are lacking is in prioritizing and ensuring that things are safer.", "We have to have those adult discussions, and when we’re doing these kinds of changes to acts, it’s unfortunate that politics oftentimes get in the way. We do often work well together when there are children in need, seniors in need, when there’s a health care crisis; we are able to sit down, have those discussions and see what can be done to improve the lives of everybody in this province. So I’m really hopeful that going forward, when we’re doing this type of an omnibus bill, we can have maybe more input from all the different critics, from everybody in the House, more of, “Well, we’re doing an omnibus bill. Let’s put everything of what we can make improvements to on the table.”", "It really is unfortunate that when we go through committee, we go through the amendment stage and amendments are proposed where stakeholders—even for my private member’s bill, every stakeholder that came to the committee and gave a deputation was in support. Yet we don’t see that bill being brought into the House. We don’t see amendments where there’s stakeholder support. We don’t see those amendments being put into the final piece of legislation, and that’s not what the public is paying us for—because that’s who’s paying us.", "Some of us actually may have heard this: Jim Richards on CFRB interviewed a teacher yesterday. This teacher was unable to accept that the taxpayers are paying her salary. Maybe that’s something that we have to all remind ourselves of in here: that the taxpayers aren’t just paying our salaries; the taxpayers are giving us their money to make the province healthier and stronger.", "We’re not seeing a healthier and stronger province. It’s been 12 years of this government, and instead of seeing less debt, we’re seeing more debt. Instead of seeing lower unemployment, we’re still seeing high unemployment. Instead of seeing a better health care system, we are hearing from everybody who has to access the health care system, including everybody who works in the health care system, that the health care system is worse than it was. We have an education system where a teacher goes on the radio and doesn’t know who’s paying her salary. We have an education system with some of the lower math scores. We’re having constant strife with the teachers. We have, I think, some of the best-paid teachers in the world, and instead of being happy, they’re still not happy because of their treatment by this government. How is that possible, that we have such a fantastic province in such a wonderful country, and yet our teachers are unhappy?", "We’re hearing from many of the trades that they’re not happy with many of the new rules and regulations, and they feel that they have to have licensing fees. Even if they’re a hairdresser, all of a sudden they’re being told to have licensing fees—or a gardener or a landscaper has to have licensing fees. They feel like they are literally being taxed to death and they’re paying taxes on their taxes.", "I think that maybe we could take some time and remind ourselves that we are not here to spend our money; we are here to spend the public’s money. We have to spend it wisely, we have to spend it carefully and we have to prioritize, and we have to think, on every single dollar that we spend, could it be better used somewhere else? Obviously we’re seeing the revenues go up, and yet the quality of life goes down, so I think that we have to think more like a business. If a business has to stay competitive and wants to stay in business in this world, they have to constantly be improving.", "Yes, this is an omnibus bill, and it’s to improve many previous pieces of legislation. That’s great, but it can’t just stop there. We have to continue and we have to look at everything about the way governments are run and the way decisions are made.", "We heard earlier today discussions about people whose salaries went up 10 times once they got a nice plum government appointment. You have to wonder—not whether a CEO should be paid $1 million, $2 million, $3 million or $4 million; we had differing opinions on that. But the question should be, what value we are getting for that salary? What is this person providing the province of Ontario and the taxpayers of Ontario to warrant that kind of salary?", "There are neurosurgeons operating on motor vehicle accidents, where they’re called in in the dead of night to rush into the hospital. My husband is an eye surgeon, and luckily we don’t see too many emergencies in the middle of the night, but there are always a few every year. Imagine being woken up from your sleep at 2 o’clock in the morning, getting into your car, driving to the hospital and having to operate on somebody.", "These doctors have to pay their overhead and their staff. They are treated like government employees when it suits the government, and they are treated as small business owners when it suits the government as well. I think that we have to really have that adult discussion, and we have to say, “These are the people who are there for us when we need help.” The firefighters, the first responders, police officers, RCMP officers, doctors, health care workers, nurse practitioners—they are there when we need them, and we have to make them feel valued.", "I think that that’s really the problem here. The teachers, even though we have probably the highest-paid teachers in North America, or possibly the world, don’t feel valued. Our doctors aren’t feeling valued. And the taxpayers of the province aren’t feeling valued; they feel they’re being ripped off. They feel that their expenses are going up. They’re paying higher electricity costs, they’re paying gas tax at the pump and they see that their infrastructure is still crumbling. They’re being told, “It’s because you’re not paying enough,” and they wonder where their gas tax is going to. They’re going to the hospital emergency room and waiting for hours longer than they expected, and they’re being told, “Yes, this present government brought in a health tax.” Where did that money go?", "We have a system now where we’re beyond paper. We’re really beyond paper, and now we’re seeing some of my colleagues trying out new technology—tablets instead of paper. I think that’s where we’re all going to be moving here in the Legislature. Well, that technology is out there, and there’s no reason why the public, with their money that they pay in taxes, can’t see where the money is going.", "Even on the flip side, it would be of benefit to the government if people could see the money that is being spent on them. I think I’m not alone here in hearing from constituents, “Well, I paid my taxes and I deserve.” I think we’ve all heard that plenty in—" ],

That would be much more environmental and of a lot of benefit to many of us here. I think that with all the new technologies it’s possible that the taxpayers could also see what value they’re getting for their taxes. There’s no reason why they shouldn’t be able to look online and put in their health card number and see for each year what they have been—I wouldn’t say costing their health care system, but what value they got for the taxes they paid. Because too often people feel, “Well, I pay $20,000 a year in taxes, so I deserve back.” Well, that calculation could be easily made, Mr. Speaker. If you start working at the age of 20 and you pay taxes until you’re 65 or 67, and you live to be 100—or these days we’re seeing past 100—it’s very simple arithmetic. It’s not limitless.", "We want to provide fantastic state-of-the-art health care for everybody in the province from the day they’re born until the day they pass on, but it costs. I think that people will think twice before they’re pushing for some kind of new project in their neighbourhood. A lot of people thought we should put in a bid for the Olympics right after we did the Pan Am Games, and that was a lot of money. I think that people will think twice before they’re pushing for these kinds of projects, if they really genuinely understand where the money is all going. The problem is that they don’t. And the reason they don’t is because we don’t. We can’t tell them if we don’t ourselves know. If the money is just going from the gas station into general coffers, then they’re not able to really understand and really see and really feel that they’re getting value. So, Mr. Speaker, I think that it’s great that we’re doing housekeeping. We’re hearing from all parties in the House. There are no issues with anything very specific in terms of amending and improving.", "One of the things that’s up for discussion is having the transit systems be able to be more integrated by the different regions, because the city of Toronto isn’t just the city of Toronto anymore; it’s the GTA and Hamilton. There have been discussions for years about having more of a conglomerate of transit systems, and it’s really time that we do that, that we create a one-fare system. It doesn’t mean it’s one fare, because I don’t think that you can go from Newmarket to downtown Toronto for the same fare that you go from Lawrence to Bloor, but maybe we have to look at what’s being done elsewhere. Too often this government is trying to reinvent the wheel, and all they have to do is look at what other cities are doing. They have different zone systems, and if you’re going through different zones, then you just pay a bit extra. But right now, where I am in York region, if people have to travel by public transit, they have to pay two fares: They pay a York region fare and they pay a Toronto fare. They figure it’s cheaper to drive a car, and too often that’s the case.", "We saw this government try to implement an electronic health care system. They spent over a billion dollars and achieved absolutely nothing. They claimed for years that they had a diabetes registry, but they didn’t even have the diabetes registry. I implemented health care systems in a medical practice, and all I can say is that I asked other doctors what system they put in and how it was, and that’s how I made my decision. Alberta was one of the top in the country in terms of electronic health care systems. Why this government didn’t just go to our neighbours down the road and ask them in Alberta how much it would cost us to purchase their system and pay them to implement their system in Ontario and train us in Ontario—and I can assure you that I would be very surprised if it would have been more than 10% of the billion dollars we spent on electronic health care." ],

We see a lot of waste from this government. We see a lot of scandal from this government. She talked about that.", "She talked about that we need to make sure that when we’re bringing legislation to this House, it is something that we can actually change here. The schedules that are in this bill—there are seven schedules. Over the seven schedules, it touches five ministries, and many members have spoken up and said that this is not the place where we really need to be taking time and debating an omnibus bill that could have been put in the budget. There was an opportunity to do that. The government chose not to do that, and now they’re bringing it forward.", "Though I have to say it is an omnibus bill and things could be done by regulation, I’m always encouraged and eager to debate any issue in this House, whichever member has put forward, so that we can talk it out and offer suggestions. I’ll be doing that in my next two-minute hits because, Speaker, the Ombudsman did a wonderful report on a portion of this bill, on schedule 7, which they describe as stretcher transportation services—very impressive. It feels like an Auditor General report, actually, what he touched on.

It’s something that should be better regulated, but I’d like to make mention that in large parts of the province it doesn’t exist. In my part of the province, ambulances do the non-emergency transport, so people who need to be moved from a hospital to a nursing home often have to wait hours and hours, and hours and hours, and I think that’s something that has also got to be addressed.", "We had a pilot project in our region, and the pilot project is no longer there and there is no more non-emergency transport.

A lot of times there are things that the government can offer in terms of changing the rules and regulations that would make them just as happy as or maybe even happier than if we increased their salary, and then that makes the taxpayers and the voters happier because we’re not spending more of their money.", "One of the things, including non-emergency transfer of patients, is that so often doctors are at one hospital waiting for a patient who is at another hospital to come and see them at the hospital where they’re working, because it’s so specialized now, medical care, and that patient is not arriving. Why aren’t they arriving? Well, they have no way to get there. They are waiting for their brother-in-law to come pick them up.", "As somebody who is in a health care type of family, I can tell you there have been all kinds of bizarre circumstances where a patient walks out of, say, Southlake Regional and they need to go to Mackenzie Health and it’s a half-hour drive and the doctor is waiting two hours, not getting paid, because doctors only get paid fee-for-service. In those types of circumstances, they are not. They’re on call and they are waiting for a patient to come and expecting them to come in half an hour. They drive to the hospital, they’re waiting for that patient to come, and if that patient decides, because somebody has to be dropped off at home, which is an hour away, on the way to the hospital, because that family only has one car, or they have to pick up a kid from daycare—the doctor is left waiting, and that’s not a good use of doctors’ time.", "So I think that more can be done to streamline and to consider the difficulties that our health care professionals face." ],

We have Bill 85, the Strengthening and Improving Government Act, 2015, before us, which builds on the former piece of legislation under—I think it was Bill 151, the first iteration. You have to say, for the love of humanity, really? If this bill did strengthen and improve government, I would be very happy. I would be almost ecstatic. However, in the interests of speaking to some substantive issues that are affecting people in this province, I will be focusing most of my comments on schedule 7 of Bill 85, which is stretcher transportation services.", "I think it is worth noting, Mr. Speaker, that these are largely housekeeping measures, necessary because of certain events, like tribunal rulings and so on, which render existing legislation obsolete. It’s really interesting because we’ve seen this tendency in the way that the Liberal government crafts legislation, that it’s overarching and has broad strokes about it, and then leaves a lot of the legislation up to the regulation side, which they can adapt and change as they see fit—which they could do with a number of issues and with a number of schedules that are contained within Bill 85. They could do most of what’s contained within this bill through regulation. In fact, they should have done it a long time ago, especially on schedule 7, which is the stretcher transportation services. So this is not a substantive piece of legislation, but it does have a really good title. I mean, full marks for the title. But it’s obviously compelled through regulatory changes and could be accomplished largely through regulation, as I’ve already pointed out.", "If you’re thinking about what people care about, and if people are actually paying attention to what we’re doing here in this House and if they are concerned about non-emergency transport services for medically stable patients, which schedule 7 largely deals with, then they may be interested to know that we’ve always believed that stretcher transportation services must be regulated and should be regulated to protect patients and their families. It’s a little bit of the Wild West out there with some of these transportation services. While people may be medically stable, they might not be so stable at the end of their drive to the hospital. There are a lot of people who rely on these services, and so regulation actually is very important to ensure patient safety. The regulation piece is completely and utterly long overdue.", "I think people would generally be surprised to find out that the transport of medically stable patients to a medical institution, to a doctor’s office or to a clinic for a transfusion or for treatment around diabetes—that right now in the province of Ontario those transportation services are currently unregulated. There are no safety and quality regulations and no accountability on this front. That leaves patients and their families with no certainty that they will get the proper care they need, no quality assurance and no limit on the costs, and no complaints mechanism.", "Why are we here, on the first day of October 2015, four years after the promise that this issue would be dealt with? That’s a rational question to be asking. Patients and their families obviously deserve better from this government, and there’s a track record here in the health portfolio which actually is not a very good track record. When you look at the Ornge ambulance scandal that we have not fully recovered from—and I think there’s still an investigation going on—patients and their families deserve better from this government. Unfortunately, these regulations have not been enacted. But they could be, right now.", "In June 2011, more than four years ago, the government first announced its intention to set quality and safety standards for stretcher transportation services. I wasn’t here in 2011, but it seems to me that that was pretty much in the heat of the Ornge air ambulance issue. At the time, the government said, “At the earliest opportunity, the government plans to introduce legislation that would, if passed, regulate the industry by setting core standards and requirements on transporting passengers between health care facilities in non-emergency situations.”", "Here we are, four years later, and those standards still do not exist. We have to ask, what is going on? This is something that can be done right now. The Minister of Health is a new Minister of Health in that portfolio, but the past Minister of Health could have taken action on this issue. There’s no excuse.", "Interjection." ],

This was one of the issues that came out. The Auditor General and the Ombudsman at the time highlighted this as a serious issue.", "There’s a need for regulation. That’s my point: There’s a need for regulation. The people who are calling on these unregulated transportation services need to have some assurance that the person who is picking them up is a qualified driver, is not someone who would be taking advantage of those people—because obviously, some sort of a reference check, you would assume, would have taken place—and that those people are reliable.", "Note also that there are no restrictions around costs. There’s no benchmark for what that transportation should cost. I’m just speaking the truth here. It doesn’t exist right now. There’s no benchmark for the cost. There’s no costing out. There’s no accountability on this kind of a service. So you have to wonder, how could this happen?", "Schedule 7 obviously falls far short of setting real standards for stretcher transportation services. This is part of the Highway Traffic Act; part of that actually is repealed. This part currently allows municipalities to pass bylaws and set standards for the operation of medical transportation services, as defined by the minister of the day.", "Clearly, where we are right now with this service, having no standards, as pointed out, is not sufficient. They’re not the clear and transparent regulations that are needed to protect patients. This is simply a legal mechanism to allow the government to regulate medical transportation services as commercial motor vehicles.", "Why would this not actually have taken place four years ago? This is a well-known issue. I know that I deal with this issue in my riding. I know that the northern members’ constituents will reach out to their MPP’s office looking for assistance, looking for guidance and often asking very tough questions. I think it’s safe to say that there are some outstanding issues in this regard. I don’t understand how the government could not say—they can actually do it right now. They don’t need this legislation.", "As I said, families and patients deserve far better than a convoluted, unclear, unaccountable and vague promise to make sure that hospitals follow guidelines, and to regulate stretcher transportation services as commercial vehicles. To us on this side of the House, the need for transparency is very clear: to protect vulnerable patients who need non-urgent transportation to get to hospital, to get to medical appointments and then, also, to get back home again. That’s what Ontarians expect, and quite honestly, I think that’s what they deserve. Four years after the government first promised the act, the measures of this bill fall far short; they do. Obviously, there are also no details in this bill about the regulations and guidelines being imposed on stretcher transportation services, providers, hospitals and LHINs.", "I think the Auditor General’s report that came out last week, Mr. Speaker—on page 15 of that report, I think you’ll remember that it was astounding for us to see it in black and white. We always suspected this, but there has never been any thorough value-for-money assessment around funding that goes into the CCAC system and its impact on patient results. That’s astounding, Mr. Speaker. Quite honestly, it’s shocking for people in this House, but as we rolled out some of that information, we found that people out there in the community who have actually had to try to navigate one of the most complex and layered health care systems anywhere in Canada were astounded to know that when money was being directed towards CCACs, there was very little accountability on how that money was spent. The figure that the Auditor General quoted was that only 61% of that funding was going to direct care. The question remains: What’s happening with the rest of the money? Second, how are we going to find out that that 61% actually making it to patient care is, in fact, positively impacting the lives of patients?", "You can’t discount the Auditor General. She’s non-partisan. She’s an independent officer of this Legislature. That review was five years coming. We were waiting five years for that report.", "We’ve heard anecdotally across the province—all of us have—about this issue. There’s a great disparity in the level of services. I will say publicly that those CCACs across the province are not created equally. Some CCACs actually had been doing a very good job of doing some internal reviews. But when you’re just looking at your own world and not comparing it to the evidence that exists out there on how to positively impact and get what I would describe as probably the best bang for the buck, if you will, around prevention and early intervention and all of those issues that actually would ensure that those dollars are being spent responsibly, with the patient first in mind—we hear a lot about “patient first.” For the Auditor General to come out and say that this kind of assessment and analysis has never been done was shocking for us.", "I look forward to seeing what’s going to happen with that report.

The municipalities, I think, are getting to that tipping point of frustration around the relationship between the province and the municipalities. I think that they are looking for some clear guidelines. At least tell them the rules of engagement on everything, really, from transportation to housing—and then the fallout around health care, because health care affects everything. Then you backtrack all the way back to finance. When you follow the money in this place, you find out the real priorities. I think that’s the way it works, and people generally do understand that.", "The critiques, though, around this bill I’ve already outlined, around stretcher transportation services not having those benchmarks, not having those standards. Why has it taken so long? Those are all valid questions, I think. But there are no details in this bill about those regulations and guidelines being imposed on stretcher transportation service providers. Basically, you’ve brought a piece of legislation to the floor of the Legislature and you’ve said that all of these things need to happen, but you haven’t necessarily said how or why they should, which I think is an important piece of the conversation.", "Not having a complaint mechanism for patients and families: I think this is really important. This came out in the spring, when we were looking for Ombudsman overview of the MUSH sector. You remember this: the MUSH sector. Municipalities now have an ombudsman, universities now have an ombudsman and school boards now have an ombudsman, but the hospital sector doesn’t. There’s no complete mechanism for patients and families around this issue, but the Ombudsman still does not have overview over the health care system, and that is a $52-billion budget item. It’s a huge responsibility to have that—not just the patient end of it, but the fiscal end of the responsibility spectrum.", "There’s no mention of accountability mechanisms for how the ministry would deal with contraventions by stretcher transportation service providers. There have been complaints. People need a clear avenue to complain, because if you don’t have standards and you don’t have a review of who’s actually performing the service and if you don’t have costing control, then you’re going to have complaints. There is some rationale behind this.", "The final piece for me is that there’s no assurance that contracts between hospitals and stretcher transportation services would be made public, and there’s no accountability for the public dollars that hospitals spend on stretcher transportation services. The ministry could not even confirm for us, when we did go through a briefing on this—to our health critic, during her briefing—whether these contracts would or would not be made public. They did not know the answer. That’s obviously a concern because this government does not have the best track record on writing up contracts. You have to admit: The contracting out and the privatization agenda of this government is astounding to us, and the people of this province are paying the price for that." ],

This government puts out a contract to develop an IT database around ensuring that these sales taxes are calculated correctly when a consumer, a citizen of the province, buys a used car. Last May, that program failed miserably and the government failed to collect $2.4 million. That goes back to a quality assurance control issue around developing those contracts, around ensuring that the government is going to get value for dollar as they contract out these services.", "What happens? The minister for consumer affairs and the Minister of Finance get up and say, “Oh, no, this is a one-off.” Didn’t they say it was a one-off? It wasn’t a glitch or a little small mistake like the SAMS thing was, because we know that that was not a glitch. That was a serious mess-up on the part of the IT company, which was once again contracted by this government without any quality assurance controls to ensure that the people of this province were going to get what they deserved, and that is a system that makes sure that the most vulnerable people in our province actually get the appropriate amount of money as they need it, because they are vulnerable. So what did we see with SAMS? We saw huge amounts of money going out to some people, and then other families, single mothers with three kids in my riding, got nothing. When you’re already living on the margins, an IT mess-up like that has a great consequence. It really does.", "We obviously have some concerns with the way that this legislation comes before us. These are regulations that they could actually just deal with themselves. It just begs the question before us: If you’re going to call it the Strengthening and Improving Government Act when it doesn’t do that, are you being straight up with the people of this province? This is a housekeeping bill. This piece of legislation will not strengthen or improve the government. You have a lot more work to do on that side of the House, particularly around fiscal, particularly with the way contracts are awarded. When the Auditor General finds that you are awarding winter maintenance road contracts to companies that don’t have the equipment to do the work, that’s an issue. I would rather us talk about how we can ensure that this government, when they look internally at their systems around how they procure services, is actually getting quality services.

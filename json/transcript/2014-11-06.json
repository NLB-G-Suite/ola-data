  "text" : [ "C’est avec plaisir que j’ai une chance ce matin d’être capable de participer dans ce débat. J’ai besoin de le dire : les libéraux sont toujours les mêmes. Ils ont des beaux projets de loi avec des beaux titres qui parlent de faire bien des belles affaires. Mais quand tu regardes les détails du projet de loi, tu vois que les libéraux sont très bons pour communiquer un concept à travers un titre, mais quand ça vient à être capables de vraiment faire les changements qui ont besoin d’être faits pour faire ce qu’ils disent dans leur « bill », c’est une toute autre affaire.", "Wynne, est un gouvernement qui était plein de scandales. On a vu ce qui est arrivé avec cyberSanté, avec les ambulances aériennes Ornge et avec les centrales de gaz à Mississauga et Oakville. Dans tous ces cas et d’autres—j’en passe—le gouvernement a été vu comme un gouvernement qui était non seulement incompétent, mais aussi comme un gouvernement qui avait des problèmes à, comment dire, faire des affaires d’une manière correcte.", "Wynne qui dit : « Je suis une première ministre qui est différente. Oh, mon Dieu! Je vais faire les affaires différemment. Moi, je ne suis pas comme ce méchant M. McGuinty. Moi, je vais faire les affaires d’une manière qui est transparente et qui inclut le public. Je vais avoir des conversations avec le monde. Vous allez voir que ça va être bien différent. »", "Mais quand je regarde ce projet de loi, c’est la même affaire qu’on a vue avec M. McGuinty : un projet de loi qui dit une affaire, mais qui, franchement, ne marque pas sur les points du titre du projet de loi. Je vais regarder le projet de loi dans une couple d’instances. Et vous allez voir, j’ai de très belles lunettes, données par ma belle-soeur, parce que j’ai perdu mes lunettes. Je les ai cassées. Ça, c’est ce qu’on appelle en anglais « my cheater glasses ».", "Vous allez voir; la première partie du projet de loi, c’est la question de la compensation pour les exécutifs qui travaillent pour le gouvernement dans leurs agences et à travers le gouvernement. On l’a vu à beaucoup de reprises : quelqu’un qui travaille comme président ou la personne qui est responsable d’une grosse agence provinciale et qui d’habitude, on va le dire, est payé une couple de 100 000 piastres. On a vu des instances où les personnes ont été payées jusqu’à 1,6 million de dollars de salaire, et où la personne précédente était payée bien moins que ça.", "Parce que les libéraux sont très bons à prendre soin de leurs amis, hein? Quand ça vient à leurs amis, il n’y a rien comme de s’assurer qu’ils ont l’habileté d’enligner un peu plus d’argent dans le portefeuille. Et là, le public regarde ça et ils disent : « Écoute, ça ne tient pas debout. » On voit quelqu’un qui fait un salaire qui est très élevé et on ne reproche pas au monde de le payer ce qui lui est dû pour le travail qu’il fait. Mais quand tu vois que le salaire payé avant, dans les gouvernements précédents, était beaucoup plus minime que ce que les personnes ont présentement dans ces postes-là, tu te dis : « Il y a quelque chose de différent et de mal. »", "Horwath, la chef du NPD, a dit qu’on a besoin de mettre ce qu’on appelle des « hard caps » sur les salaires pour s’assurer qu’une personne qui travaille dans ces postes-là n’ait pas plus que le premier ministre, fois deux.", "La première ministre est payée combien? Je pense que c’est environ 240 000 dollars par année de salaire. Je ne suis pas sûr à 100 %. Peut-être que quelqu’un peut me clarifier sur le montant exact. Mais on dit que si la première ministre ou le premier ministre est payé un salaire pour être capable d’être responsable d’un budget de 130 milliards de dollars, certainement une personne qui est responsable pour une agence avec des responsabilités très minimes comparées à celles du premier ministre—ça ne tient pas debout que cette personne soit payée quatre, cinq ou six fois plus que la première ministre. So, nous autres on a dit : « Pas plus que deux fois. »", "Voit-on ça dans le projet de loi? Non. On voit de beaux mots qui disent qu’on va faire quelque chose pour limiter les salaires payés aux exécutifs de ces agences-là, mais quand tu regardes les détails, il y a assez de trous dans le projet de loi que si on mettait de l’eau dans le seau, toute l’eau tomberait. On pourrait payer cette personne-là ce qu’on veut selon la manière de ce projet de loi-là.", "Sur le deuxième point du projet de loi, on voit, par exemple, que des personnes qui ont été congédiées de leur poste parce qu’elles ont fait quelque chose de mal—on voit ce monde recevoir des paquets de « severance » qui sont beaucoup plus élevés que ce à quoi on est habitué dans le secteur public ou dans le secteur privé.", "Écoute, moi, quand je travaillais à la mine, si je faisais une erreur et que mon « boss » arrive un bon matin et Gerry, mon « boss », qui était—comment est-ce que j’ai pu oublier son nom? Ça, c’est grave. Anyways, Gerry Savard, disons, arrive et dit : « Écoute, Gilles, tu ne fais pas un bon job. Tu t’en vas, je n’ai plus besoin de toi. » Il ne me donnerait pas deux ans de mon salaire pour m’envoyer parce que je n’ai pas fait un bon job. Il te paye le salaire qui t’est dû, puis tu t’en vas, tu as tes « severances », tes vacances et c’est tout.", "Mais dans le cas des libéraux, on a du monde qui ont été payés deux fois leur salaire annuel pour partir parce qu’ils ont fait quelque chose de mal. Écoute : paye-moi 1,6 million de dollars, puis moi, je vais aller gâcher un organisme quelque part et ils vont me payer 3,2 millions de dollars pour l’avoir gâché? Ça ne tient pas debout. C’est stupide.", "Est-ce qu’on voit quelque chose dans ce projet de loi qui va changer? Non, il n’y a rien là-dedans qui va changer.", "It tells me that the government is yet again doing what they do. They put a nice, shiny title on a bill. It’s called the Public Sector and MPP Accountability and Transparency Act. If I read that, I’d think, “Man, this is great legislation. There’s going to be transparency. There’s going to be accountability.” But there’s no transparency and accountability in this legislation. This is nothing but window dressing; it’s bafflegab. It’s exactly what the Liberals do best: “Let’s tell you what we were talking about doing over here,” but when you look over there, it’s completely the opposite.", "I just used the example of what happens with salaries when it comes to people working in agencies of the crown. You’ve got people who work at agencies of the crown who are being paid far more than what they would normally be paid if it had been under previous administrations, or as compared to other sectors within the economy. And what’s worse is that if they do something wrong and get fired because they mucked up, they get severances that are worth as much as two times their annual wage. Listen, if I offered Sally who lives down the street from my place a job for $1 million a year and I said, “If you muck it up, we’ll give you $2 million,” she’ll be running real quick to muck it up, if she can get the two million bucks and get the heck out. It’s a silly system.", "When we look at the bill, you would think that’s being fixed. You would think, “Oh, my God. That is all taken care of because Kathleen Wynne says it’s so. It’s accountability and transparency.” But when you look at the details of the bill, we’re still going to be able to pay those executives the salaries they’re getting and they’re still going to be able to negotiate those types of severances. That’s not at all what the Premier has promised the people of Ontario by way of the title of this bill or what she talked about in the election. I think it is yet just another example of the duplicity of this government. They love to talk a good line, they love to say the right words, but when it comes to the actions, they do completely the opposite.", "They’re the Tories who are in a hurry. The Liberals will do things on the right wing that even the Tories wouldn’t attempt to do. There are all kinds of examples of that. If you take a look at the privatization within the health system, there is more being privatized in the health system today by the Liberals than the Tories ever dreamed of doing under Mike Harris. There is more being privatized in the Ministry of Transportation when it comes to maintenance of our highways than even the Tories dared to do. There is more being privatized under the Liberals under energy and electricity than there ever was dreamed of even under Ernie Eves, who was talking about privatizing the whole thing. Even Ernie Eves backed down and got out.", "So I say that the Liberals love to pretend they’re a big, progressive party that is doing all the right things, but, Mr. Speaker, when you start to pull away the veil of what they’re doing, they’re Tories in a hurry. They do exactly the opposite of what they say. A good example, when it comes to transparency, is what they said in the last election. I think what Mr. Hudak did in promising to cut 100,000 jobs was not a very wise policy decision, public policy position, and certainly politically not very good for the Tory party, at the very least. But here’s the point: The Liberals campaigned against Mr. Hudak on the 100,000 jobs that were going to be lost. If you take a look at their own budget, they’re saying that 6% will be cut in each of the various ministries; and I would project that the revenues are not going to be as good as we think they’re going to be in the upcoming months because of what we’re seeing in the energy and resource sectors.", "So the question goes to the Liberals: How many people are they going to lay off? I bet you we end up by the end of this, by way of attrition and direct layoffs, probably laying off about the same amount of people Mr. Hudak talked about in the last election. But yet these Liberals tried to make it look as if they didn’t stand for that, they were completely the opposite. That is not transparency. That is just political bafflegab; and it’s politics, I think, of the worst kind because it makes people more and more cynical.", "We wonder why we get 49% of the people coming to elections. I don’t remember the exact number in the last election, but I remember that in the one previous to that 49% of the public voted in the provincial election—at least in my riding; I don’t know what it was everywhere else. Part of the problem is that people look at that and they say, “Why should I be engaged in politics? They say one thing and they do completely the opposite.”", "If we’re serious about providing accountability and we’re serious about applying transparency to government, and we actually did what we said we were going to do, I think the public would be more engaged. I think the public would say, “Hey, I’m getting good value for my tax dollars that I’m giving the government. The government seems to be trying to do a good job”—whatever stripe that government might be—“of making sure there is accountability and transparency for decisions,” but we’re not seeing that.", "A good example is what’s happened in regard to the daycare bill that we’re about to vote on later on this afternoon. We New Democrats are in favour of the bill that is being proposed. We don’t think it goes as far as it should, and deals with the issues of daycare for most parents, but it’s a step in the right direction. We’re regulating parts of the daycare sector that need to be regulated; nobody argues that. But we asked a very simple thing. We said, “Listen, daycare is an issue across this province. It doesn’t matter what community you live in.” I don’t care if you’re from northern or southern Ontario, eastern or western Ontario, if you’re a parent and you’re looking for daycare, a lot of you have issues.", "So why didn’t we take the time, as suggested by us, the New Democrats, and the Conservatives, to actually take some time to send that bill into committee so that the public outside of Toronto—and in Toronto—can have their say about what they see in the daycare bill as proposed and what they think generally should be done around daycare? The government said, “We’re transparent and we want to be accountable.” Well, in this case they’re transparent and accountable for two days in the city of Toronto. They’re saying, “If you have an issue and you want to come and speak to this bill, come to the city of Toronto between 3:30 and 6 at night and between 6:30 and 9:30 at night, two nights, sometime in a couple of weeks from now, and you’ll get to have your say.”", "What happens if you live in Cornwall, Ottawa, Sudbury, Timmins, Sarnia or wherever it might be? You have to either—“Well, maybe I’ll watch it on the legislative channel, if I can find it.” Depending on which committee room it is in, it may not even be televised live. And it’s not going to be run in real time; you’re going to have to stay up in the middle of the night to watch it. Maybe you can watch on the Internet if you’re lucky and you have good enough bandwidth to see it. Or you’re going to have to drive down to Toronto.", "You know what? There’s a huge province outside of Toronto. If you go to Kenora–Rainy River, my good friend’s riding, and you go to Fort Frances, it’s 1,600 kilometres from here. Who’s going to jump in a car and drive all the way to Toronto from Fort Frances for a 15-minute presentation to a committee here at Queen’s Park? You may feel strongly about the situation of daycare in your community if you come from Fort Frances, but my God, are you going to drive 1,600 kilometres to come here?", "It’s incumbent upon this Legislature to allow the committee to travel to some of these communities so at least some people outside of Toronto can have their say. Was there any transparency? Was there any accountability? Mr. Speaker, the government just used its majority and said, “No, we know best. We’re Liberals. I’m Kathleen Wynne. I am the Premier. I know what’s good for Ontario. Here’s a bill and if you don’t like it, too bad. I’ll use my majority and I’ll just push this thing through the House by way of time allocation and I’ll send it to committee for a couple of days in Toronto—done.” I think that’s a bit arrogant. I was thinking that the Premier was serious in her word when she said that, in fact, she was going to engage with citizens and have real dialogue about the issues that face us.", "I can’t think of an issue that is not as important to young families as is daycare. I talked about it the other day in the second reading debate. I’m a grandparent. Our daughters each have two children: a little boy and three little girls. There are two in each of the families. The ones who were in daycare are now out of daycare. They struggled in order to find some daycare spots. It’s very expensive. Luckily, our daughters and their husbands are doing well enough that they can pay for it, but they ended up in a private daycare because it’s hard to get into not-for-profit daycare; there are not enough spots available.", "Clearly, there are parents who are struggling for daycare spots. What do you do if you’re not as fortunate as Natalie and Julie, our daughters, who make at least a decent wage, who can afford to pay the daycare? What happens if you’re working in a job that pays 12, 13, 14 bucks an hour and you might be the only bread-earner in your family and you have to pay for daycare? It becomes very, very difficult.", "So I say, this is not about transparency, Mr. Speaker. This bill is more about the government trying to be seen as doing something on an issue where people really want the government to do something. They have a big, shiny title: MPP transparency and accountability act. If you looked at the title, you would think, “Boy, that’s a good bill, because it’s all about accountability and transparency.” But when you look at the details, it’s not there.", "One of the other issues we talk about is limiting the ability of lobbyists to do some of the things they’re doing now. First of all, I want to say up front that lobbyists are a necessary group of people in our system. You have to have professionals who work with organizations to do the work that has to be done to prepare them to lobby governments and opposition, to be able to move their agenda forward. That’s what lobbyists are. They shouldn’t be seen as a negative.", "But we have rules here that allow the former Premier, Mr. McGuinty, who is working for an educational software company that his government gave money to when he was Premier. When he was Premier, his government gave money to this company to do work on some educational software—whatever it is they do in that company—and now Mr. McGuinty is hired as their lobbyist. I think the average person would look at that and say, “My God, is that right? Does it make any sense that the guy who gave them money gets hired by the company that got the money?” It doesn’t look good on the surface.", "There has to be some sort of mechanism where you can’t do that kind of thing, or at least have a real cooling-off period of a couple of years that you cannot be involved in something you were directly involved with as a government member or as a member of this assembly or as a Premier or as a cabinet minister. I’m not saying that an MPP who leaves this place couldn’t get a job as a lobbyist somewhere, but there have to be some sort of conflict-of-interest guidelines that say you can’t be lobbying on things that you were responsible for when you were in government, because it does look to the public, at least on the surface—it doesn’t smell well, I guess, is the only way I would put it.", "The other part of this bill is that they’re posting MPPs’ expenses. This is supposed to be something that’s really great. So we’re now going to post the expenses of myself and all of our colleagues when it comes to the two budgets we have: We have one budget to run our constituency offices, which we call our global budget, and we also have our travel expenses. We get money to travel to and from the riding.", "So a person like myself, I take an airplane ride once a week. The government pays for that, including the taxi. They’re saying, “Look at this. We’re going to be posting it. It’s such a wonderful thing.” It was information that was already available to anybody who wanted to find it. It was already on government websites. All we’re doing is making it a little bit easier for people to find. But let me tell you: People in my constituency who are looking for how much I spend on travel or in my global budget, as with every member in the assembly, never have a problem trying to find that, because your local papers right away will publish what it is that you spent the year before. Normally, there’s an article that is written about how Gilles Bisson is either the highest- or second-highest-spending member when it comes to travel. Normally, Kenora–Rainy River is number 1 and I’m number 2 or I’m number 1 and Kenora–Rainy River is number 2. Well, you know, surprise, surprise: My colleague and I live far away, and we take airplanes to come to work because we’re more than eight hours’ drive.", "In your case, how many hours’ drive would it take you to get here? Two days?" ],

Everybody knows how much I spend every year, but somehow this is seen as transparency because it’s in the bill. It was already public information. It wasn’t as if nobody could find it. All you had to do was go to the legislative website, go searching around and you can find the report that lists how much each and every member in this assembly charged in travel and how much we charge in our global budgets to pay our staff and buy paper and pay rent.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, I say this is a case where the government is saying they’re going to do one thing, when it comes to having a really nice title that says it’s transparency and accountability, and be seen as doing something, but in fact the details leave a lot to be desired." ],

Many of them talked about the need to make sure that government is accountable, that it’s transparent, that we get value for taxpayers’ dollars. I know from my experience in business and in the private sector that one of the best ways to ensure value for dollars is that the information that shines light on how we spend those dollars is so important.

I think this is important. I think the people of my community and all our communities expect no less.", "It requires all institutions covered by the provincial municipal freedom-of-information legislation to securely preserve and prohibit the wilful destruction of records, to make sure that information will always be present and available.", "It gives the government greater oversight over the air ambulance service providers.", "It allows the government to appoint a patient ombudsman to respond to complaints and to eventually help to make changes to improve our health care system.", "It’s a broad-ranging bill, Mr. Speaker.

There is so much in the bill that was already happening, so much more that could have been done; really, it’s a form of distraction.", "For example, air ambulance: All the measures in this bill would not have changed anything. The government knew very well that there were serious problems going on. The government received an audit that they requested. They hired a company, Meyers Norris Penny, and had them do an audit. The audit clearly stated there were a number of problems. They received this document. I was in the committee; I was shocked at how exhaustive that report was. It went through and showed all the problems that existed—this is years ago; this was 2009, well before the scandal broke—and they did nothing about it. Really, what needs to happen are some systemic changes to the overall structure, the way in which this government responds to red flags, the way this government responds to problems.", "Speaking about the Ombudsman, it’s a great idea to expand the scope of the Ombudsman, but why is the government not expanding it to the area where there is so much in terms of scandal, like the health sector—eHealth, Ornge? These are some serious concerns, and particularly serious because health is something that everyone is concerned about. So why is this government appointing a patient ombudsman when we know very well that the Ontario Ombudsman is one of the most skilled individuals in terms of oversight?

C’est très apprécié que mes collègues ont pris la chance d’être capable de répliquer à mon discours en français. N’ayez jamais peur de faire ça.

Quand on a un nouveau arrivé au Canada ou un francophone du Québec qui arrive ici en Ontario, puis il parle l’anglais, on ne s’inquiète pas s’il ne parle pas bien l’anglais. On essaye de comprendre ce qu’ils disent, et eux autres pratiquent et éventuellement ils apprennent l’anglais et puis ils deviennent plus courants. Un des problèmes qu’on voit dans le français des fois, c’est que les francophones, eux-autres-mêmes, vont entendre quelqu’un qui parle le français, puis parce que la personne ne prononce pas bien les mots ou a des problèmes à rechercher certains termes, ils vont la décourager d’utiliser le langage.", "Moi, je prends l’approche complètement inverse. Utilisez votre français du mieux que vous êtes capables. Si vous avez des anglicismes dans le langage ou des mots que vous n’avez pas compris, en utilisant le langage et en demandant des questions, éventuellement, on devient plus courant. So, l’affaire qui est importante, c’est l’utilisation du langage et c’est quelque chose qui est très important.", "Again, thanks to my colleagues for replying in French. I do want to say, though, that I really do see this bill as essentially a communications exercise on the part of the government. This is transparency and accountability by title; that’s really what this bill is. It’s not about the things that we need to do to really make transparency and accountability work.", "As I said in my speech, and it was repeated by the member from Thornhill, in fact, people are disconnected and don’t participate in politics exactly because politicians and governments tend to say the right things but take very little action on the things that they say they’re going to do." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to have an opportunity to address Bill 8. It is of course the curiously titled Public Sector and MPP Accountability and Transparency Act. I say “curious” as I don’t think there has ever been a more clear example in this House of a government saying one thing and doing another. Perhaps one would say they’re talking out of both sides of their mouths.", "“Accountability” and “transparency” are two words with such importance when it comes to democratic governments, and certainly concepts that we on this side of the House support wholeheartedly. Yet these two words seem to lose all meaning when dragged through the mud by the Wynne Liberals. I feel it’s important, as we move through this legislation, to understand just what accountability and transparency mean and how they apply when it comes to expected outcomes for this legislation under the current Wynne regime.", "Let’s take a clear look at these two words. We’ll take “accountability” first. I have taken the opportunity to look it up, and according to Merriam-Webster, accountability is defined as, “An obligation or willingness to accept responsibility or to account for one’s actions.” Then they provide an example, which I will read as well, as it applies to this situation: “public officials lacking accountability.” I didn’t write that, Speaker, but it seems someone at Merriam-Webster must have a familiarity with this Ontario Liberal government.", "So accountability is a “willingness to accept responsibility or to account for one’s actions.” I submit that this willingness is clearly absent in this House. I would advise that without that willingness to accept responsibility, there is no legislation wording that will restore the principle of accountability from a government whose actions continue to ensure it is not accountable.", "Just in the last couple of weeks, we see this government, despite the announcements surrounding this legislation, moving again and again to ensure it cannot be held to account. Look at the legislation that is being rammed through this House at rapid, unaccountable speed. Let’s take Bill 15, the Fighting Fraud and Reducing Automobile Insurance Rates Act, 2014, where we just had one day of public hearings here in Toronto following time-allocated debate last week. Then one more quick day of clause-by-clause before it’s to be returned to the House and ramrodded through to shut down any sense of democratic input. How is this democratic? How is this accountable?", "Last week it was Bill 18, the Stronger Workplaces for a Stronger Economy Act. It’s the same story here, Speaker: time-allocated to shut down debate, one day of hearings here in Toronto to shut down input, one day of clause-by-clause to shut down amendments, and quickly back to the House. In the end, we’ll be left with neither stronger workplaces nor a stronger economy, but we will have a piece of legislation that says we do. Welcome to Premier Wynne’s Ontario, where government talks about doing the right thing but fails to walk the walk.", "Talk is cheap, Speaker, and the people of Ontario deserve a government that tells them what they’re going to do and then actually does it. That’s what the people of Ontario deserve, yet we’re left with a government that brings forth snappy-titled legislation like the accountability and transparency act when its actions are clearly anything but accountable and transparent.", "Of course, the fast-tracking of legislation follows hard on the heels of the government’s complete lack of accountability when it comes to allowing the people of Ontario a glimpse into the deals they’ve made to tie us to the white elephant known as MaRS, just out those front doors. Time and again, our members worked in committee to draw government out, to hold it to account on its MaRS dealing. Time and again, we were met with a solid brick wall of deniability.", "My colleague from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington was persistent in his questioning in estimates, prodding the minister to simply provide the documentation, the agreements made by this government that have left Ontario taxpayers holding onto a multi-million dollar bill that I don’t even think government members know the total of. We’re still waiting for those documents, those agreements, while government hides behind their new buzzwords “commercial sensitivity” to keep the truth from getting out.", "This is a project that has left us paying $65 million to buy out an American real estate partner while also paying interest on a $224-million loan issued by the province itself to get a second tower built in the first place. The minister wouldn’t even tell us how much we may end up paying for the project in the end. It’s hardly accountable, Speaker. And it makes me question the government’s intentions when it comes to inserting accountability into this legislation.", "What about those gas plants? I don’t think there is anyone in the entire province who would consider this government’s actions in the wake of the Liberal gas plant scandal to be accountable. It’s completely the opposite, and the games continue. Seemingly emboldened by their new majority status, this government is doubling down on its unaccountability when it comes to the gas plant debacle. Where is the accountability when the government uses its majority to refuse the justice committee from hearing the testimony of Peter Faist and Laura Miller? All those in opposition stood in a united front to increase accountability with respect to the two cancelled gas plants while, of course, the government voted to shut us down. It’s more of the same cavalier attitude that cost taxpayers $1.1 billion, all in the name of winning the 2011 general election.", "You’ll have to forgive us in opposition for being skeptical of the government’s intentions when it puts legislation before the House with laudable principles of accountability and transparency while completely ignoring those principles when the rubber hits the road. The frustrating part for us in opposition and those across Ontario watching this play out is that it doesn’t seem to matter what legislation is in place to hold the government to account and ensure transparency. This government simply pays lip service and goes on its merry way doing what it wants when it wants and sticking taxpayers with the bill.", "For instance, in the case I just mentioned—the government’s refusal to allow Mr. Faist and Ms. Miller to appear in front of a committee—their testimony would not have even been required if the government had behaved in accordance with legislation already on the books in the first place. You see, there was already legislation in place to protect public archives and public record-keeping before someone from government ordered the destruction of emails. Obviously, that legislation was completely ignored, so it’s questionable how the simple addition of another clause in this legislation is now going to protect future records.", "You can change the legislation but a leopard or cheetah doesn’t change its spots. In fact, a number of different pieces of legislation to bring increased and enhanced accountability and transparency have been enshrined into law right here in this assembly, but they’ve all been ignored. After every scandal, it’s the same routine:", "(1) introduce legislation to make it appear like government and its agencies are finally going to do things right: be accountable, be transparent, provide proper oversight;", "(2) pass the legislation and announce all is right again, and the government can be trusted—don’t worry;", "(3) wait until the people aren’t looking and engage in the same unaccountable actions that got you into trouble in the first place—cue crisis;", "(4) stir and repeat.", "We had legislation to prevent an OLG-like crisis from ever happening again. Before you knew it, there was eHealth. Then eHealth crisis-prevention legislation gave way to Ornge, and Ornge begat the gas plants. The cycle just goes on and on, and at no time does it appear that this government actually gets it, actually understands what it is doing to prevent the very accountability and transparency that it pretends to defend. If it sounds frustrating, that’s because it is. We have had more than a decade of this back-and-forth gamesmanship, and now we see the latest chapter with Bill 8.", "Let’s get back to the so-called accountability and transparency act. We have dealt with the accountability piece, or lack thereof, so now what about transparency? Again, when we flip through the Merriam-Webster, we learn that transparency is defined as “The quality or state of being transparent, free from pretense or deceit, characterized by visibility or accessibility of information, especially concerning business.” These are all qualities we want to see in government, all qualities we should aspire to in this House, and while I support the initiatives towards transparency, I question once more the government’s ability to make good on this goal.", "I already told you about the MaRS questioning in committee. So, too, in the House during question period, we in the official opposition were stymied by a government and a Premier that simply refuse to be responsible, to be transparent. After the minister refused to release the business case for the MaRS loan and other relevant information related to the MaRS bailout in committee, Premier Wynne herself followed up in this House, refusing to release or even acknowledge that a business case existed that showed the MaRS phase 2 bailout of over $309 million was in fact in the best interest of the Ontario taxpayers—they want to know.", "This is a Premier that was supposed to be changing the scandal-plagued Liberal government, supposed to be ushering in a new era of openness and transparency. This is simply not the case. It makes me question the purpose of legislation like Bill 8 if it is going to be completely ignored once it’s on the books, just like so many others in the past. I’m further concerned when I see members of this government—new members of cabinet who we hope aspire to be different when it comes to transparency—show that in reality it is the same old same old for a government that refuses to meet its responsibilities.", "That concern was clearly front and centre again in estimates last week when we had the Minister of Transportation appear before the committee to answer questions on his ministry’s plans moving down the road, a very important file as we continue to hear government make a pledge of $29 billion to spend over the next 10 years on critical pieces of infrastructure—but I will remind them that they have been around for about 11.", "This minister was asked for documentation, business plans and background material for issues, including high-speed rail from London to Kitchener to Toronto, maybe even including Windsor, the UP Express—the high-speed electronic link from downtown Union Station to the airport—LRT and more. Yet, at every turn, he refused to provide the committee with requested documentation. Further, he refused to even provide timelines on projects for his government announcements that they’ve actually previously announced, indicating, “I’m not here to announce specific timelines or to make confirmations.”", "And here is where it gets a little strange. When I asked the minister to confirm the timeline announced by his predecessor for all-day, two-way GO service to Kitchener-Waterloo in five years, his answer seemed to indicate that Liberal commitments during an election are not commitments at all. Now, I don’t want to mislead or put words into the minister’s mouth so I will read his reply, and you can be the judge.", "He said, “You would understand, as a veteran member of this Legislature, that there are a lot of commitments that governments make, that parties make, that individual MPPs make that are aspirational in nature....” There it was, in front of the entire committee: an admission that commitments of this government are not actually commitments at all but in fact are aspirations—aspirations.", "As I said in the House to follow up on that questioning, where we come from on this side, commitments are your word; they’re your promise. Where we come from, there is of course a four-letter word for those who dress up their commitments as aspirations.", "I put it to the members opposite: Here we are. After years of scandal, after years of legislation paying lip service to concepts of transparency and accountability, after one of your own cabinet ministers admits that your commitments aren’t what they’re made out to be, how are we supposed to believe you when you tell us that your latest for-sure, we-really-mean-it-this-time commitment to transparency and accountability is anything but another measure to divert the public’s attention while you move on to your next scandal? And I’m sure it will be a good one.", "How are we supposed to believe that this piece of legislation, as laudable as some of its goals may be, will end up actually instilling the principles of transparency and accountability instead of being ignored like the long line of ignored ethics proposals that litter the twisted trail this government has left for us to clean up?", "I know there were comments earlier that talked about the Ornge scandal. We all saw, after the committee spent hours and hours and hours interviewing folks and coming up with a report—I’d like to specifically thank my colleagues, especially retired MPP Frank Klees, from Newmarket–Aurora, for his extremely great work on this file to bring and shed some light for Ontarians on just what happened at Ornge and how it got so bad.", "But how careless the former Minister of Health was, when she was in fact warned, given a letter identifying all the red flags at Ornge. I’m not sure if she just has an inability to manage correspondence, or if she simply ignored the warning signs that could have prevented unnecessary deaths and tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of dollars that were squandered by Ornge.", "We can’t forget, of course—" ],

I just mentioned Ornge and eHealth.", "We understand that this is simply another attempt by government to deflect from the decade-plus of scandal we are all paying for.

I can assure you, when my private member’s bill comes forward, the title will match what’s in the text.", "I spoke for quite a long time on the fighting fraud and reducing auto insurance motion, or bill, that came forward a couple of weeks ago, or a week ago. I love the title, so I read that title and I got into the bill, and I had some support from researchers etc. Then I looked into it and it was really nothing about that. It was about having an appeal process—the courts—taken away as a right of claimants, and it was about reducing the interest rate that insurance companies have to pay for pain and suffering from the time a claim is awarded until the time it’s paid. So that bill didn’t really match the title.", "Then I take a look at this bill that’s in front of us today, the Public Sector and MPP Accountability and Transparency Act. I believe that every single member of this House wants exactly that. Every single person in this province wants exactly that. The problem is, the bill does not go far enough. We take a look, for example, at the salaries of public sector workers. How in-depth are we going? Are we attacking the severance packages? No. Are we attacking the bonus systems that up the salary that they actually get at the end of the year? I didn’t see it in there.", "Again, if we talk about transparency and accountability—and then there’s the whole piece about not destroying information.

The areas that I did earlier note—those are strong, those are good. But let’s get into some of the areas that are really important and where the accountability is simply lacking or the transparency is lacking.", "One of the first examples I’ll turn to is the broader public sector executive compensation component of this bill. Now, it’s good that you acknowledge there’s a problem. Thank you. That’s something that we salute and recognize, that you realize there’s a problem. The public has complained about it, that there seems to be this runaway executive compensation in the public sector. The problem with this bill is, what is the solution that the bill is proposing? The bill says, “Hey, we’re going to obtain in-formation. Once we get that information, then we’re going to create a framework and then we’ll do something about it.” That’s not really transparency. That’s not really accountability. That’s saying, “We’ll do some stuff, we’ll put some stuff together and maybe we’ll come up with some stuff.” It’s very vague. It’s not really anything concrete.", "Why couldn’t any of this be done without a bill? You could review information of public sector salaries for executives. You’re paying them, so you could review that information. There’s nothing stopping you from doing that. There’s nothing stopping you from putting together a framework. You could do that. There’s nothing stopping you from putting together a policy on this. All of those steps could easily be taken without a bill.", "What makes it cynical is when you say, “We’re taking action on this. We’re taking some steps on this,” and your actions are not really actions. There’s stuff that you can do without a bill, and the bill’s not really doing anything; there’s no cap. Then, you say, “Okay. We’re not in a position to make a cap yet.” That’s fair, but then you can’t put it into the bill and say, “Hey, we’re going to take action on broader public sector executive compensation. We’re going to do something about it.” You may in the future, and I hope you do, but you’re not right now. This is not taking any steps. This is nothing that you couldn’t otherwise do. So that’s a concern.", "We proposed a hard cap. That’s a starting place, saying, “Listen, there needs to be a hard cap in this province. For a public sector executive, there’s got to be some level of a cap.” We have caps on the Premier. The Premier who runs the entire province has a clear cap. Why can’t we put a cap in place for executives? That seems to be a logical step, and that would be some action. You could say, “We’re putting in a concrete cap. We’ll review and modify it given the expertise and given the area we’re dealing with. If it’s in the health sector or the energy sector, we’ll deal with it appropriately, but here’s a general guideline for a cap that’s subject to some changes.” That would be a step, and I wouldn’t be able to criticize that. I’d say, “Hey, listen, that’s a step. You’ve definitely taken something bold and you’ve put in a cap.” But without a cap, without even a framework for a cap, just saying, “We’re going to obtain information to then maybe do a framework for something in the future” really is not doing a lot.", "Schedule 2, amendments to the Ambulance Act: This is something I feel very strongly about. I spent a lot of time in the Ornge committee, the special committee struck to deal with Ornge. What we learned was quite compelling, quite dramatic. In Ornge, the Auditor General made it very clear—and let’s just look at what happened. We saw that there was a serious problem. We noticed that there were some red flags. As the opposition, we raised those red flags. What happened was, all of the changes that happened at Ornge, all of the improvements that happened at Ornge: changing the entire board, getting rid of the chief executive officer, the CEO—all of these steps, in terms of improving Ornge, happened without a bill, without any new legislation.", "What does that tell you? We had the tools already. This government had the tools already to actually do the oversight. They had the tools. The Auditor General said very clearly, “They had the tools; they simply didn’t use them.” That’s the problem. You can have legislation, you can strengthen the bill, you can strengthen the oversight mechanism, but at the end of the day you have to actually do something about it. If you’re not using the tools you have, it doesn’t matter how many tools you have—you could have the nicest, fanciest tools, and if you’re not going to build anything with them, you’re not building anything with them. That’s the bottom line. In this case, all of the amendments proposed would not have prevented Ornge—it’s the actions that were required, and the Auditor General makes this absolutely abundantly clear.", "Given how much of a problem Ornge was, given how much of a problem we’ve seen in the health care sector in general and given the fact that that’s our largest expense—health care is our largest expense in terms of provincial expenses. The fact that, right now, as it stands with these amendments to the Ambulance Act, there is still no oversight of Ornge by the Ombudsman. In addition, Ornge is still an organization that can’t be called to the government agencies committee. It still can’t be brought in front of the committee that gives oversight to these arm’s-length agencies that do work for us as a province. It still can’t be done.", "Again, the reason why I question the substance is that, at the end of the day—this is a clear example—this bill doesn’t change the accountability. It doesn’t address the Auditor General’s concerns that it wasn’t the legislation that was needed, it was action needed by this government.", "We had the Meyers Norris Penny report that was released. The report clearly indicated all of the problems that existed with Ornge, yet—" ],

This was the year that the dark body called the Niagara Escarpment Commission intruded into Bob’s life. This was the year that Bob’s use and enjoyment of his private property began to end. This was the year that Bob’s seven-year battle in court began. And 2014 was the year that Bob Mackie died. His heart couldn’t take it any longer. The stress killed him.", "What terrible thing did Bob Mackie do that would make government think it was in the public interest to persecute him in court for seven years? What heinous crime did he commit? Bob’s awful offence against the people, against the crown, against the government that required the full-force infliction of the law in order that justice should be seen to be done was that he dared to operate a small archery training facility on his nine-acre rural property where he lived, near the town of Beamsville. It doesn’t get much worse than that. Thank God for the law.", "Bob loved archery, and he was very good at it. So he set up a shooting range with targets and fake deer, bears and racoons in his nine-acre backyard. He also had two mobile trailers in his backyard for indoor target practice in the winter months or on rainy days. Bob gave archery lessons to schoolchildren, Boy Scouts, members of the Brain Injury Community Re-Entry program, adults; in other words, anyone who enjoyed archery.", "Bob’s archery training facility was the only one in the local community, and he had the full support of the people in his community and of the municipality. Unfortunately, his next-door neighbour decided to lodge a complaint against Bob with the Niagara Escarpment Commission because of noise and traffic. Archery does not make noise and there were never more than five or six cars at Bob’s place at any one time.", "The Niagara Escarpment Commission decided that Bob had committed a crime. The Niagara Escarpment Plan showed that Bob’s nine-acre property was agricultural, and nowhere in the Niagara Escarpment Plan did it say that archery was a permitted use in an agricultural operation. It did not say that archery was not permitted; it just didn’t mention archery at all. The NEC ruled that archery was not permitted on Bob’s land, and therefore he must stop his archery lessons and remove his two mobile trailers. Martin Kilian, planning staff at the Niagara Escarpment Commission, was instrumental in making this decision.", "The order was written that Bob Mackie must end his archery business. Bob decided not to comply with the order. He knew he was doing nothing wrong. He knew he had loyal customers who appreciated his archery training, and he enjoyed teaching archery to his customers.", "Bob hired lawyers and spent seven years in court fighting the Niagara Escarpment Commission. In the last year, his lawyer, Terry Green of Ottawa, was on a winning track with a strategy that looked like it would win in court. Unfortunately, Bob died before he could see that winning day in court. As well, the court case died with Bob.", "Bob was a man of principle who believed in fighting for his rights, and he did that right to the end. Those of us who knew Bob were very proud to call him our friend, and we admired him for his values and strong sense of what is right. Bob was one of the founding members of the Niagara Landowners Association and, for the last year, was president. Bob and the Niagara Landowners Association helped many local people who were victims of government bullies—people like Dave White and Mark Barnfield, who were fighting frivolous, wrongful charges by the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority for doing routine maintenance on their land, such as filling in a shallow puddle to level the soil. Both men were strong, fought for their rights in court and represented themselves. With the help of Bob and the Niagara Landowners Association, they won.", "Jim Williams, an 88-year-old landowner who lived near Beamsville, died on April 19, 2013, of a heart attack brought on by the stress of being harassed and threatened by a Niagara Escarpment Commission enforcement bully named O.J. Macdonald. Enforcer O.J. Macdonald was aggressive and disrespectful of Mr. Williams, who was a war veteran and a long-time resident of Beamsville. The enforcer marched all around Mr. Williams’s private property and told him he couldn’t have his old sawmill on his property; it had been there since 1957. He couldn’t pile lumber on his property; lumber is what you get from a sawmill. He couldn’t bring in a few loads of soil from his neighbour’s place to fill in a few gullies caused by natural erosion, which any responsible landowner would do.", "By the way, his 85-year-old wife, Beth, couldn’t sell dresses from a room in her house. She had had a dress shop in town for 30 years.", "Is that what we mean by law and order? Is that what you would you call good government? I think not. When people are afraid of government, when government starts to hurt good people, when government starts to trample upon people’s private property rights, then government is wrong, and the people need to take back their rights. Thank goodness Bob Mackie and the Niagara Landowners Association were there last year to stand by Jim Williams and support him against the Niagara Escarpment enforcer bully.", "Ken Lucyshyn of Walker Industries told me the story of his 10-year fight with the Niagara Escarpment Commission. Ken spent 10 years and $10 million to expand Walker’s existing quarry. At the end of the process, Walker was forced to go through another hoop, a judicial review at Osgoode Hall, that was brought on by the Niagara Escarpment Commission. The Niagara Escarpment Commission had been infiltrated by special interest groups that wanted to stop the quarry expansion. It cost another million dollars—and we wonder why infrastructure construction costs so much money, we wonder why housing costs so much money and we wonder why small operators are driven out of business. This is not the way government should be operating. Government should be helping businesses that are trying to build our communities. We need the aggregate.", "The Bob Mackie Act will repeal the Niagara Escarpment Planning and Development Act. This means that never again will the Niagara Escarpment Commission be able to prohibit a landowner from practising archery or operating an archery training facility on his private property. This righting of a wrong will be Bob Mackie’s legacy. It is a large step forward towards restoring private property rights in Ontario. It is the beginning of a change that is long overdue. It is the beginning of reversing the tide of creeping socialism that has been slowly taking away our property rights for decades. It is the beginning of restoring the strength and good character that is needed to respect the values of our British Christian cultural heritage of freedom, democracy, common-law and private property rights that date back to the Magna Carta of 1215.", "Our freedom and democracy were hard-fought for in wars and Parliaments over centuries. Freedom can only be assured in a democracy that is founded on the principle of private property rights, where these rights are secured absolutely by law. Bob Mackie’s property rights were denied. We can never let that happen again." ],

It should come as no surprise that the escarpment is well known, not only in my riding but across the country. In fact, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization named it as one of 16 World Biosphere Reserves located in Canada. We only have five others in this country at this time.", "The international community and our federal and provincial communities came together and committed to maintain the Niagara Escarpment and the land in its vicinity. They made sure that this area would stay a natural environment and ensured that development that occurs on this land is compatible with the natural development of the area.", "The bill we’re discussing today would affect the Niagara Escarpment Planning and Development Act, which was passed by the Bill Davis government in June 1973. The bill was designed to protect the escarpment, which is 725 kilometres of land, stretching right up to the tip of the Bruce Peninsula. All of the governments after that continued this plan, until Mike Harris. The commission was almost dismantled under his watch. The budget was cut, and one third of the staff was let go, though the developers did well as they were appointed to the board that was left behind. This board even tried to undo the international protection of the land. A lot of this was undone by Premier Ernie Eves, who replaced a number of the developers on the board.", "Though the Liberals were a bit more supportive, they also contributed to destroying part of the escarpment. It was under their watch that large developers like Highland Companies began to buy up escarpment properties with a plan to turn them into quarries, destroying everything around them and wrecking the land for future generations.", "The Niagara Escarpment commissioners voted to ask the province to end all aggregate extraction on the Niagara Escarpment. But this government hasn’t been responsive in the past, and there’s no reason to believe that they’ll step up and defend the escarpment in the future.", "The bill we’re here to discuss today was originally put forward as Bill 32 and then named after Mr. Bob Mackie. I didn’t know Mr. Mackie personally, but I’ve been told he was a very good man who loved archery. The original intent of Bill 32 was to allow for archery ranges to be put on escarpment land, after a long battle between Mr. Mackie and the Niagara Escarpment Commission. As you can see, there’s a lot of history when it comes to the escarpment.", "What makes this protected land so important? The escarpment is home to forests, farms, recreational areas, some of the best scenic views in all of Canada, wetlands, rolling hills, beautiful waterfalls like Ball’s Falls, mineral resources, wildlife, historic sites, and villages, towns and cities. It’s one of the best-preserved areas of land we have in the entire province, an area that was set aside so our grandchildren and their grandchildren could appreciate the beauty of this great province and this beautiful country. I believe that what the Niagara Escarpment offers to the world is something that benefits us all in this great province. Around 40% of Ontario’s rare flowers are found in the escarpment, along with a number of rare birds and reptiles.", "Many of you here know that it’s home to Canada’s longest and oldest footpath, the Bruce Trail. I’m sure that there are many of my colleagues here who have probably been to the Bruce Trail. I am personally familiar with the trail. Not to date myself here, but I can remember walking the Bruce Trail as a kid—a long, long time ago.", "This is important: When the Bob Mackie Act was originally introduced, it was to allow archery ranges on agricultural land. This is also important. But this bill is completely different from that bill. In fact, this bill makes no sense at all. Instead of allowing for archery ranges on agricultural land in the escarpment, this bill would pave the way for a wholesale destruction of the area. Mr. Mackie was originally proposing that an archery range be allowed to run on his land. An archery range wouldn’t have destroyed the land around his property. Now they’re trying to attach his name to a bill that would replace the forests and the rivers with mega quarries; a bill that would see fragile environments destroyed and replaced by whatever project that developers feel would make the most money.", "This is an area that no developer should get their hands on. There are lots of places in the province of Ontario that developers can develop and make lots of money; this is not one of them. It would be a great mistake if we allowed this to happen in this House.", "There’s nothing in this bill that would protect this wonderful area. Actually reading what’s in this bill—it repeals the Niagara Escarpment Planning and Development Act. Let me say this again: It repeals the entire act, which has protected the escarpment for almost 40 years. For the profits of a few companies, we would destroy one of the province’s most beautiful and historic tracts of land. Why? I say “why” to my colleagues. Why would anybody in Ontario, whether you’re a Liberal, a Conservative or an NDPer, want to support destroying this? It makes no sense to me. All the skiing, the camping, the swimming, the fishing, the boating, the hiking and the preservation would be gone. Gone. The intent is a lot worse than the intent of the original bill.", "I know that in some areas affected by the escarpment, the landowners have had some issues from local conservation authorities. The conservation authorities have had some major problems, and there is definitely room to discuss their business. But at the end of the day, it benefits everyone in Ontario when we have authorities, commissioners, boards and agencies out there protecting our natural environment; when these groups stand up for the land we have done a good job of protecting all these years. The generations before us fought for this land and protected it. We owe it to the generations that follow all of us to make sure that we do the same.", "To be honest, I’m not entirely sure where these changes in the bill come from. Quite frankly, nobody should take this seriously.", "The Liberals shouldn’t be smug about this either. They’ve done very little to protect the escarpment.", "What we do know is that this land contains some of the most beautiful and historic pieces of land not only in this province but the entire country—the entire country. That’s why the international community designated the land the way they did. It benefits our tourist industry when people come from all over the world to see it. It benefits our farmers, who take advantage of the rich soil found on the escarpment. Simply put, right now it benefits the people of Ontario.", "We’ve seen representatives stand up and fight against quarry production in the past. We know that megaquarries will destroy everything past generations have worked so hard to protect. We also know that the damage would be permanent.", "I can’t see any reason why any Liberal, Conservative or NDPer would ever take the escarpment away from our future generations—from our kids and our grandkids. They’re the ones who would be losing out because of this bill. Let’s put this proposal aside and come up with ways we can work together to make sure the escarpment benefits everyone from Ontario and remains an important landmark for generations to come." ],

Indeed, one of the honourees, I’m proud to say, is a former sitting member of this House, the former member of provincial Parliament for Scarborough East, whose work on Save the Rouge Valley System is well and broadly known. That celebration, in light of the topic we’re about to discuss today, strikes me as passing ironic.", "As Ontarians, we enjoy some of the best natural geographic heritage in the world; heritage that must be protected for future generations.", "Bill 32 would repeal the Niagara Escarpment Planning and Development Act, a piece of legislation that is designed to protect the sensitive ecosystems found all along the Niagara Escarpment. The repeal of this act would result in the immediate abolishment of the Niagara Escarpment Commission and the Niagara Escarpment Plan, instruments which protect and maintain the Niagara Escarpment. When this bill was originally tabled in March, it had a much different intention, but it now has grown into something much more.", "Ontario’s Niagara Escarpment is a working countryside and a significant component of Ontario’s greenbelt. I am proud to say it is of cherished value to the citizens in my riding of Burlington and, indeed, in the neighbouring riding of my colleague the member for Halton. It is recognized both provincially and internationally as a significant landform, with a strong system of development control in place to guide development in its area. Land use control is achieved through the Niagara Escarpment Plan, Canada’s first green plan, a visionary land use plan which was conceived in 1973 by the Ontario government, under the leadership of former Premier Bill Davis, through the Niagara Escarpment Planning and Development act.", "The escarpment is also a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve, a designation that in part recognizes land use plans and development controls for areas with unique and sensitive landform characteristics. It is one of only 16 biosphere reserves in Canada and a part of a network of 631 in 19 countries. Little wonder that our Niagara Escarpment is so cherished and so desperately in need of our protection.", "The Niagara Escarpment Plan is an important piece of a broader policy framework that balances the protection of our environment with a responsible approach to planning our communities.", "The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, along with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry—of which I am proud to say I am parliamentary assistant—the Niagara Escarpment Commission and other partner ministries are working together to determine how to coordinate reviews of the Niagara Escarpment Plan, the Oak Ridges moraine plan, the Greenbelt Plan and the official growth plan.", "Our government remains committed to protecting the Niagara Escarpment, and so the province is carefully considering options for the scope and timing of this review, during which we will engage and consult with municipalities, stakeholders and aboriginal communities. I would encourage members of this Legislature and their constituents to participate in these important reviews. I feel that when discussing a topic as important as the Niagara Escarpment, it is vital to understand the history and significance of the area in order to fully appreciate the implications of the decisions we make.", "When the Niagara Escarpment Plan was passed in 1985, it raised the standard for environmental planning in Ontario and Canada as a whole and set an example for the rest of the world.", "The Niagara Escarpment is truly one of Canada’s foremost scenic landforms. The escarpment soars 510 metres at its highest point and stretches 725 kilometres from the beauty of Niagara to Tobermory. Having joined the thousands of Ontarians who have cycled in the Halton Hills and beyond, I can tell you that it is indeed a formidable and majestic climb. It is a rich mosaic of land uses, including farms, recreation areas, forests, cliffs, streams, wetlands, mineral resources and historic sites. Preserving these environmentally sensitive lands in Ontario will be an ongoing challenge, to be sure, but one that is of utmost importance.", "The escarpment also includes the Bruce Trail, Canada’s oldest and longest continuous footpath, reaching from Queenston Heights to Tobermory and going through my riding of Burlington and the riding of my colleague the member for Halton—very important areas, Mr. Speaker, not to be trifled with.", "The area includes some of the province’s best skiing, camping, swimming, fishing, boating and hiking areas, as well as boasting a successful wine industry, all of which contribute to a diverse tourism industry. The Niagara Escarpment contributes an astounding $100 million to local and regional economies through tourism every year.", "Perhaps one of the most important features of the escarpment is the diverse and crucial wildlife habitat that it offers. It contains more than 300 species of birds, 53 mammals, 36 reptiles and amphibians, 90 species of fish and 100 varieties of special-interest flora, including 37 types of wild orchids. Amongst these species are 55 species at risk—canaries in the coal mine. Thirty-two are listed as endangered, 20 as threatened and three of special concern. This only goes to underline the importance of the Niagara Escarpment and ensuring that it is protected.", "The area also includes many agricultural operations, which will become even more important as we deal with the effects of climate change, a rapidly growing population, expanding urban areas and increasing demands. Food security and the livelihood of our agri-food industry is an ever-growing concern and we need to take it seriously.", "Repealing the Niagara Escarpment Planning and Development Act would open up the entire area to potential development. This could put even more pressure on species at risk that are already having a tough-enough time trying to survive. Valuable farmland could be lost, forcing us to rely more heavily on food imports.", "This area needs special protections, and right now it has that. To do away with all of that would not simply be the wrong decision; it would be irresponsible. Ultimately, it is our responsibility as legislators to preserve this province and everything that it has to offer for future generations, and Bill 32 does just the opposite." ],

Because of its unique geological feature, as other members have mentioned, the NE was designated as a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve. To put this in perspective, there are only 16 other UNESCO World Biosphere Reserves across Canada. This prestigious designation gives an area international recognition for the important ecological and/or cultural values in the area. Here, in this Legislature, we should feel honoured to have such an important geological feature in Ontario. We also, by extension, have a responsibility to protect it.", "To put it in perspective, other UNESCO World Biosphere Reserves include Yellowstone National Park, which was the first national park in the world and one of the first biosphere reserves. Another example is Everglades National Park in Florida, which is the largest designated subtropical wilderness reserve in North America and is home to one of the most diverse and complex ecosystems in the world. Another famous UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve is the Galapagos Islands, which are best known for their population of giant tortoises, and are of course where Charles Darwin formulated his theory of evolution. The Niagara Escarpment is part of this very exclusive club.", "I agree that there are some challenges with the current NEC, and certainly there are areas within the permitting process within the NEC that need to be clarified and updated, but we should not be repealing the NEC, as it was created to preserve and cherish this unique landscape. Can we improve transparency and ensure proper oversight? Absolutely. Can the NEC planning and approval process be improved through clearer direction on the roles and responsibilities of the NEC and their board members? Absolutely. But does this mean throwing out the entire concept behind the NEC? No. That is why I cannot support this bill in its current form." ],

The Niagara Escarpment Commission is a legacy of Premier William Davis and Mr. Norm Sterling, who was in the cabinet at that time, responsible for the development of this plan.", "This has had multi-partisan support over the years— almost unanimous support. It has gone through several Premiers. Some you wouldn’t even expect to be supportive of the Niagara Escarpment Commission have been. I have been a strong supporter of it—of the preservation of agricultural land, of the preservation of environmental and natural resources that we need in this province.", "One of my colleagues who was in the Niagara Peninsula recently said he looked up and saw the Niagara Escarpment and how beautiful it looked. There are many people out there who would love to see hotels on it, skiing resorts on it, commercial developments on it and residential developments on it.", "This is a real gem. It’s a biosphere reserve. It’s something we in this generation have an obligation to maintain for future generations in this province.", "There has been support from all political parties. I think of David Tilson, who was a predecessor to the member, who was here at that time—a very strong supporter. Premier Peterson, Premier Rae and Ruth Grier, who is in the gallery here today, all have been very strong supporters of it.", "One of the problems that we have happening in many jurisdictions is a loss of land. Once it’s gone, it’s gone forever. I think it was Will Rogers who one time said, “They’re not making it anymore.”", "I look at the Niagara Peninsula, for instance, which used to be a place—a gem—for tender-fruit farming. Today we have development all over it—a big mistake for future generations.", "The amount of arable land that there is left in Canada, and in the province of Ontario, is very limited. I know we think our province looks big and our country looks big, but the land where you have climatic conditions and soil conditions where you can actually grow agricultural products is very limited. We do not want to be reliant upon others.", "So I pay tribute to those who previously established this, with the support of everyone—established the Niagara Escarpment Commission. Mr. Sterling was very passionate about this when he came to this House and when he was part of the Davis cabinet. Premier Davis has received accolades from many people over the years for having this plan come forward. As I say, subsequent to that, Premier Peterson was supportive; Premier Rae was supportive; Premier Harris was supportive. I’ve got to confess to you that I thought, when Premier Harris’s government came in, we might see some substantial changes taking place. They avoided that, and for that I commend them. I think of John Snobelen, for instance, who was a minister at that time and did not make the kind of changes that some people in the province were advocating at that time.", "If you go into Pennsylvania or New York state—we always think they’re states with a lot of population and so on and that it’s going to be wall-to-wall development. Go through Pennsylvania, go down some of the highways in Pennsylvania and you will see large tracts of rural land—beautiful landscape. If you start to erode that, if you take it away, if you give it to local people—there are a lot of people at the local level who will not be satisfied until they’ve paved every last square centimetre of property. Then they will say they’ve reached paradise. Well, I think the overwhelming majority of people in this House do not believe that, and I want to commend those who in years gone by have been protectors—first of all, establishing the Niagara Escarpment Commission and then protectors of it.", "The world looks upon this as being a major gem that we have. It’s something that when you lose it, you cannot get it back. When you allow the development to take place where it’s appropriate, what happens is that you can’t pull those buildings out. You can’t get the bulldozers back, pushing the soil back in and restoring it. It’s very, very difficult to do that. So I will certainly be in opposition to this resolution.", "I should say, by the way, when I was first elected to this House, one of my colleagues from Grey county put forward a similar motion to this House. I don’t even know if it was alone, but I stood against that resolution at that time, against the resolution that would have abolished the Niagara Escarpment Commission, because I think it’s exceedingly important.", "Are there changes that have to be made from time to time? Yes. Is there a review of its mandate? Yes. But this is something we should preserve, and I implore all members of this House to unanimously reject this particular proposal." ],

Canada is supposedly a free country, yet over the last several decades we have watched as governments at all levels have slowly but steadily eroded our common-law rights and freedoms.", "Of course, one of the key foundations of the success of western developed nations is private property rights. The ability to buy and use land is what lures immigrants from around the world to settle here. It is the Canadian dream to buy and own a single-family dwelling to raise your family, yet since the 1970s, social engineers have seized the planning process and used it to control and restrict land, land use and availability.", "This is a province where 87% of all our land is crown land, yet the provincial government has been crowding us into high-density development using a variety of excuses. First it was to house the poor, then it was to house young urban professionals, and now the excuse is to save the environment.", "Currently, people seem to have lost the basic common understanding of the importance of private property rights to maintaining freedom, creating prosperity, and protecting the environment. Many people seem to think that the private property owners, without rigorous government oversight, will intentionally destroy their property and the environment. Nothing could be further from the truth. The vast majority of private property owners go to great lengths to care for and improve their property.", "That is what Bob Mackie did. He invested in his property to enhance the environment and his customers’ experience. For that high crime, he was persecuted through the courts for seven long years, a persecution that eventually cost his life.", "So today, not only do I advocate for the repeal of the Niagara Escarpment Planning and Development Act, but also for authority delegated to agencies, boards and commissions to be repatriated back to the provincial government so that elected representatives can be held accountable for their decisions. It is unconscionable for elected representatives to wash their hands of the actual job of governing. If the provincial government wants to meddle in local planning and politics, they need to do the work themselves, not pass the buck.

Ask them if the government should decide what food and how much of it they should be allowed to eat. Ask them if they want to maintain their common-law rights and freedoms or be impoverished by an out-of-touch centralized government. I suggest that the vast majority of school kids don’t want to be continuously bullied by intrusive controlling government for the rest of their lives.", "What we do today will have grave consequences for future generations.

We can’t all throw a discus 67 metres or score 8,000 points in the decathlon. But we can all devote ourselves to goals and follow the example of these athletes striving for perfection.", "That perfection is something we will all get to experience and see next summer.

No matter where you live in Ontario, no matter what your age, no matter where you come from, we will all cheer together with one voice. We will gather in living rooms, pubs and stadiums around the province to cheer on our athletes and celebrate our Ontario. After the roar in the stadiums, at the velodrome and around the swimming pools dies down, the sound of the Pan Am Games will echo on long after in our hearts and in our minds.", "These games are what Ontario is all about. They celebrate the different cultures, different peoples and different abilities throughout the two Americas, all welcomed here into our extraordinarily open and accepting community—our Ontario. We will be cheering on our Ontario athletes and our other Canadian athletes, but we will be supporting and encouraging all the athletes who come here to strive for excellence.

And it was inspiring to see several world-class athletes in attendance, including Olympic cyclist Curt Harnett, the great Canadian and Ontarian cyclist who emceed the event.", "After speaking with residents, meeting with organizers and listening to our athletes, it’s clear that the level of excitement and enthusiasm for these games is only continuing to grow.", "The public’s response to these games has been incredible. Within the first 48 hours of going on sale, 75,000 tickets were requested.", "So far, we have had more than 33,000 people sign up as volunteers. This is all the evidence we need of a community coming together. These people are virtually getting a free passport to possibly the best seats in the house.

The size of these games is staggering: more than 7,000 world-class athletes representing 41 countries and territories competing in 51 different sports and hundreds of individual events. The events will be spread throughout 40 different venues across the province, spanning 5,300 square kilometres and 15 host municipalities, including my own. Think about it: The games will showcase Ontario to an international audience, and I know that we will be ready for our moment on the international stage.", "These Pan Am and Parapan Am Games are not only a celebration of human excellence and peaceful international competition; they are also about bringing together athletes, spectators, volunteers, organizers and local communities in the pursuit of excellence, friendship and respect. These games will also provide significant and lasting economic benefits to our province.", "The games will attract tourists, create jobs and help to leverage new business investments. They are expected to grow Ontario’s GDP by $3.7 billion, attract up to a quarter of a million visitors, and create 26,000 new jobs. This will be an incredible boost to our economy. There’s no question that these games will be an economic driver for our province.", "In addition, there will be massive improvements to provincial infrastructure. The construction of new, world-class athletic facilities will ensure that athletes, spectators and Ontarians will reap the long-term benefits that come with hosting such a major international event. These games will transform communities, and that transformation will happen all across the province.", "In fact, my riding of Halton is in the midst of such a transformation. Halton has been selected to host the Pan Am and Parapan Am track cycling events. These events will be taking place in a brand new, state-of-the-art velodrome. Once finished, it will be the only facility of its kind in Canada and just the second in North America. It meets top international standards, giving our Canadian athletes a world-class venue where they can come to train and compete at the highest levels. This will be a great legacy piece, not just for the town of Milton but for Halton, Ontario and Canada as well. Having a world-class venue right in our own backyard in Halton gives our athletes the opportunity to train in Ontario, compete in Ontario and excel in Ontario and the world.", "Perhaps the best part about the new velodrome is that it won’t be just for top-level athletes. In addition to track cycling, the velodrome will be a central hub of physical activity for our local community, a place that will help to bring people closer together and encourage a more active lifestyle for local residents, regardless of age, fitness or ability. It will be open year-round and will house multi-purpose facilities to accommodate a variety of fitness activities, including basketball, volleyball, badminton and running. There will be a new fitness centre and studio space, and there will be areas that can be used to host community events and special gatherings.", "It won’t just be great for our community fitness and spirit; it will be great for Halton’s economy as well. It will help businesses to explore new revenue streams, connect with a larger, more diverse customer base and share in the long-term economic benefits of improved development prospects.", "When you think about it, it’s really quite remarkable what we’ll be getting out of this investment individually, socially and economically. The velodrome is but one example of Ontario’s promotion, celebration and legacy strategy, a $40-million provincial investment, spread over three years, that will be aimed at making sure all Ontarians—not just those living within the games’ footprint—will feel a positive impact.", "As part of the strategy, the government will be looking to expand our trail network, provide OSAP support for student volunteers, create community-based programs to promote healthy living and leadership, and support the 2015 Pan American Economic Summit to promote trade, investment and business opportunities. It is a plan that aligns with existing provincial programs and it is an excellent way for us to leverage and maximize the benefits from hosting the games.", "Getting ready to host the Pan Am and Parapan Games has been a labour of love for all of those involved. It has taken a lot of hard work to get here. Five years of careful planning and preparation have gone into making sure that next summer will be a time that athletes and spectators can enjoy and that the people of Ontario can be proud of. These games are important for our province, for our athletes and for our economy. We will experience the highs and lows of our athletes’ performances, but we will know clearly during that brief period in time that we are one Ontario. We are the best province in the best country in the world. This will be our moment. It will be a brief moment in time, but for many of us, it will result in memories that will last a lifetime and leave a legacy for Ontarians to enjoy for generations to come.", "So I call on this Legislature to commemorate this momentous occasion and support this motion to declare July and August of next year to be Pan Am and Parapan Months here in Ontario." ],

I am from Montreal, and I have a feeling that Montreal is still paying for the Olympics, believe it or not. To this day, they still haven’t finished paying for it. It was also supposed to be infrastructure that the city would be left to enjoy. Well, I think that the city was certainly left with a lot of infrastructure, and I don’t know how much enjoyment has been gotten out of it in terms of the costs associated with not just building—we have to maintain this kind of infrastructure, so I think that has to be budgeted in as well, and I hope that is in part of the budget; that the municipalities aren’t going to be coming and crying to the province later on and asking for funding to maintain the structures that we’re building for these games. We need to ensure that the model is in place.", "The Pan Am and Parapan Am Games will collectively give us a chance to proudly celebrate our city and to revel in its diversity. Events such as the Toronto International Film Festival, the Caribbean carnival and World Pride offer us reminders of the city’s joys and I think really put Toronto on the map, and I hope the Pan Am Games will as well.", "Given the long-term benefits our province will see, I think it’s very important that we make sure that these games are a success. The planning for the games—I hate to use the word “scandal,” because it’s getting to the point where when we say the word “scandal” so many times, it actually loses its meaning, and I’m concerned with that. There are articles just today in the media saying that politicians are considered one of the least-trusted professions in the world." ],

The athletes’ village—I think we all wanted to be there joining in all the fun, and I hope that the roadwork we need to keep these games a success is being looked into.", "Right now, Toronto is being choked with gridlock—I don’t have to remind everybody of that—and the decision to have the Pan Am Games across 13 municipalities, in my estimation, was somewhat naive, because in order to have it across 13 municipalities, we have to have a way to get all the judges, all the staffing, all the security and all the visitors between these events and municipalities.", "We have to be able to feed people, we have to be able to house people, and we have to be able to move people. Toronto can certainly manage. We have enough hotels. I believe we have enough restaurants. But I’m very concerned about the transit, I’m very concerned about the traffic, and I’m also very concerned about the parking issues. I’m hoping that that’s going to be addressed, and that we’re not going to be coming to the people of Toronto two weeks before the games and saying, “You know what? We’re not going to be able to do it without your co-operation. You’re all going to have to go on vacation while we’re hosting these games or stay home and stay off the streets, because we’re not going to be able to have business functioning in Toronto.” We’re not going to be able to have the residents of Toronto going about their daily lives with all the extra traffic and transit users. We can have subways, but if the subway cars are full of our Toronto residents, which so often we see that people tell us—I’m sure that other members here hear the same thing from their constituents: The train comes and they cannot get on the train; the streetcar comes and they cannot get on that streetcar.", "It will be summer, and I think that unfortunately a lot of Torontonians and people from the greater Toronto area and Hamilton will choose to be away because they will be concerned.

Maybe that’s something that we have to look at, to say to the cab companies, “You know what? You’re going to have so much business, more than usual. Can we have a special Pan Am rate for taxi service?” Maybe that’s something that the planners can look at as well.", "Of the $1.4-billion operating budget for these games—that doesn’t really include transportation and it certainly doesn’t include security costs—almost half is earmarked for capital investment, and a lot of it is in high-performance sport venues. We need to ensure that there is funding for our athletes to train; not just to have these venues, but we need to invest in coaching for all of our athletes. Otherwise, this really won’t be a great investment in terms of our sports community.", "The area’s athletic community has been woefully underserved in a lot of ways. I think we saw a big investment in our athletes before the last two Olympics, but I hope that with the Pan Am and Parapan Am Games, we can find the necessary funding, either through different government programs or through private sponsorship of some kind, because it’s great to have the venues, but if we don’t have the funding to coach our athletes, it really is in vain.", "I want to mention that the security costs are ballooning. I’ve been to some of the committee meetings, and again, part of it is because it’s across 13 municipalities. I’m wondering where the funding is going to be coming from, because what we saw in the last couple of weeks in our capital of Ottawa is that security costs are of great concern. I’m concerned that somebody might use the Pan Am Games and the world stage that it’s on to make political statements through violence. I would like to see that we’re investigating that through social media programs, perhaps asking people to be alert—and what they should be alert for, because it’s not something that we can rely on just our police and security forces to do. We have to also do our part.", "Let’s celebrate. I look forward to celebrating with everybody here and everybody at home. We need to celebrate Pan Am as an opportunity to promote sports and camaraderie within our city, our province and our country.

In the first Pan Am Games in Hamilton in the 1930s, my aunt was a world-class swimmer. She then went on to train for the Berlin Olympics. For 29 years after she completed that, she taught many budding Olympic swimmers in the 200-metre and 100-metre breaststroke for Canada. I also had family members who were involved in other sports during the first Pan Am Games—which I might add was in Hamilton, Ontario—called the British Empire Games.", "I’d like to also say that my colleague across the floor, the MPP from Halton, did a wonderful job in her speech on promotion and sales, which is also part of the whole Pan Am procedure. That certainly is something that has to be promoted, and hopefully her venue will be ready soon for use. That’s if some of the other venues are finished on time.", "Of course, I’ve stood up here many times and had concerns about the Pan Am stadium in Hamilton. I’ve been saying for months—these concerns that I’ve raised with the minister responsible for the Pan/Parapan Am Games for some months now; he has stood up and kind of done a good sales job. It’s his job do that, and he’s certainly avoided my questions about finance and kind of deflected and said that I should be honoured that I have this stadium in Hamilton, and I should be honoured, and we should all be honoured that these venues are coming to the province. No doubt about it: We’re excited about the after-use of the venues, if they’re used in a proper sense.", "However, let’s talk about the cost.

These are the types of things—the legacy, as the member from Halton likes to talk about: Some of the buildings that they used in 1976 Olympics are now rundown, derelict buildings down by the waterfront in Montreal that are being used for nothing. I remember one of them, in particular, they wanted to turn into a residential area after the athletes finished; it was called Habitat. Habitat is now a rundown, weed-filled building. These are concerns that are serious.", "The minister went out of his way yesterday to take my concerns to a personal level, unfortunately, by saying that I did not attend the briefings. I’d like to set the record straight today. My staff, my EA from Queen’s Park and our researcher, attended two of those briefings because I was—sorry, Minister—at a funeral, and I was out of town for those two things. Thanks for bringing that up. The first did include the previous minister but was chaired by his deputy; he wasn’t at the first one. It was for the media. The EA and researcher both attended and said to me that it was more of a sales pitch, more of a rah-rah than actual numbers and finances about the cost of security. It started off at $138 million; now we’re at $238 million, and they still haven’t signed the final deals, as the minister said the other day. He said they did, but they haven’t signed the deals with the regional police departments, which is going to raise the internal costs and raise the external cost even more.", "For them to stand up here week after week and chastise opposition members for their concerns—doing their job: protecting the buck for the taxpayer—is really unfair of them to do because they don’t know the final numbers. The minister even told me he doesn’t know the final cost of security. That’s a fair thing to say, but the bottom line is, don’t stand up here day in, day out, week after week, saying everything is hunky-dory, everything is on budget, everything is going to be great, we should be thankful, we’re just being negative and all that.", "I’ll tell you what, Speaker. You heard it here first: I’ll be glad when it’s all over and all the numbers finally come in. I think the tune might change a little bit over there. I’ll be there to watch and I’ll be there to evaluate, and I’ll certainly pass it on to our fair minister and his friends if he doesn’t come in under budget, like he said, and on time.", "Moving on: The venue was difficult, to say the least. It took about 30 minutes for my EA, an ISU staff person at Queen’s Park—they reported that they got all the details within 30 minutes, and when they got there, it sounded like an old TTC service barn. It was difficult to hear. We didn’t pick up half the thing because we were sitting way at the back and they had all their staff at the front.

We certainly need to celebrate the athletes. That’s what we should all be doing here. There’s been some overshadowing on this topic by the government’s poor management of the games, whether it’s expense scandals, construction delays, golden parachutes or executives who failed to bring budgets in on time. Maybe they should have consulted the former mayor of Winnipeg, who is now the Minister of the Environment. You hosted the games in Winnipeg in, I think, 1999, did you not, for a cost of only $150 million? Well done. I think that maybe there should be some consultation with the minister who exists now.", "But really, we want to see them succeed. They’re coming.

I was mayor and played a major role the last time, so I know first-hand how hard it is for a city to secure these games.", "One of the things that’s really interesting to us is that we had 60 years when Vancouver got the Olympics and Calgary got the Olympics and Montreal got the Olympics and Victoria got the Commonwealth Games and Winnipeg got the Pan Am Games twice, in 1967 and in 1999. When I was mayor, we used to tease Toronto and Hamilton about never having really had a major event in our lifetime.

I’m starting to understand why previous governments couldn’t do it, because they’re like the member from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek. They can tell you everything that could possibly go wrong and paralyze themselves. They never did it. It’s because, when the parties opposite had their shot, they were terrified. They’re the most risk-averse. We’re excited, Mr. Speaker. We know this is going to be amazing.", "The reason that the Winnipeg games were so inexpensive was because we held them before. We didn’t have to build anything and we didn’t have the Parapan Am Games. Everything was built. The athletes’ facilities were built; the pools were built; all of that was built. We renewed them all.", "The other thing I love: I was mayor of the poorest of the large cities in Canada. We had the highest debt and the highest property taxes when I got elected. When I left, we had the lowest debt and the second-lowest property taxes. So I can tell you first-hand: Pan Am Games are good for building your tax base and helping governments.", "There’s a reason I ran for the Liberals and not the Conservatives or the NDP: because that philosophy of prudence without being afraid to take a risk is found in this party, not in the parties opposite.", "We are delivering a games, but these aren’t like the Winnipeg or—these are like the Rio games. Rio then went on to get the Olympics and ran the most successful games. This is Ontario’s introduction to the world of international competitive athletics which previous governments had delivered in the last century. Every other major region of Canada entered the international sporting scene in the 20th century. We had to wait until the 21st century. Thank God we finally elected a bright, creative, risk-embracing, innovative Liberal government that, for the first time, is delivering what are going to be the most amazing games.", "I’m going to keep all the tapes from all of the whiners and lemon-suckers opposite so that when the games are booming—let’s just remember who took the risk and showed the leadership and who hid in the shadows and whined and told us, “It’s all going to be so terrible.

He used to say, well, if they were told they had pancreatic cancer, then the prognosis is quite serious; that 99% of the time it’s terminal and the other 1% was a misdiagnosis. It’s a very serious cancer.", "I think it says something about human nature in general that, until we raise awareness of something by having a special month, maybe a hashtag on Twitter or a special day to focus on and raise awareness, oftentimes, unless people have a close friend or family member who is affected, they aren’t aware of a certain type of disease.", "We saw this just recently with ALS, when they had the bucket challenge.

That’s a testament to what a deadly type of cancer it is.", "One of the reasons pancreatic cancer has such a poor prognosis is that it’s very difficult to have early detection. They are making advances in terms of early detection. That’s why I think it is a good idea to raise awareness now.", "It really is one of those sort of symptomless diseases that masks as something else entirely, and by the time they figure out what it is—it’s often by process of elimination. They’re able to prove that it isn’t one medical condition, it isn’t a second medical condition, and it isn’t a third. Then finally—finally—they decide that they have to go in and take a look at the pancreas. Because it’s such an internal organ, it’s not something that’s easy to look at.", "Most people, as I said and the member said so well, aren’t aware of what pancreatic cancer is until they know somebody with the disease. I think that that’s something that we all have to work on, to raise awareness so that we can have people advocate, even on their own behalf, and suggest that they might suspect that it’s something more serious than what their doctor is suggesting and they want further testing. I’m hoping that, with awareness of pancreatic cancer, people will understand some of the signs and symptoms.", "All of the great medical care that we have in the province of Ontario—you can build hospitals, but if we don’t have them staffed and we don’t have the proper equipment, that’s not providing health care. If we’re closing departments, as was discussed earlier today, in Leamington, that the obstetrics gynecology department was closing—well, it’s not just about having babies, obstetrics and gynecology; it’s women’s health. If women have children to take care of, and they’re told that they need to go for a follow-up appointment, and it’s hours of a drive away, they’re far less likely to go.", "We can’t just look at the costs. We have to look at the lives that are at stake and have health care access close to home. It’s a balancing act, and we all know that. We all know that we would like to have a hospital in every neighbourhood with every department and every type of machine. We know that there are limitations to the closeness that we can provide for health care, but we do have to make it accessible in the province, and we do have to provide the services. There are many challenges—we all know that—in terms of different cultures and different languages and in terms of budgetary constraints.", "But we have to realize that the funds that we’re collecting, as nice as it was—we just spoke about the Parapan Am games. We like to apply the tax revenue to these fun events, but we have to first find ways to fund the health care of our aging population and our youth as well. We have to find the wherewithal within all of us to focus the health care dollars where they’re supposed to go, into front-line health care; not creating bureaucracies, not creating other layers of government, which is what the LHINs and the CCACs are. These are all administrative levels, and they eat up a lot of the funding for health care. We need to focus that funding on health care as much as we can.", "I’m glad that we’re talking about pancreatic cancer and raising awareness of pancreatic cancer, but I think that we also have to always remember that there are many other diseases that we need to raise awareness of as well. We see in the Legislature that very often stakeholders come and visit us. They’ll do things like giving us pins to recognize what they’re trying to raise awareness of. We had just yesterday ME, myalgic encephalomyelitis; they came to visit to raise awareness of people with very debilitating problems.

I’m sure that each of us in this chamber has been touched personally in some way by this disease, whether it’s a personal struggle or that of a loved one, a friend or a co-worker. Many times the forms of cancers that have touched our lives are generally known. That is to say, they are types that we have heard about before and have been involved with in some way, perhaps through fundraising.", "What is alarming about pancreatic cancer is the relative mystery about the disease. Despite being the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related death in Canada and the United States and having the highest mortality rate of all major cancers, awareness of pancreatic cancer is exceptionally low compared to other forms of cancer.", "In November 2012, Pancreatic Cancer Canada commissioned an Ipsos Reid poll that surveyed over 1,000 Canadians to determine their knowledge and awareness of the disease. The poll found that only one third of Canadians are knowledgeable about pancreatic cancer, and that we tend to vastly overestimate its survival rate.", "Other facts that are important to note: There are no detection tools to diagnose this disease in its early stages, when surgical removal of the tumour is still possible. Because there are often no early symptoms, it is also very difficult to detect the cancer early. Pancreatic cancer can often grow for months before discovery and diagnosis, and diagnosis is often only made once symptoms become apparent, such as weight loss, back pain and jaundice.", "The cancer also spreads rapidly and, unfortunately for most cases—in fact, over 50% of the time—pancreatic cancer tumours are only found after they have metastasized to other organs, giving an average survival rate after diagnosis of only three to six months and earning this form of cancer the title of “silent killer.” Pancreatic cancer is the only one of the top 10 cancer killers that has a five-year survival rate still in the single digits; that is, 6%.", "The results of these findings are significant. As Canadians, we aren’t knowledgeable about the disease, and we do not know how silent and deadly it can be. It kills nearly as many people per year as breast cancer. What’s worse is the fact that, without increased knowledge and public attention given to this disease, we have little hope to increase funding for medical research. That, really, is why raising awareness of this silent killer is so important.", "An unfortunate thing for all of us with this disease is that it takes away people who bring us so much joy. It was a few years ago when the town of Dryden said goodbye to a beloved jazzman, Craig Fotheringham. His whole life was filled with music, and he brought that pleasure to everyone around him. As a youth, Craig played piano under the instruction of his mother and piano teacher. As a teenager, he enjoyed success in the local group Shades of Blue during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Over the years of his musical career, he became a celebrated musician. His loss has left an undeniable void in the country, blues, rock and jazz scenes. This formidable musician passed away at the age of 58, following a battle with pancreatic cancer.", "Pancreatic Cancer Canada has done a good job in terms of raising awareness throughout the year by remembering those who have lost their lives to the disease, supporting those who have been diagnosed and are battling the disease, and providing hope for future generations that a cure may be found, by featuring two campaigns. In the spring, the organization sells pansies, which symbolize hope for all those who are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In November, the organization features its Purple Lights Campaign, which seeks to shine some light on this terrible disease. This campaign has two particular components: Individuals can participate by displaying strings of purple lights on their homes, and businesses and governments can participate by illuminating their buildings using large purple spotlights during the month of November. Some of the buildings that have participated in Ontario include the CN Tower—Niagara Falls, Toronto’s city hall and the Niagara Falls Skylon, among others.", "But as with all cancers, more needs to be done. As mentioned, public awareness is still very low. It is believed that one of the main reasons for this general lack of public awareness about pancreatic cancer has to do with the fact that there seems to be a relatively small proportion of the Canadian population who personally know somebody who has been diagnosed with this disease.", "Only about 6% of the Canadian population personally knows someone, such as a family member, neighbour, co-worker or friend, who has survived pancreatic cancer. This figure serves in stark contrast to the personal knowledge of survivors of other forms of cancer, such as breast cancer—60% of Canadians know someone who has been personally affected—and prostate cancer, where 43% of Canadians know somebody personally affected by the disease, to name a couple of forms.", "This fact likely speaks to the high mortality rate of pancreatic cancer. In fact, it may surprise some people in this House that the following celebrities have passed away due to this tragic disease: Steve Jobs, who was a businessperson, entrepreneur and inventor; Bill Hicks, who was a social critic, comedian and musician; Patrick Swayze, singer-songwriter, actor and dancer; Jack Benny, comedian and actor; Luciano Pavarotti, opera singer and actor; Joan Crawford, pin-up girl, actor and singer; Sally Ride, a physicist and astronaut; Donna Reed, an actor; Marcello Mastro—" ],

This speaks, first of all, to the challenge with regard to pancreatic cancer.", "Speaker, with your permission, perhaps I can use this moment to just talk as a doctor.", "Unfortunately, we do tend to see it late. Patients tend to experience what we call the B symptoms, which, unfortunately, are kind of general and could have resulted from many things.", "The first, of course, is weight loss. People look cachectic, as we call it, meaning they look somewhat sick, malnourished, maybe a little bit off-colour. They may have fatigue; they may have fevers; they may have unexplained aches and pains.", "It’s only after many, many, many things are tested for, thought about, eliminated—you know, is it a flu, is it a virus, is it this, is it that, is it a medication change, is it a stressful job, whatever—it is only then that sometimes folks may trigger or may realize that there’s a deeper process going on. By the time the patient experiences these symptoms, say, for months or perhaps even longer, and by the time it declares itself more overtly with things like unremitting, severe, almost untreatable back pain or jaundice—meaning, turning yellow, because it affects the liver and there’s leakage of liver fluids—that, unfortunately, is often very, very late.", "I would just encourage folks to learn about some of what we call the B symptoms. If things are lingering, if it’s not just off-colour on the weekend but progressing, lingering, unexplained weight loss, they should probably be analyzed.", "The other thing I would say, is just a shout-out to some of my Etobicoke colleagues, including the honourable Mayor Rob Ford who, as you know, is battling a different form of cancer, not pancreatic but what’s called liposarcoma; it’s basically fat cells gone crazy. This, by the way, is a cousin of the type of cancer that took out Terry Fox, who had a bone-related cancer, osteosarcoma.", "All of this means simply to say that, unfortunately, cancer, as a disease entity, is still alive, it’s still progressing, it’s still spreading, it’s still increasing in prevalence; and all of us should collectively, for the health of Ontarians, and particularly the fortification of our health care system, mobilize all our different modalities, whether it’s awareness or supporting my honourable colleague from Ajax–Pickering on this particular day calling attention to World Pancreatic Cancer Day—and also for the members of the public to be aware of the different forms of cancer long, long before they actually declare themselves as, for example, being either inoperable or too large, or having spread, metastasized or left home.", "I salute my colleague from Ajax–Pickering. I know that we’ll be hearing from some of my other colleagues, including the honourable Monte Kwinter, who will speak more directly to this." ],

In doing so, we will join organizations and individuals around the world to mark the first-ever World Pancreatic Cancer Day.", "Why the need for the day and the need for awareness, Speaker? The fact is that, as we’ve heard, pancreatic cancer has one of the lowest survival rates of any cancer. This has been the case for more than 40 years, and yet very few are aware of its impact. It’s a fact, of course, not lost on me, as my extended family is one that has felt that impact directly. Somebody close to me, my grandfather Lloyd Harris, passed away in 1991 of pancreatic cancer.", "I’m often asked about how I got into politics, if my family was involved, and I always say my immediate family wasn’t but the one individual who had the political bug was, in fact, my grandfather. I remember, as a little kid, joining him as he was active in the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. He was a township councillor for Egremont township. I really remember those days fondly. But I do, unfortunately, remember those days when he was dealing with pancreatic cancer and the treatment of that. It was truly a painful sight to see him go through.", "Of course, technology and medical advances today are progressing, but as we heard earlier, Steve Jobs, someone who perhaps would have had all the resources at his disposal, unfortunately succumbed to the same thing that my grandfather did. I want to mention that because I do believe it’s important, and there is a family connection to that.", "World Pancreatic Cancer Day, of course, will help to bring about the much-needed change in awareness levels about the disease and a focus on the need for urgent change. I’m proud to support today’s motion to ensure that we in Ontario are part of that much-needed change. With our support, we can move forward to not only raise awareness of pancreatic cancer but also to support innovative research into early detection methods and improved treatment options, and to save lives.", "Ultimately, the hope is that the discovery of a screening test will enable doctors to diagnose this disease in its early stage when it is most treatable, resulting in a significant increase in survival rates. As we work toward that goal, I note, as well, that the launch of World Pancreatic Cancer Day this year will also incorporate the launch of a website and a social media campaign. I encourage fellow members to get tweeting on the 13th.", "In fact, you can actually get involved today by joining the World Pancreatic Cancer Day Thunderclap, blasting out a message across social media about the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer.", "Again, I thank the member for bringing this forward and pledge my support for the motion to recognize November 13 as World Pancreatic Cancer Day here in Ontario.

Every one of us has had—someone has touched our lives with the disease of cancer.", "Very little is known about pancreatic cancer; it’s not something that I hear a lot about. So I did a little bit of reading up on it. They call it the silent disease. Often in its early stages, you don’t have the symptoms to know that there’s something you need to investigate further. So, definitely, having an awareness piece, making sure that people realize that pancreatic cancer is something that you can be exposed to and you should be dealing with the screening—I think prevention in medicine, in our health care system, is one of the best ways that we can get ahead of disease and make sure that we stay healthy. If we don’t have that prevention piece, then unfortunately the outcomes of these diseases are not very successful.", "Some of the symptoms that people will experience are jaundice—we should be letting people know some of the things to watch for; jaundice is one. Also, abdominal pain and back pain; people might think that they’ve pulled a muscle. Be careful; that could mean something different than what you’re experiencing. Onset of diabetes—that’s also something that’s very important.", "We have to take responsibility for our own bodies and know when changes happen so that we can—we don’t want to self-diagnose, because that’s not a good thing. But once we see that there’s something wrong, that we’re not feeling the same way, we’re tired, we’re depressed—because those are other symptoms that happen, and weakness—those kinds of things are flags. As we talk about pancreatic cancer and we bring it to people’s attention—those are great ways of making sure that people go out and get diagnosed or get tested or go to their doctor to make sure that they prevent any further seriousness of this type of cancer disease.", "I commend the member for bringing it forward and, again, making it something that people should be cognizant of. Our health is very important to every one of us. When we experience symptoms, we should go to a doctor to make sure that we can catch them early and have good survival rates with any kind of cancer." ],

He was really concerned about it, so he went to see his doctor.", "The doctor looked at him and said, “I have to do some tests.” Then he said, “You’ve got pancreatic cancer.”", "My brother said to him, “What does that mean?”", "He said, “Well, the mortality rate is about 99%. The only people who really survive it are people who are diagnosed by accident. Ronnie Hawkins is one of them. He was diagnosed by accident and he’s still around.”", "Anyway, my brother—they started to give him treatment, and then they determined that he might be a candidate for what is known as a Whipple operation. It’s a technique that is done very rarely in Canada because people just don’t have the expertise to do it, but down in Florida, in Miami, there’s a major hospital that does it quite regularly. They had to determine whether or not he was a candidate, and they decided, “Yes, you are a candidate, and we’re going to prescribe it.”", "So I flew down to Florida. I went to the hospital to visit him. He seemed to be quite comfortable. The surgeon came in and talked to him and said, “Well, you are a candidate, and we’ve had some positive results from this. We’re going to go ahead.”", "The next thing that I knew, they took him into the operating room. I was waiting in there, expecting that I was going to be there for some time. About 20 minutes later, I saw the surgeon come back in, and he wasn’t wearing his scrubs; he was wearing a suit. I said, “What happened?”", "He said, “Well, we opened him up, and then we closed him. It was too far gone. There was nothing that we could do about it.”", "There was a situation that was totally, totally unexpected. As I say, he was always an outdoorsman, always healthy. Unfortunately, this has happened. I think it’s absolutely critical—because it is probably the most virulent cancer there is, and unless you’re diagnosed by accident, the chances of survival are very remote. I had an opportunity to deal with it first-hand, and I can tell you, it was a shattering experience for all of us, because it was so unexpected.", "This is something that I think is important. I don’t know exactly how we get around the fact that there’s no way of knowing this is going to happen to you until it happens to you, and then usually, by that point, it’s too late. From that point of view, I think it’s important that we raise the awareness of it, that we have this day to bring attention to it, to do what was done here today, to talk about the people like the president of Apple, who are prominent people who you would think would have the best medical care available and it doesn’t really matter. If you’re going to get it, as I say, unless you’re diagnosed early by accident, the chances of survival are very, very rare.", "I just wanted to share that because, as I say, I had the opportunity to live with it.

We’ve had a great lesson in the medical side of why this is and some other information from the other side of the House. It is so hard to diagnose in the early stages, so by the time it presents, it seems to be fatal.", "Having the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network come forward with this notion to create a day of recognition and acknowledgment is so important. We think about the other diseases that have gone down this route: We have the Becel Ride for Heart to draw attention to heart disease in the province and across Canada and across the world. We have the Run for the Cure and breast cancer awareness. This has been so incredibly important for helping people identify with the disease so that people will both recognize symptoms and get the treatment but, more importantly, will help raise dollars and awareness corporately and socially—social media campaigns—in order to raise the funds necessary to do the critical research.", "To my understanding, there are no early tests to determine—it goes from symptoms. You then start to do your MRI analysis. To be able to find, early on, symptoms of presentation of the disease would be critically important.", "The MaRS institute, we know, has a number of companies and high-tech research looking for cures, looking for early diagnostic opportunities and a whole array of medical conditions, of which pancreatic cancer is one, through a company that I’ve had some awareness with, which is seeking a marker drug called an alpha-fetoprotein, which reveals itself in a cancer patient. They can then put targeted chemo to a cancer cell. They’ve shown tremendous success, potentially, with a drug called Taxol, a chemotherapy drug which is widely used in the advanced stages and has opportunities to cure.", "The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, an American organization which has put together this notion of November 13 to be an awareness day, is also waging a campaign they call “Wage Hope.” This is not about one day a year when we think about the disease. This is about awareness that we can go on and think day to day. I want you to reflect on the campaign of Wage Hope and what that means. When you think about the word “wage,” you’re waging a war. You’re out there. You’re fighting hard for a glimmer of hope—because that really reflects the nature of this disease, where one in seven or 14% of Canadians are expected to get this disease in their lifetime and 1.2% of Canadians are expected to die from it.", "When you think of how important it is that we encourage the research, we encourage the investments, we encourage people—part of the awareness issue may well be that people die so quickly. You do not have a lot of survivors who are out there to help direct public attention to this disease. It’s just the nature of how aggressive and how quickly the disease takes people.", "I get the sense—and I appreciate the support we’re hearing from all sides of the House—that we can do this and declare November 13 World Pancreatic Cancer Day." ],

However, considering the facts, we believe we need to have extensive discussion with all stakeholders to better understand the complexities of the issues involving this bill and make amendments as appropriate to strengthen the bill. I’ll speak about that a little bit more at length.", "The facts are: 70% of plasma use in Ontario comes from the United States’ plasma clinics where donors are paid for plasma. Our system relies on a voluntary system of unpaid donors, not paid donors. The safety and sufficiency of our blood system has been tested before, namely the critically low supplies in 2008 and the tainted-blood scandal that saw 30,000 people receive blood that was infected with HIV and hepatitis C in 1980.", "The Minister of Health has known for some time that Canadian Plasma Resources applied to Health Canada back in November 2012 for a licence to collect plasma from paid donors, but did nothing about it until it made the news. The ministry decided to act in haste when it introduced the original bill, Bill 178. Our worry remains that the urgency of the situation may lead to unintentional consequences.", "As with many of the bills in this House, we believe we need to take a methodic thought process. We need to ensure that we consult with stakeholders. Sadly, in the last couple of weeks, we’ve had a number of bills come to this House that are time-stamped by the government, trying to push those through. We believe this is one of those where it can’t happen. We definitely need to consult. We’re talking about blood services that will impact people at the end of the day, and we want to ensure that there is full debate and full disclosure from all interested stakeholders.", "For these reasons, we must ensure that trust and faith in our blood supply system is maintained. That is why we will be calling on the government to provide significant time for committee hearings on this bill: because of the importance and because of the complexity. It is an extremely complex issue, and I’ll try to provide more details of my rationale as I speak for the next 50 to 55 minutes.", "We’re finding more and more uses for plasma in various medical treatments, so there is going to be an increased demand for plasma. That’s the reality, Mr. Speaker; we know that’s coming. As I speak a little further, we’re going to show that there are times when we may be in a deficiency. We want to make sure that the supply will continue, even if we don’t pay for donations. We need to ensure that there is enough plasma and blood in the times when we need them.", "Again, that’s why it becomes complex. Some people will believe that we should never pay for these types of things, that it may have a negative impact. Others are going to say, “You know what? We’re already getting it from the States when we need it in a slow-demand period, and thus we need to do that.”", "We want to ensure that there are no unintended negative consequences—particularly when it’s impacting the health of those that we’re truly here to serve—arising from the proposed legislation—", "Interruption." ],

We need to do that.", "I’ll get back to my notes in hand, Mr. Speaker.", "There are significant considerations respecting paid plasma donation that need to be raised, and I’ll be doing them on behalf of my colleague, our PC health critic and member for Whitby, Christine Elliott.", "In plasma donations, as I understand it, the liquid portion of the blood, which is plasma, is collected, and the remaining blood components are returned to the donor. Plasma is a yellow, straw-coloured liquid that is maybe 90% water. It provides a transportation system for blood cells. Plasma also helps blood to clot, and the plasma collected is usually given to people with liver conditions, burns or bacterial infections in their blood. Evidently, it is vital to our survival—again, the whole need to slow things down to ensure that we’re doing the proper consultation with the proper people at the table before any decisions are made.", "Plasma can also be used to manufacture plasma protein products. One of the new studies we’re hearing about is the use of plasma proteins in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. As Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias impact as many as 500,000 Canadians today, mostly senior citizens, and we all know that that is probably going to increase as we move through the baby boom generation, it’s even more critical that we pay attention to this and anything that can help if there’s a potential cure for those deadly and horrible diseases.", "I think it’s safe to say that demand for such novel treatments, and thus the need for plasma products, will increase in the coming years. Therein lies the predicament: How do we best ensure that we’re collecting enough plasma to be self-sufficient, which would theoretically amount to 600,000 to 700,000 litres of plasma per year?", "According to Canadian Blood Services, we currently purchase the majority of our products from the United States and Europe. As I mentioned earlier in my leadoff, the plasma sources we purchase are 70% from the United States’ plasma clinics where donors are paid for plasma. The remainder of our supply, the smaller portion, comes via volunteer donors in Canada.", "I’m proud to say that I’ve been a blood donor since, I think, I was about 16 or 18 years old. I try to do it wherever I can. I thank the Canadian Blood Services. As their slogan says, it’s in all of us to give, so those of you out there listening, those of you in the House, those of you who may look at this recording at some point, I encourage you, wherever you can, when it’s safe and practical to do so, to please give. It may be you or a loved one that you are helping somewhere down the road. I applaud all of those in the Canadian Blood Services, the volunteers. Certainly, in our riding we have a number of those, particularly in Owen Sound—the Owen Sound Legion and a fellow by the name of Percy Staight. I think he was about a 20- or 25-year volunteer who organized those clinics with the help of a mass of volunteers. I just want to do a shout-out to all of those people across our great province and across our great country who give their time and energy to collect volunteer blood units on behalf of those who may need them due to other circumstances.", "Interestingly, I’ve also learned that while bodies such as the International Society of Blood Transfusion, the World Health Organization—WHO—and the European Union all strongly stand against paid donation systems, the majority of the world’s supply of plasma products comes from paid donors sourced by the plasma industry. At the end of the day, ensuring a safe blood supply is a challenge for our system. We know blood is scarce. Even though, as I said earlier, it is in all of us to give, there are certain times that people wish not to; there are health implications for some who won’t do that. But I truly, truly do try to encourage those who are able to do that. I know there is one gentleman in my riding—Jim Moyer is his name—who surpassed 400 units of donated blood, which is a pretty staggering amount that he has given back to his community. That was about a year ago. I think I rose in the House and did a statement to acknowledge that at that time. I believe Jim is still a proud donor and goes at every opportunity.", "Mr. Speaker, the average adult carries about five litres of blood. The average unit of donated blood is a half a litre. I’d like to remind the House that back in 2008, the Canadian Blood Services—CBS—issued an urgent appeal for donors, warning that the blood supply had fallen to just a two-day supply. That’s staggering, when you really think about it, when there are so many people who I believe could and should be giving. So I again encourage, and you’ll hear me belatedly through this—and I won’t apologize because I do think it is something we all have to do when we have the ability, is to step up and help our fellow person in their time of need.", "The Canadian Blood Services national office issued a statement warning that donations dropped 40% over the previous two months. So I ask, what if the demand for blood surpasses our ability to collect it? What really happens then? What are the alternatives? What are the predicaments that we may face? I understand that many people will have a very strong principle one way or another with regard to paid donations, but I think what we have to do is look beyond that and ask, what’s for the betterment of everyone? What’s the ability for each of us to really look at the collective need and the collective ability to have a solution to help those in need? Can we guarantee that our existing volunteer model can meet that demand of 600,000 to 700,000 litres of plasma per year?", "Let’s not forget that I shared a little while ago that that’s currently with about 500,000 people, sadly, suffering from Alzheimer’s and dementia in our population. I just met with the executive director of our local Alzheimer Society, Deborah Barker, and we explored and had quite a good discussion in regard to the concerns we share about that baby boom coming through and how many more people in the next 10, 15, 20 years are going to be afflicted by Alzheimer’s and dementia. It’s one that I think, again, may be one of those things we need to be 10 years ahead of the curve on. We need to be thinking today of what the solutions are and how we’re going to address it, have protocols in place, as opposed to waiting for all of a sudden there is a shortage like we experienced a few years ago and then go into panic mode, because some of those agencies that might be able to provide us need to be aware of what the need may be. We need to have that procurement process and strategy in place long before.", "In reviewing the history of blood collection services here in Ontario and Canada, we’re quickly reminded again of just how complex the blood supply system is. We’re also quickly reminded that the system has been fraught with trial and error in the past. For all of us who lived through the 1980s, we’re quickly reminded of the devastation when 30,000 people unknowingly received blood that was infected with HIV and hepatitis C in 1980. It was devastating; thousands of people had their lives cut short because our blood supply system was not safe.", "I’d like to remind the House of some key findings from Justice Krever’s landmark report on how Canada’s blood system managed the threat of HIV and Hepatitis C transmission from blood transfusions. I think it’s important to talk about this landmark report, as it gave us 50 recommendations on strengthening our blood system, which is the crux of this bill. It was, after all, the Krever commission that first recommended against paying donors for their blood. Again, I’m going to cite some information from the Krever report: “As many as 2,000 Canadians became infected with HIV through transfusion or the use of blood products between 1978 and 1985 and 30,000 Canadians contracted HCV through the blood system between 1986 and 1990. Krever’s review of the blood system found fault at all levels, from the Canadian Red Cross Society, to Health Canada, to the provincial and territorial governments, to hospitals, as well as to doctors and their governing bodies. Contamination of the blood supply with HIV and HCV, Krever noted, was essentially inevitable, but failures at all levels made the problem larger than it needed to be. A selection of the findings for each of these players includes:", "“The Canadian Red Cross Society: inadequate screening of at-risk groups and communities; failure to implement surrogate testing … for HCV in 1986; failure to abandon a factor VIII product that was suspected of being inadequately treated to kill the HIV…; unacceptable look-back and trace-back processes in place for notification of donors and recipients of contaminated blood.”", "On the Health Canada side of things: “Lax monitoring by the Bureau of Biologics (the regulator), which should have recognized the threat; no national blood policy that clearly defined roles and authority; reluctance to trace recipients of blood and blood products; passive rather than active regulation of blood and blood products.”", "Again, what we’re seeing—they may have been unintended, certainly, some of these consequences, and probably were, I would suggest, although I wasn’t directly involved. But when we see that there are concerns, what we need to do when we’re looking at legislation is to put it in place to try to prevent these, wherever possible.", "“Provincial governments: a pact to deny compensation to infected claimants; poor surveillance of infectious diseases; failure to properly fund adequate blood screening; failure to build a network of blood manufacturing plants across Canada, which resulted in the necessity to import the product from the United States, where donors were paid and blood was collected from prisoners (practices that increase the risk of contamination).”", "Again, you can see what I’m trying to outline is that there is a lot of complexity. People will have various thoughts on either side of many of these contentious issues, whether it be from a principled point of view or just their own personal viewpoints.", "“Physicians/Hospitals: some reluctance by physicians to tell patients of their HIV status due to stigma; reluctance to trace recipients of contaminated blood and blood products; homophobia.", "“Provincial governing bodies: poor enforcement of physicians’ duty to report infectious diseases.", "“Manufacturers: misleading information provided to and crucial information withheld from Health Canada with respect to product safety.”", "These key findings now form the basic principles of the Canadian blood supply system. According to the World Health Organization, at least 65 countries do not test all donated blood for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis. Tainted blood still accounts for as much as 5% of HIV infections in Africa. The World Health Organization estimates that six million tests which should be done for infections on donated blood are not carried out.", "To repeat comments raised by my colleague and PC health critic Christine Elliott, the member from Whitby, in response to a previous bill, Bill 178: “Plasma obtained from Canadians will be safer, in relative terms. Canada has lower rates of infectious diseases than many other countries, including parts of the US, and Canadians have access to covered health care services.”", "Importantly, I do want to recognize again Canadian Blood Services, who are doing a great job of ensuring that blood donations are safe and that trust and faith in our blood supply system is maintained.", "As I say, I often give blood on a personal basis. I am very, very impressed with the process. I’m impressed with how they have our information catalogued. I’m impressed with the process that they put you through, even as you lead up to actually getting the ability to give blood that day. They put you through a very thorough screening test, even though you’re already in the system. Although you’re a regular donor, they don’t skip steps. They ensure that everything is done according to what their protocol is. To the best of my knowledge, all blood units are tested for transmittable diseases, and there is definitely a rigorous process for screening donors.", "I’m now going to turn a little bit of my thought process to the second component of this bill, which mandates the College of Pharmacists to inspect and license all hospital pharmacies in Ontario. This part of the bill is in response to the underdosing of 1,202 chemo patients in 2012-13. The social policy report titled Diluted Chemotherapy Drugs found that patients in four hospitals in Ontario and one in New Brunswick had received diluted doses of chemotherapy drugs and that the company supplying the drugs was unregulated.", "The contract to purchase these drugs was between the pharmaceutical company and a group purchasing organization called MedBuy. The hospitals were not party to the purchasing contract for the product. The recommendation was that group purchasing organizations and shared service organizations be subject to audits by the Office of the Auditor General of Ontario to provide oversight in order to maintain transparency and accountability in procurement practices in the health care sector.", "We support any improvement to Ontario’s hospital drug supply system and patient safety. Obviously, patient safety is number one, and it needs to be. It’s actually why, in this House, this week and a little bit last week, with the tabling of the Ornge report, I have stood up and I wanted to ensure that there is transparency and accountability and proper oversight in place. It’s a concern that I’ve tried to raise, not being necessarily personally critical of the minister, but we continue to hear in this House: “We’ll do this next time. We’ll take action afterwards.” Yet there has been a lag of two years, in some cases, before we actually get to there.", "What we want to ensure—certainly what I want to ensure when I’m talking about legislation and regulation in this House—is that we’re doing everything in our power to prevent it from happening the first time and certainly the second time. We all have to be diligent, and we all have to ensure that we’re standing here every day thinking of patient safety, constituent safety, taxpayer safety—people. Regardless of what title we give them, it’s all about people and what we’re doing to ensure that they have the most safe practices in our country, in the great province of Ontario and in each of our respective ridings.", "The chemo scandal, sadly, was an example of the Ministry of Health dropping the ball yet again, and we’re definitely looking to the new minister to ensure that this never happens again. That’s why I stand in this House and challenge—my role as a member of Her Majesty’s official opposition is to challenge the government, to ensure that practices are there, and where I think there are opportunities for improvement, to offer those suggestions. We certainly want to be able to be a solution base. We want to accept them at their word that they want to reach out and work in co-operation. But at the end of the day, if we don’t see that, then we’re going to continue to bring these messages to this table.", "I’ve received a couple of pieces of correspondence recently, and I’m just going to reference them here. We received a letter from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. They, I believe, are generally in support of the intent of the bill, and are quite willing, again, to work collaboratively with the government and with all three parties in this House to ensure that there is good legislation going forward. What they see as essential amendments—that’s not saying it’s a “should have” or a “could have” or a “we might do.” “Essential” to me says, “Do not move forward with this policy unless you’re truly going to listen to the input.” I believe the College of Physicians and Surgeons are at the front end. They’re the people who are going to be impacted with regard to this legislation, when it’s implemented, to be the carriers of it, to be the enforcers of it, to be the delivery body of it. So I really think it’s important that we sit down with these groups and that we have a very thorough consultation.", "I’ve also received correspondence from the Federation of Health Regulatory Colleges of Ontario. Again, they’re suggesting, generally, that—I should give a little bit of background. Some of the people at home may not know, as I didn’t—when you become a member of Parliament, you get a lot more information than I ever would have imagined we’d get, on almost an hourly basis.", "In this case, the Federation of Health Regulatory College of Ontario is “the umbrella group for 26 regulatory colleges (including three transitional councils) for the health professions governed under the Regulated Health Professions Act…. Colleges have a statutory mandate to protect the public interest through regulation of health care providers (e.g., registration, complaints and discipline, quality assurance, patient relations program). Together, the 26 colleges govern more than 300,000 health professionals in Ontario.”", "I think we would be abdicating our responsibility, if you will, and our accountability if we did not take time to consult the collective wisdom of 300,000 of our front-line health care practitioners. “The federation”—again, this is right in the correspondence—“supports the objectives on which Bill 117 is based. We believe that the bill has been introduced to enhance the ability of RHPA colleges to regulate their members and pharmacies, in the public interest. It includes provisions to help ensure patient safety, including enhancing the ability of colleges to disclose serious concerns to other authorities, that attempt to close gaps preventing colleges from receiving important information about the misconduct of practitioners and that reduce unnecessary activities that consume significant resources.”", "Again, I want to reinforce here: These are the folks at the front line. These are the folks who are going to be bound and forced, if you will, depending on the decree of the legislation, to move forward. So we need to ensure that we have their input so we do it right. We don’t want to put out legislation at any time, I believe, that is saying, “You shall do this,” without having had proper consultation, without having the input and insights of those people who are at the front lines, who have the best practices, who are looking not just for today; they’re looking at what the consequences are, both good and unintended negative consequences.", "One of the things that I think I’ve been saddened by a little bit, since becoming a member—it’s certainly been a privilege and a pleasure to be here for three years representing the great people of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, and I’m thankful that they re-elected me in the last election to continue to be their representative. I think what we want to ensure is that we have legislation that truly is going to be representative and in the best interests of all the people.", "We want it to be efficient. We don’t want to have waste in the system. We don’t want to do things and then have to come back here and re-debate over and over because we didn’t think it through the first time. Many of my mentors—one of the things that sticks with me is, do it right the first time, because we don’t have the luxury of resources. Right now, our government is in a significant financial crunch. There are not the resources because of mismanagement over the last 11 years. There is a lot of money that has been wasted, and we just don’t have the luxury of being able to redo things.", "This is a prime example of legislation where I think there’s no expediency to have to do this. It’s very contentious. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, there is a lot of complexity in regard to many components of this bill. They combine two different bills, previous health legislation Bill 178 and Bill 117, that died on the order paper, sadly, because we went to election.", "We want to ensure that we’re bringing this back now—let’s do it properly. There’s no big rush. We’ve got a four-year mandate from the people of Ontario, so let’s slow this thing down. There’s no need for the government to expedite it and push it through without having proper consultation.", "I’m going to talk about a couple of specifics that the Federation of Health Regulatory Colleges of Ontario have shared with me and asked that I bring forward to ensure, again, that we’re having that open, accountable and transparent discussion on a topic of this significance.", "They want to question and to get more information, if nothing else, to ensure that they understand the word “discretion” in the registrar’s screening of complaints, sections 12 to 17 of the bill.", "The federation supports the purpose of the amendment and sees it as a very important element in the bill. “Colleges have devoted far too many resources to investigating complaints that do not serve any public interest. We want to devote those resources to complaints that have an impact on the public and would enable colleges to better protect the public.”", "We want to ensure the effectiveness of that word “discretion.” Sometimes a word like “discretion” actually opens the door, in some cases, to an unintended consequence that may not serve the greater need of the bill.", "Another area they have is the area of a time frame. The federation is concerned about the amount of time permitted for the step in regard to looking at complaints or concerns.", "“Complaints are supposed to be dealt with in 150 days”—1-5-0, Mr. Speaker. “By adding this additional step and providing the complainant 30 days to decide whether or not to seek a review of the registrar’s determination, the 150-day timeline becomes increasingly impossible to meet. The federation suggests that in subsection (9) of section 12 of Bill 117, complainants be given 14 days to decide on whether to request a review.”", "Again, I think it’s well thought out. I think it’s a good, rational concern that they’ve brought to our attention. All they’re asking is, let’s have some more discussion. Let’s have open dialogue to make sure that the end product truly serves the people: first and foremost, the safety of the patient, the person receiving the service; and secondly, of course, the service delivery and the front-line personnel that are delivering these.", "They also share a little bit of a concern: “The enhanced reporting duty in Bill 117 now turns on whether the person who grants the member privileges has ‘reasonable grounds to believe’ that the resignation, relinquishment or restriction is ‘related to’ the member’s misconduct, incompetence or incapacity. This is a really high legal test. In such a case, a person who wanted to avoid a reporting duty would simply have to state that he or she did not believe that the action was related to the member’s competence or incapacity, in order to avoid the reporting duty.”", "Mr. Speaker, hopefully, most of our systems are on the merit system and people will do the right thing, but there are certain circumstances when that doesn’t happen. I think we have to ensure, when we’re writing legislation, utilizing words like “discretion,” that we have to be more black and white. We have to give people clear, defined terms, so that they all are working from the same page; we’re all in the same ballpark, talking the same language and understanding it so that we don’t go through this myriad of administrative bureaucracy and spinning paper for the sake of spinning paper.", "In many cases, the people on the other end need timely results; they need to be able to move through the system properly. I think we need to do due diligence in that case as well.", "“Appointing college supervisors, section 9 of the bill:", "“Under the bill, the provisions permitting cabinet to appoint a supervisor over a college will be modified. The federation appreciates why this amendment is being proposed. The federation urges you to raise concerns that you may have with a particular college early and often so as to resolve concerns and to avoid, wherever possible, resorting to this extraordinary power.”", "Again, I think the reality here is that they’re saying there are mechanisms; there are ways we can ensure that there’s a timely, efficient process, and let’s not let it get bogged down in administrivia because of the unintended consequence of a certain word, term or definition.", "“Additional exceptions to the confidentiality duty, sections 10-11 of the bill:", "“ ... three new exceptions have been created, enabling colleges to disclose otherwise confidential information. The proposed new grounds for disclosing confidential information are as follows:", "“(1) for the administration of the Health Protection and Promotion Act (e.g. concerns about communicable diseases);", "“(2) to a public hospital in relation to a pending complaint or s. 75 registrar’s investigation in accordance with regulations initiated by the minister; and", "“(3) to any other person named in the regulations, in relation to a pending complaint or s. 75 registrar’s investigation in accordance with regulations initiated by the minister....", "“Colleges have access to information that sometimes can be of assistance to other regulators and participants in the health care system. However, the importance of the information varies significantly. Some of the information would not be of much value to others (e.g., alleged rudeness by a practitioner). Some of the information could be of significant value to others (e.g., about communicable diseases; about a developing pattern of treatment errors or risks). In addition, even where the information is significant, there is great variability as to the reliability of the information.”", "They’ve given me very, very specific situations that I think are good to feed back to committee. Hopefully that’s where this bill will go: back to a committee that will take the time and effort to consult widely. They need to ensure that that happens. But I think what their concern is is that you don’t want to add unnecessary administrative burden. You don’t want to add things into the system that are going to slow things down and not allow answers to be made in a timely and efficient manner, Mr. Speaker.", "I want to ensure that I’ve conveyed the proper message today. You have two pretty significant groups, both the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario and the Federation of Health Regulatory Colleges of Ontario, that generally are supportive. I’m not going to quote, but I think they’re generally supportive of this bill. They just want to ensure that we’re doing the right thing and that we slow things down to make sure we get it right the first time.", "I want to just give a little bit of an outline as well in regard to—again, I’m going to repeat—Bill 21, Safeguarding Health Care Integrity Act, 2014. There are actually six acts that are going to be impacted: Drug and Pharmacies Regulation Act, a new one; Health System Improvements Act, 2007; Laboratory and Specimen Collection Centre Licensing Act; Public Hospitals Act, a new one; Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991; and Trillium Gift of Life Network Act.", "I want to reiterate what I said earlier in regard to schedule 1, Voluntary Blood Donations Act. This schedule 1 prohibits the sale of plasma or blood products in the province. This is in response to Canadian Plasma Resources setting up locations to collect and compensate donors for plasma. I’m not really going to get into a discussion today, Mr. Speaker, and try to convince people whether you should or shouldn’t believe that there should be an organization or entity able to do this. What I think I want to bring more to the people of Ontario, and certainly to the people of this Legislature who will ultimately make the decision, is that there are options that we need to be looking at. There are situations where I think we can’t just be closed-minded until we at least explore all available avenues and get the true facts on the table and look at it from all sides, which is what I think most of us do. Certainly that’s what I try to do every day when I come here from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. I want to make sure I have the facts, I want to look at both sides of an issue and I want to make the most educated, balanced decision that I can.", "Currently, Ontario does not collect enough plasma to be completely self-sustaining. I’ve said a number of times in this House already in this short half-hour—it may seem long to you, Mr. Speaker, but for me it has been a short half-hour so far—that I think we have a tremendous voluntary outpouring of support to give blood. But I’m not certain, with some of the things I’ve suggested to you with regard to Alzheimer’s and dementia specifically, but even just with our seniors’ more acute-care needs out in our communities—there are a lot of situations. My colleague Laurie Scott from the nursing practice industry—really, what it comes down to is that I have the utmost respect for nurses. I worked at Bruce Peninsula Health Services Foundation, right beside the Wiarton Hospital, at the bottom of the doctors’ offices in Wiarton. What I saw were nurses, day in and day out, giving their heart and soul to those patients. You know why they did that? Because they truly are caring, compassionate people. But at the end of the day, I think what I really gleaned from them the most is that they put everything aside except the first and foremost principle of their day: the health and well-being of that patient sitting in front of them. I think this is the type of thing with blood services that we need to be thinking about, because that supply of blood may become critical to someone’s life in a very distinct situation.", "I heard, I think last night, on an ad as I was listening—I think it was television; I can’t remember if it was television or radio—that they were asking if the public knew how many units of blood are needed for one car accident victim. Some people said, “Five,” and they said, “No.” Someone said, “Twenty,” and they said, “Double that, plus”—so 50 units of blood for one car accident victim. Again, we need to ensure that we have that supply. I can’t give enough credit to those people who truly do voluntarily give of themselves. It is in you to give, as I’ve said. I want to just give that plug for that line a couple of times while I’m here today.", "We need to be looking. What happens if we don’t have that supply? Where do we go to get that supply? I’ve shared with you that the plasma and the plasma protein that we need to derive from blood—right now there’s about 600,000 to 700,000 units, but that is purported to increase. Where are we going to get that? Can we guarantee that the voluntary sector will be able to step up if that doubles in the next five years? I’m not certain. Yes, Ontarians and Canadians are the most giving in the world, but we can’t guarantee that, so we need to be prepared. And the Minister of Health, regardless of what stripe, is responsible for that at the end of the day. I think what you want to do is set yourself up for success. You want to set yourself up to ensure that you have protocols and a backup plan in place. So it is a very complex discussion that we need to be having.", "Ontario collects enough plasma for transfusion but does not produce enough plasma protein products to be entirely self-sufficient. We currently purchase 70% of our plasma protein products from the United States, from paid and unpaid donors. I want to spend a few minutes on this because, again, there are some people who have certainly talked to me individually, anecdotally, saying, “I just don’t believe in paid. It’s the wrong thing. It’s not ethical. It’s not the right way to go.” Again, I’m not here to convince you one way or the other, nor even try to go down that road. What I want to say, Mr. Speaker, is that you may actually be getting a blood unit right now that is from the United States, which actually was done through a paid donor.", "I think we can’t be closed to the fact that if we don’t have enough volunteers and your loved one, your child the age of our pages and younger, needs that unit of blood, at the end of the day, are you going to make that a real discussion about whether it was a paid or unpaid donor of blood? If it was one of my sons, Zach or Ben, lying in a hospital bed needing a unit of blood, whether it’s paid or unpaid is going to be way, way back on my list of concerns at that time. What I want to know is that when my child—young adult; they probably don’t want me to call them a child anymore—is in that situation, the blood is there and available to them when they need it. This is life and death at times. We don’t have time to go back and consult. We don’t go back in time to review this policy. We need to ensure that it’s in place.", "Plasma is often used in pharmaceutical products that help combat Alzheimer’s and hemophilia. It has been addressed that we could have a shortage. We need to understand what those realities are. We need to explore it with people at the front end of the table, the stakeholders, the people who are truly in the business and truly understand the ramifications of what we’re talking about. I think when this originally came into the House, there was a fairly short discussion more of the ethical side of things, but I don’t think we ever spent enough time truly making sure that the public was informed. As a consumer, I certainly had no idea of the types of numbers we’re talking about. I had no idea that there could be shortages like that. To be honest, I didn’t even know that there was paid or unpaid. Fortunately, no one in my family at that point had needed to have a transfusion, although I did lose my dear sister Marge to cancer a number of years ago, and she did end up having some blood transfusions.", "Again, as I said a few minutes ago, at the end of the day, whether it was paid—you know what?—if it was going to help keep my sister alive, I don’t really care where that came from. Some people will hold those very highly. That’s fine, and I’m open to that. But what I want to do is make sure that this bill addresses the true needs that are out there, the true shortages that we could be experiencing somewhere down the road—not too far down the road, particularly with that baby boom coming at us—and I think we need to ensure that we have a system in place that we’re all comfortable with, that we’re actually very comfortable and confident in our government of the day and our agencies that are going to provide, that we have the blood supply in place.", "I want to touch again on the fact that much of the blood we bring in, 70%, comes from the United States and/or Europe, and that blood, in many cases, is from a paid donor. There are certain times that obviously we want to ensure that we can get all of it, but I think it has been stated clearly by a couple of different groups in our research that there aren’t sufficient resources, so we have to look outside and look at new ways of doing this.", "I want to talk really briefly, Mr. Speaker, about schedule 2, which talks about amendments respecting the regulation of pharmacies and other matters concerning the regulated health professions. Although he’s not here right now in the House with us—I think he’s out doing some meetings. Dr. Jeff—I don’t know if he’s actually a doctor; I call him the mad scientist, but he’s a pharmacist in any case, and I believe “Dr.” is part of his title, although Jeff would never want that to be used. I have to say it’s been an absolute privilege, along with my colleague Laurie Scott, a nurse whom I’ve already referenced—having them right in our caucus; in fact, in front of me right now, that I can ask a question, has been absolutely a privilege and a value that I can’t say enough about.

But thank you for the offer; very kind of you.", "The Regulated Health Professions Act allows cabinet to appoint a supervisor to a health professions college when necessary.", "All of these things, again, have merit. They have probably the right intent, but let’s take time to really have open dialogue and discussion, to ensure that we’re doing the right thing at every step.", "The bill would prohibit the sale of plasma, a concern from the previous session—again, valid. Even today, we had a very solemn ceremony to start off our session of Parliament this morning, looking forward to Remembrance Day next week, from all the three speakers, who I believe did an absolutely admirable job of truly speaking about what’s important to us collectively as Canadians, Ontarians and just citizens of this great and wonderful country, and that is to be able to have open dialogue and dissenting views and be able to say them wherever and whenever you wish, without fear of reprimand. I think we all need to hold on to that near and dear, and this is one of those. People are going to come on either side of this issue, whether to sell or be paid to give blood or not, but I think what we want to do is ensure that we put the big need out front. What is that need going to be down the road? Whether it’s a year down the road—it could be in a month. We could have some kind of catastrophic incident come into our province, and we would need that supply of blood. We need to be prepared. We can’t be saying, “We’ll study it for a couple of years” or “We’ll get to that somewhere down the road.” We need to be on top of that.", "About two and a half weeks ago with the Ebola scare, one of my jobs and one of my roles as opposition critic was to challenge the current Minister of Health, saying, “Are you truly prepared? Have you got your plan?” Equally as important is the communications plan so that everyone involved is ready when that incident may happen in their community or in their home base—in a riding, in our case. What I want to ensure is that all of our hospitals, our health units, everyone was on a coordinated basis and ahead of the game. They weren’t waiting three days after something happened to say, “We’ll have a plan.”", "The minister, I think, has learned some of the lessons from SARS. I believe that he and the interim public health director have things relatively in hand. But also in that case, I heard from hospitals in my jurisdiction, as well as from some of my colleagues, that hospitals were being forced to put in some potential protocols of buying equipment, doing training, so that they’re prepared. On one side, that’s a very valid and admirable way to do it because you want those people to be prepared, but then if you did more research, the reality was, “What is that impacting currently?” because a lot of our hospitals are working on shoestring budgets. There’s going to be overtime for the training. You’re going to be bringing in supplies on a budget that may be very close to not being able to be balanced.", "When I asked when those hospitals would be compensated for those extra measures that were directed by the minister, he said, “Trust me; the money will come.” When? No answer, Mr. Speaker. That didn’t leave the hospital administrators, who have a very challenging job—how they would do that.", "Then you start to get questions from your constituency, saying, “So, if you add”—let’s just say—“$100,000 into a budget for one of those hospitals that are already at the line from a deficit perspective, what are they pulling out of there?” You’re either pulling out people, programs or services. Certainly in rural Ontario there isn’t a lot of fat in the budgets that I know, and I work pretty close to the hospital sector.", "What I want to—again, not that you don’t want to have the ability to take action, but sometimes, do we really need it to the full bore and go overboard when there are going to be daily health impacts? Are we going to cut a service to someone currently for the potential of what happens? I’ll admittedly agree that that’s a daunting balancing act for someone like the Minister of Health because if he’s not prepared, then there are going to be concerns; if he over-prepares, then there are going to be impacts today.", "But what I’m trying to say—it again says, “Let’s have a balanced approach.” Let’s understand, with all of the people who can bring good knowledge to the table, and let’s do the best that we can to put that in place proactively. Let’s have positive public discussion. Let’s have it out in the communities, like Bill 10, the Child Care Modernization Act.", "I still can’t understand why a government who purport to be education leaders would not allow people to go out into the community, from all three parties, to have that discussion: to truly say, “We’re listening to you Ontarians collectively. We want to understand,” and then we’ll come back to this honoured House and create legislation that will truly be representative and serve them in their best interests.", "That is one that you’ve heard a lot of discussion about in this House in the last couple of weeks. You’ll continue to hear about it. I think you’re going to see some public rallies from people out there who don’t feel they’ve been served properly because that bill was moved forward so quickly without public consultation. I just don’t want that to happen, certainly with a bill like Bill 21. Blood can be life or death. If you’re that person—and again, my colleague sitting in front of me, Laurie Scott from—" ],

It would make it illegal to pay or offer to pay for blood or blood products, including plasma. This is one, again, where I think that that complexity, that personal way that you look at this issue—you know, you may go on either side. But for me, if my son, any of my family or friends or anyone in this House is lying in a bed and the whole issue is whether you want to pay or not pay—if that’s the reality, if you’re 100,000 units short tomorrow, I think that you want to find a solution that is going to allow us to get that supply back to where we need it to be.", "If it has to be paid for, particularly when there are other jurisdictions that are already doing it—I don’t hear any horror stories, to be honest. I haven’t seen any major media scandals about it in the United States or Europe, where they do this.", "Again, if the facts speak for themselves, we actually import blood products today that are via paid donations, so at the end of the day, even on the moral side of it, that unit that you have allowed for your loved one to be transfused could be from paid. I can probably stand pretty comfortably saying that not, certainly, any family member that has had the luxury or the benefit of blood donation is going to come back and say, “I want you to take that out, because I’ve now learned that it was paid for.” If it’s going to save the life of a loved one, then I think that we have to be open to that, and we have to be looking at the reality that there could be a shortage, and how we are going to address that.", "Bill 21 provides an exception for Canadian Blood Services to pay for blood or blood products in an emergency situation. Again, an emergency in my mind suggests—that doesn’t mean that you’ve got two weeks to debate this and call down to somewhere to get a supply. An emergency, particularly in an emergency room setting, is minutes—seconds—so you want that blood supply available to you. You want it sitting there in the hospital so that that patient immediately receives that service and that transfusion. You can’t be saying, “Well, yeah, it’s an emergency, and we’ll get to it in a day, a week or an hour.” You need it there, so I think we need to look at that.", "Bill 21 allows research studies to compensate for blood or blood products. However, this does not include research studies with pharmaceutical products. Well, again, Mr. Speaker, I’ve shared with you earlier today about the realities of Alzheimer’s and dementia, and there is some value in plasma products being used to potentially provide a solution, and hopefully a cure.", "Certainly that’s what I hold out for; I’ve unfortunately had some family members afflicted with dementia and Alzheimer’s, and it saddens me, as it would all of us in this House, to see anybody go through any of that type of illness if there’s a prevention. So we need to ensure with legislation that we’re not inadvertently, unintentionally putting consequences in place that would ever prohibit us from being able to do that.", "Again, for me, if it’s the case that you don’t have enough because of a lack of a voluntary supply, and you can find a way to make that happen in a viable manner from paid donations, then I think we have to look at that, and I would be prepared, I think, to at least explore that reality and really understand just where the public does lie on it. I’m not certain in my riding, to be absolutely honest, that I’ve had anyone truly bring this to me for or against paid or unpaid, so it’s something that I think, again, having a good, frank discussion, having the ability to go out and meet with stakeholders who are going to be impacted, is certainly the way we want to go with this.", "Again, schedule 2, the Drug and Pharmacies Regulation Act: I just want to touch on that a little bit more. It sets amendments that would classify all community and hospital pharmacies as pharmacies for inspection purposes. I think, again, the intent here is probably admirable. The whole idea is that we’re going to treat all facilities in a like manner so that they’re all getting inspected. Being proactive in inspecting and ensuring that there are no shortfalls or gaps is a good thing. I think that is certainly a wise step forward to making sure that there are inspection protocols in place.", "I think there is a fine balance for this type of thing. Again, many of the things I hear across my riding, not necessarily on blood but on a lot of things, is the over-administration—now we’re putting 15 inspections in place that are just wasting people’s time, particularly private industry, who don’t have the luxury of a lot of spare staff. They’re running on very shoestring budgets. The abattoirs were one of those where I heard continually that the overburden of inspection—you had regulated inspection by the federal guys; you had provincial folks coming in. It became a point of, “When do I ever serve my customer? I’m spending all my time doing yet another inspection report.”", "To the end degree of those, most are highly inspected and regulated. I think we always have to strike a good, fair balance. From a health and safety and wellness perspective, inspections are a good thing: The ability to send someone in who is looking at it through a fine filter. But let’s not overburden business and/or public institutions that are then taking away—and I will always be the person who stands here and says that our absolute, first and foremost thought process should be about the patient or the front-line care and service that we provide. If anything administrative and bureaucratic is not adding to the value of that, then I think we have to have a good, hard look at it and say, “Is that really what we want? Is that really what we can afford?” And I don’t mean afford in the financial context. I truly mean resource-wise. When you’re hearing about waiting lists of all varieties, what are we doing to get rid of those and to get more people through the system to get the care that they need, as opposed to holding someone to account for yet another report and yet another inspection?", "So that one—again, I think I like the intent of it. I certainly have the thought process that it would be to ensure that there are the best and safest practices in each of our facilities, whether it be a pharmacy in a hospital or out of hospital, but I think we just want to make sure that we’re, again, not setting the table where there can be unlimited inspections of those types of facilities.", "As I’ve mentioned here, the biggest thing with this bill is that we’re taking six different bills and we’re trying to lump them all in. We saw this again the other day with a piece of legislation, and I think in that case, we referred to it as an omnibus bill. There were 12 different acts that were involved. Regardless of anything that you’re doing, taking 12 legislative acts and combining them into one certainly gives me concern at times. How thoroughly have we gone through those? What are, again, the unintended consequences, perhaps, of trying to combine and bundle those all together? Are we going to lose some of the good pieces? Are we going to lose pieces of that legislation that are not going to be of benefit to the people of Ontario, who we are here to serve?", "In this case, I think we’ve taken a number of different acts—this was tabled earlier as Bill 178 and Bill 117, and now rolls in seven acts. I’m a little concerned about where we’re going. I’m concerned, particularly—I don’t want to belabour it, but I do want to put it on record again that, in this House in the last couple of weeks, we’ve actually had time allocation come through for some of the bills that we were agreeing to debate and wanted to debate. We wanted to have full, open accountability and transparency. We wanted to have the ability to consult the people that we serve. We wanted to go out into the community. It’s always good, I think, to go out and meet with the stakeholders, the people on the front lines, so that they feel comfortable and confident that they’ve had their input and they’ve been able to bring thought processes that might be of value, that are solution-based, that might improve our systems. If we just continually think, “We can do this in the ivory towers of downtown Toronto,” I don’t think we serve the people well that we’re truly given the privilege to serve. I want to make sure we always slow down and take the time to do those types of things.", "On the broader thought process of health care, I think we need to be looking at all processes that we have, all systems that we have, and ensure that they’re meeting the needs of today. The health funding formula for small, rural hospitals is one where I’ve always had concerns that we’ve used a formula that has been in place for a number of years. Many things in the world have changed since those formulas were designed. It probably worked extremely well back in the day when we had lots of resources, lots of financial surpluses. We’re certainly not in that situation today.", "When I look at the amount of debt and deficit that the Liberal government has accumulated and the amount of money that we’re spending every year on interest payments that aren’t going to the front line of health care, it causes me concern when you bring any bill into this House and see that it’s being expedited and steamrolled.", "Even the title, Safeguarding Health Care Integrity Act—we need to ensure we consult with those who are most impacted. We need to ensure that the doctors and the nurses at the front line are certainly part of the process and understand the implications, even the good intentions.", "As I referenced to you earlier, Mr. Speaker, we’ve had a very credible organization, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, come and bring their comments, and they’re generally supportive of the bill in its first intent. But they came to us as the official opposition, Her Majesty’s loyal opposition, to say, “We need to ensure that we have the ability to consult, that we can give you good, positive, constructive feedback to make sure that this legislation is effective.” I think most people out there would think, when a group like that is taking the time to come to us, that there is some validity and that we will honour that by trying to push for those times to debate the various pieces of the legislation.", "Again, the Federation of Health Regulatory Colleges of Ontario—a federation of 26 regulatory colleges representing and governing more than 300,000 health professionals in Ontario. I’m not certain how anybody in here could refute, when somebody’s representing 300,000 health professionals, that talking about the Safeguarding Health Care Integrity Act would be a good idea. We want to ensure that we do that.", "We want to ensure the ability of people to have a blood supply, and that’s what I think we’re coming down to here. We know that our older demographic is moving through. The baby boom is coming through. It’s going to create a whole lot of situations that today we may not be facing. But we can’t wait until after the fact. We can’t wait, and we certainly don’t want to see things like the Ornge fiasco happen, where, again, a lot of resources were wasted, a lot of things happened that were inappropriate, and certainly not for the benefit of the patient. We want to ensure that we’re not going through that.", "And then we get a report, and I’ve been pushing again in the House here to ask the government of the day, and particularly the minister and the Premier: What are you going to do with that report? If you don’t implement and you don’t really go back and make sure that the oversight and accountability are in there, then you are doing a disservice to the people of Ontario. It can’t happen again. We just can’t allow that to happen. Regardless of how it happened the first time, we can’t allow that to happen, not when we’ve had the ability—and we had an all-party committee agree to these recommendations. We can’t allow that to happen.", "I certainly bring to this revered House my thought process of trying to have balance, to be able to look at both sides of any issue to find the truth, the facts, and again, put people at the front of every decision that we make, particularly in health care. Regardless of whether I have the title of health care critic or not, I will always have that as my absolute core, because at the end of the day, that’s what we’re all here for. We want a healthy, productive life for every single one of our citizens, from those great pages who have served us for the last number of weeks to the seniors who I love to spend time with and everyone in between.", "I want to take my last few seconds and really say thank you again to all of the pages, those who are in the House and those who aren’t in the House, because when we stand here debating a bill like Bill 21, the Safeguarding Health Care Integrity Act, the decisions we’re making in this House will impact you today and they will impact you for many years to come—not just you, but your loved ones. You truly are the leaders. You’re the next generation. We’re going to pass that torch to you. What we need to do in good service to you and to all of the people of Ontario is ensure that when we’re bringing bills like this, when we’re bringing legislation, we’re looking at it in a balanced manner and we’re engaging all of the front-line stakeholders who actually can bring positive, valuable contributions, and ensure that at the end of the day we have practical, balanced legislation that is going to be enacted for, truly, the betterment of the health and the care of those people we are given the privilege to serve." ],

There’s no question that we want to see this legislation pass.", "I hear the member make references from time to time about time allocation. I can recall when I was opposition House leader that while there was a lot of protesting about time allocation, in their heart of hearts very often the opposition actually wanted the government to impose time allocation because then they could denounce it. In fact, when I was government House leader, I recall time allocation being imposed over a pay raise, and the then leader of the third party, now deceased, came to me at that time and said, knowing that he didn’t have unanimous support—and he wouldn’t mind having me tell this story. But he came to me and said, “Do you have any time allocation motions?” I said, “I have six. Which one would you like?” And one of the six I pulled out—I said, “But you’re going to denounce the fact that I am implementing this time allocation motion.” He said, “Yes, that’s part of the game, but you recognize that’s it.”", "We’re working hard with time allocation to get consent, but when it’s necessary we will allow for a programmed way of dealing with bills." ],

She mentioned that there are a lot of restrictions on who can give blood. She thinks that’s one of the reasons why we have blood shortages, that we have too many restrictions. I thought it was going to be medication or something like that. Obviously, we can’t take blood products from people who are on some medications or have health histories that aren’t conducive. But she mentioned that she was asked if she had had any medical tests. She had had a colonoscopy within the month, and they asked if she had the results. She said she hadn’t gotten the results yet. They said, “Well, then, you can’t give blood.” She mentioned somebody who had been to Europe maybe 10 or 15 years ago and was told, “You can’t give blood because you were in a certain city or a certain country”—and not a Third World country. Maybe that’s something that we have to look at. Maybe we have too many restrictions.", "Maybe the fact that people are so busy and spending so much time in their cars in gridlock means they don’t have time to go give blood. Maybe we have to have mobile units going to people’s workplaces more often.

There are oodles, as we say in our language, parliamentary language—oodles and volumes of speeches in Hansard dating back many years when that particular member would be just vitriolic against the government for using time allocation, and saying time allocation by any other word is time allocation; it is a closure of debate.

We have to have good, thorough discussion. We need to be out in the communities. We’ve had a number of organizations—the Federation of Health Regulatory Colleges of Ontario, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, and a number of other groups and organizations—that have spent time lobbying us and telling us that they want to ensure that we have fulsome debate on this and input from those stakeholders who are at the front lines. There are opportunities for research. There are opportunities to look at things through a new lens.", "As I tried to reinforce through all of my talk, we need to worry about blood security, certainly. We need to worry about the blood supply. How we get there and whether people are opposed to paid donations or whether we want to continue to try to do it voluntarily are certainly matters that everyone has their own right to have an opinion on. But at the end of the day, I think what we need to do is have legislation that ensures that when the time is there, we have an adequate supply of blood so that we don’t lose one single life because we did not put legislation in place that was practical, efficient, balanced and reasonable.", "Mr. Speaker, it’s been an absolute pleasure to discuss this on behalf of our PC health critic, Christine Elliot, from Whitby—I always get those—" ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much. My apologies for my lack of knowledge on the procedural component of that.", "As I was saying, I will begin my comments around the first question: looking at blood donation and the purpose or principle around voluntary blood donation.", "There’s a lot of discussion around blood donation as a public resource, that voluntary donation encourages a certain quality in our system. I think it’s important to start looking at this. Our position is that I think we have a very strong culture and system of voluntary blood donations, and supporting that is certainly an important step.", "I think we also need to look at what are impacts to society on a payment-based blood donation system. How does that affect our society? How does that affect people? And what does it say about the type of world we live in? What are some of the ramifications if we have a system that’s based on payment? How does that impact the lives of those people who may be affected by blood donations? More importantly, those who don’t have the means to support themselves, people who are vulnerable in our society: Where does that place them in terms of payment-based blood donation systems?", "One of the concerns I think is raised is that if you have a system where you are paying for anything in the health care system, it raises the question of the motive. We’ve seen, time and time again—in the health care system, do we want a system that’s driven by a profit model or a system that’s driven by sustainability? Do we want a system that’s based on what will give us the lowest cost and the highest revenue? Or do we want to look at a system that’s driven by quality of care?", "I think there’s no doubt, when it comes to our health professionals—our doctors, our nurses, our midwives, our institutions of care or hospitals—we certainly believe that quality should take precedence over profits, that we should be driven by sustainable decisions that would create a system that’s long-lasting and decision-making that creates the best quality of care. I think that discussion translates very well into this discussion around blood donation. If we want to encourage a strong, sustainable system where we can rely on blood donations that are voluntary, arguably it encourages a higher quality of supply, but it also speaks to that principle that in health care, we don’t believe that profits should come into play. They shouldn’t form a factor in our decision-making. It’s a slippery slope, and it could erode the fabric of our health care system, so there’s a reason why a number of health care providers have indicated their support for banning the for-profit plans around blood plasma collection. The Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario, the college of physicians, Canadian Doctors for Medicare, the Council of Canadians, Canadian Blood Services, as well as the Ontario College of Pharmacists, have all indicated their support for banning plasma collection. There’s a reason for that—because I think it speaks to their support of public health care and their support of a system that’s based on quality over profits, and I think that’s the right decision on that.", "Now, some questions have been raised. I think they’re important questions, and I think it’s important for us to look at this, given that we’re examining our system now. Some of our blood supply, whether we want it or not, at the end of the day, if we rely on outside sources, if we rely on blood or plasma from the United States or if we rely on blood or plasma products from Europe—in those jurisdictions, they are actually using a for-profit model, so at the end of the day we have to look at our system and the integrity of our system.", "If we believe, in a principled decision, in ensuring that we don’t have a for-profit system to collect plasma, but we’re relying on other sources of plasma which are for-profit, I think that that’s an important discussion. I think it’s important for us to look at how we can make our system more inherently consistent, so that we’re not relying on outside sources that are for-profit.", "At the end of the day, I think the issue that was raised by my colleague in the Conservative Party was that, if we have shortages, if we have circumstances where we don’t have adequate supply—what do we do in those cases? I think that that’s something that is covered by the bill in the form of, if there are exceptional circumstances, there may be an exception to this ban. Of course, it’s certainly something to note.", "But what I also have to draw attention to is the fact that, for a number of years, the Liberal government has been aware of this problem. There has been at least one example—there have been a number of them, but there’s at least one clear example—of a for-profit clinic that has indicated its desire to basically set up a for-profit model and have that set up here in Toronto. For two years, the government hasn’t really taken any initiative on this issue, and I think it’s worth noting that delaying taking action has sent a message that the government is not serious about this issue, and now we’re having to play catch-up.", "I think that that’s something that we want to see the government move away from. It’s important to make sure that our decision-making is not done in a reactionary manner; we need to be more proactive with our decision-making.", "I think that’s a great segue into the serious and very tragic scandal or tragedy of the diluted chemotherapy drug incident. You know, 1,200 patients were impacted by this. It’s a very serious situation where people who are among the most vulnerable people, people who are at a very serious point in their health, who are facing one of the most scary moments of their life, when they’re faced with something like cancer—they rely on our health care system to assist them in that.", "The fact that these individuals who, in terms of their health, are so vulnerable, and are relying on a health care system to give them the medication that they need to make sure that they are able to recover from this serious illness—they found that the drugs that they were prescribed were diluted, were not sufficient, were not providing the right attention to their needs. It was something that we were all struck by. I know that my seatmate from London–Fanshawe was particularly impacted, because a number of the folks who were impacted were actually from the London region." ],

There were people who were impacted across Ontario, but the fact that there seemed to be a higher number of folks from southwestern Ontario was quite troubling.", "This is a serious area, and this is another example of—we entrust our government with one of the most precious things, our health care. It’s something that we spend the most money on in terms of our budget, and rightly so; it’s something that we really care about, and it affects people in a very meaningful way. It’s our biggest budget item. It’s a very precious and very valuable item in terms of making sure that our citizens are cared for and receive the appropriate health care.", "But the problem is that, time after time, we’ve seen the government drop the ball on oversight and drop the ball in terms of not having the appropriate measures and appropriate oversight in place to ensure that everything that we do invest in, the health care that we do provide, is the best value for money and is providing adequate care. There’s a list now that’s building—and it’s troubling—of scandals and times or moments where the government has not provided the appropriate level of oversight. We can talk about Ornge and the number of red flags that came up, and despite those red flags, the inaction on the part of the government in terms of responding to those serious problems with our air ambulance system. When we look at eHealth and the serious waste of resources there that could have been used in a more effective manner, to actually provide front-line care—the approximate billion dollars wasted with eHealth is also quite troubling.", "This is another example where people who are vulnerable, who are faced with a serious life-threatening illness didn’t receive the medication in a manner that would have helped them. It was a very troubling circumstance. Now, the government is responding by ensuring that there is greater oversight. I acknowledge and I salute the fact that the government is taking the right step now. Again, I would love to see—and I know citizens of Ontario would like to see—the government take proactive steps instead of reactive steps. We would like to see the government, instead of waiting for a scandal to happen and then responding, take steps ahead of time to prevent them from happening in the first place. The government has that ability, the government can do that, and it’s not taking the right steps.", "Another example which connects very well to this is in schedule 2 of this bill: The government is taking steps to further regulate the pharmaceuticals through an amendment to the Drug and Pharmacies Regulation Act. Another step, if the government was serious about oversight—this is all about oversight. We have a health care system that is robust, one of the best in the world, but we need to make sure that it receives the appropriate oversight to make sure it does the right job. Now, if you’re serious about that—and you are taking some steps here with the pharmaceutical schedule 2—but the problem is that you have another amazing tool that could actually provide some real oversight, and you’re not making use of this tool. The Ombudsman of Ontario is a world-class oversight leader, someone who has time and time again shown his skill. His office has shown tremendous proactive steps in terms of making sure that we are receiving the best care in all spheres, whether it’s in the recent child care issue, whether it’s policing—the Ombudsman has done a great job. Why is this government not including the health care sector in the Ombudsman oversight?", "We’ve seen the government now finally take the step to include the MUSH sector—the municipalities, the universities and the schools, but they’ve not taken the steps to include the hospitals and health care. The Ombudsman has clearly stated that the office is ready to take that step. The Ombudsman himself has indicated that he is willing to make sure that that oversight falls on his office, and they’re ready to do it. They’re the most skilled individuals and most skilled office at dealing with oversight, but you’re still failing to take that step.", "I ask, if you’re serious about oversight, and particularly in health care, which is one of our most precious commodities, then please, allow the Ombudsman to have oversight over the health care sector—and we would prevent things like this from happening. That would be a proactive step because, on the ground, individuals could complain, and it could be individuals affected, it could be health care professionals—there is a wide gamut of people who could complain directly to the Ombudsman, that could initiate an investigation, and we could see some immediate steps taken, instead of this tragic situation where 1,200 people are affected in such a dire and devastating manner. So I ask you, if you’re serious about making sure that there is strong oversight, that you ensure that we have the Ombudsman included in this discussion and expand his responsibilities to include the health care sector. That’s my recommendation in terms of real oversight.", "In terms of the steps that we need to take to improve the current system around oversight when it comes to pharmaceuticals, the bill will extend the oversight authority of the College of Pharmacists to include pharmacies in public and private hospitals. The College of Pharmacists already has a role, has a duty in terms of managing their members and ensuring that the members are of the highest standard, of a standard that’s appropriate for Ontario, and they do a great job. They already have the infrastructure in place to make sure oversight is conducted for their members. Expanding that to include pharmacies in the public and private hospitals is a much-needed step. It’s something that should have happened a long time ago, but it’s an appropriate step. The folks who are in charge of the College of Pharmacists, like I said, have the expertise in this field, have the resources in this field and can ensure that oversight is established.", "The college will now have the authority to license and inspect pharmacies within public and private hospitals in the same manner as it currently licenses and inspects community pharmacies. That is something that obviously provides the oversight that we need in the hospital and private hospital regime, so it’s a step in the right direction in terms of expanding much-needed oversight.", "If you look again at the bill, there are two straightforward areas that we needed the government to take some steps on. There was the issue of blood donations and the issue of the pharmaceuticals. The government is taking steps now in a reactionary manner, but certainly taking the right steps.", "I want to ask a number of questions, now that I have the opportunity to do so, with respect to the recommendations that Dr. Jake Thiessen put forward in his report in July 2013. He made 12 recommendations. This bill addresses the final recommendation, recommendation number 12, which states, “The OCP”—the Ontario College of Pharmacists—“shall license all pharmacies operating within Ontario clinics or hospitals.”", "My first question is, why was it the case previously that this wasn’t being done? Why was it the case that there was no oversight over these private clinics in hospitals? Why was this simply overlooked? Again, if we’re talking about oversight, we have another very serious issue brewing in our health care sector. If you’ve seen the problems that arise when oversight isn’t present, you’ve seen that there was the serious scandal of 1,200 patients, 1,200 people—more than that—1,200 families impacted. We know this is a problem. We know there are recommendations set to address this.", "We have another problem brewing, and that’s in the expansion in the use of more private clinics, broadly speaking. What is this government doing to address that issue? We’ve recently heard of outbreaks in terms of infections at private clinics. We’ve heard about some serious problems in terms of the standards of these private clinics. We’ve seen a shift in terms of the health care system moving from the public sphere into the private sphere.", "I ask the government again, if you’re serious about oversight and you’re taking these two steps now, to look at the private clinic model as well. What does that say about the importance that we hold for our public health care, the fact that we believe in a one-tier system, that everyone is entitled to quality health care? What does it say about our system when we have private clinics and this slow privatization of our health care system? It’s a serious issue, and I ask you to look at that more carefully.", "We as a party, the Ontario New Democrats, strongly support a public health care model. We believe that everyone is entitled to quality health care, and we don’t want to see the system eroded. More importantly, whatever system we have in place, it’s the government’s responsibility to ensure that there is proper oversight of it. If we have private clinics right now that are not receiving proper oversight, if their standards of quality and their standards of care are not being examined, this falls solely on the shoulders of the government to do so.", "We’ve raised this issue through questions in the House. Our health critic, France Gélinas, the member from Nickel Belt, has raised this issue.", "I’m asking you again, if you’re concerned about health care, and you’re raising these two issues, please look at the private clinic model and ensure that we have oversight so we don’t see another tragedy, another scandal, unfold and thousands of lives impacted again.", "Indeed, if you’re serious about proactive steps, include the Ombudsman in health care sector oversight, and he will ensure that there is an independent watchdog to make sure we have the strongest health care system." ],

If this act is passed, we’re going to do it in a number of ways.", "The new legislation would prohibit payments to individuals for their blood and plasma. It would strengthen the government’s enforcement powers in the case of violations, and it would expand the criteria considered for licensing blood collection facilities, making sure that we have the regulatory amendments in place also that prohibit any licensed lab or specimen collection centre from paying for blood and plasma donations, including reimbursement of expenses.", "So we are taking a number of steps to ensure that our blood supply is safe, and we are trying to make sure that this blood supply is safe for all Ontarians, all Ontarians who are ill, and also that there are things in place for the future.", "Encouraging people to give blood, as one of the members mentioned earlier, I think is a great idea.

That process is something that in the past has been routine from time to time, and in other eras there have been times when governments have chosen not to take that route on important pieces of legislation, thinking that they know best, that they can get it right the first time.", "As we’ve learned, sometimes through very hard experience, it usually is the appropriate course of action to take the time to get it right, to refer the bill to committee, and sometimes to have committees that travel around the province to get input from all corners of the province, not expecting all the groups and individuals to come to Toronto, but going to their communities to listen and hear what people have to say.", "I would ask the member for Bramalea–Gore–Malton: Would he agree that this bill would be strengthened through extensive public hearings and would he support that?

Dr. Thiessen came and reported on it. Our health critic, France Gélinas, sat there diligently, listening to these recommendations. Out of the 12 recommendations that Dr. Thiessen recommended—people should listen on the other side; the government should listen on the other side—one of those recommendations was taken into effect in this bill. How can you justify not listening to the expert in oversight when it comes to the underdosing of chemotherapy drugs, when people were compromised?

But at the end of the day, when it comes to particular technical bills, we need to solicit the expertise of those folks who are leading in that field.

It is quite hard to follow my colleague from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound on his hour leadoff on this bill—lots of information on this bill. The subsequent speakers who have spoken have added to the debate.", "Basically, the bill is a couple of bills from the past rolled into one. When you’ve heard the debate previously about wanting it to go to committees, it is complex. I’m a nurse, and I can’t tell you all the exact needs—the plasma and the plasma protein therapies part of the bill. That’s why I think we want to have extensive committee hearings: to make sure that we get it right because that’s probably one of the very controversial parts of the act, and the amendments to the Voluntary Blood Donations Act.", "There’s also the Drug and Pharmacies Regulation Act—which it affects—the Health System Improvements Act, Laboratory and Specimen Collection Centre Licensing Act, Public Hospitals Act, Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991, and the Trillium Gift of Life Network Act. When you’re affecting that many acts, you want to get it right, to make sure we know what we’re talking about.", "The schedule that I’ll speak about that is affected, and I’ll probably spend most of my time speaking about that, is the plasma and the plasma protein therapies. Just for a refresher, if anybody has tuned in, we call plasma “liquid gold.” It’s that yellow-coloured liquid that makes up about 55% of the total blood volume. It can be obtained either through regular whole blood donation or through a process called plasmapheresis, where blood is collected from a donor and then the plasma portion of the blood is separated out, and the red blood cells and formed elements from the blood are returned to the donor. That’s kind of why it’s liquid gold, because it’s so essential. Boy, when you’re in trouble in the hospital and you need plasma, you need it now. It is usually used for patients who are bleeding severely and they need it to help clot that blood.", "My colleague from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound spoke about the shock that he was in around how many blood transfusions and how much plasma are involved in people who come in from car accidents. Sometimes they replace their body fluids seven times over until they get them stabilized, hopefully, and they survive such emergencies and tragedies.", "Plasma can also be used to manufacture plasma protein products. One of these products is known as IVIG, which shows early promise of success for treatment of Alzheimer’s. I wanted to read some of the plasma protein therapies and the diseases they treat.", "Albumin, which is more the clear liquid that you’ll see—I could be a little dated from my nursing days—and it usually came in a bottle. It’s for shocks, burns, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, so after bypass. Albumin can be used for that; I’ve given it many times myself to patients while I was nursing.", "IVIG, which I just mentioned, is an immunoglobulin. It’s primarily for immunodeficiency diseases, autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and idiopathic thrombocytopenia. It’s been a long time since I used words like that.", "Alpha-1 antitrypsin is used to treat genetic COPD, and then the coagulation factors from that are used to treat hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand disease and bleeding disorders. So that’s just the plasma protein therapies and diseases that they do treat.", "If you’re a patient who has to receive for a chronic disorder many of these transfusions—for one patient, for one year, with primary immunodeficiency disease, 130 donations are needed; with the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, 943 donations are needed; and for hemophilia A, 1,237 donations are needed.", "I think you have to put that into perspective, and I say that because a portion of the bill is about compensating for donations—so, clearly, Ontario does not collect enough plasma to be completely self-sustaining. It collects enough plasma for transfusion but does not produce enough plasma protein products to be entirely self-sufficient. I know it might be a little dry, but when I list all the treatments that it can be used for, you start to get the idea that there are lot of people being treated. We currently—and this is the situation; you have to deal with reality—purchase approximately 70% of our plasma protein products from the United States, from paid and from unpaid donors. We just cannot collect enough here. That is one of the parts of the bill where I think you do have to hear a lot of feedback about how we deal with this in the real world.", "In April 2013, Health Canada held a round table in Toronto on the whole issue of payment for the plasma. During that round table, the presentation by the Canadian Blood Services—and I will, if I could, read an excerpt from that—was from Graham Sher, CEO of the Canadian Blood Services at the time.", "“Dr. Sher explained that the Canadian Blood Services currently purchases bulk pharmaceutical products from the US and Europe that are made from plasma,” like plasma protein such as albumin, “on behalf of provincial and territorial governments for use in Canadian hospitals. These products are made from several plasma sources, including volunteer donors in Canada and the US, and paid donors in the US. He emphasized that internationally, the use of paid plasma in creating plasma protein products has been a common practice within the pharmaceutical industry for decades, and that the majority of the world’s supply of plasma products comes from paid donors sourced by the plasma industry.”", "Later on, Dr. Sher stated that “between 600,000 and 700,000 litres of plasma for fractionation”—which is a separation of the products—“per year would be required for Canada to become self-sufficient and meet today’s demand, and that collecting this amount of plasma with a volunteer model is not operationally or economically feasible.”", "I know, as I said, it’s quite a bit of a controversy about paid and unpaid donors within the bill, but you have to look at the medical scene and the reality that exists here, and how are we going to get around that?", "I don’t know if some of you remember the Krever Commission and the tainted blood scandal that occurred in the early 1980s, where 2,000 Canadians were infected with HIV by tainted blood products and as many as 30,000 more were infected with hep C—and I have several of those constituents in my riding. It is estimated that nearly 8,000 of those who received bad blood are expected to die as a result, and, unfortunately, I have had some of those cases within my riding also.", "Now, as well as facing a blood shortage and weighing the pros and cons, Health Canada and the Canadian Red Cross turned to the international market to purchase blood products for Canadians during that time. Some of those products were purchased from blood brokers whose supplies came from high-risk populations. Remember that the 1980s was the height of the AIDS epidemic in North America, and this imported blood was being inadequately screened before entering our system. So it was certainly a period of time—we don’t have that at the moment. The screening is far, far better, made better by a lot of recommendations from the Krever inquiry.", "It says that after months of hearings and four years of investigations, Justice Krever released his landmark report—1,200 pages. Don’t worry; I’m not going to read all 1,200 pages here. That was in 1997. It took a long time.", "They fundamentally found that the relationship between the Red Cross and the federal and provincial governments was dysfunctional and that Canada lacked a cohesive national blood policy. He outlined some basic principles of the Canadian blood supply system that I’ll read:", "Blood is a public resource.", "Donors of blood and plasma should not be paid for their donations, except in rare circumstances.", "Whole blood, plasma and platelets must be collected in sufficient quantities in Canada to meet domestic needs for blood components and blood products.", "Canadians should have free and universal access to blood components and blood products.", "Safety of the blood supply is paramount.", "Certainly, those are all fundamental good ideas that were brought forward in recommendations. He basically said that profits should not be made from the blood system. We know that supply and demand, life and death is the balance here. Safety is paramount. We do have a lot more safety nets, a lot more filtering in order to make sure that blood products are certainly safe for everyone to use. Canadian hospitals buy the bulk of their pharmaceutical products from the US and Europe, like I said. This is not new. It’s been common practice for decades. I know some of the controversy is about a company that’s going to collect, for payment, some blood products within Canada. We have to be very careful in balancing the proper rules and regulations with the need that our health care system finds itself in.", "I know that there are some associations—for sure, several patient groups are concerned about the impact of the bill, and they’ve written to us to make sure that they are kept apprised of when this bill will have its hearings. They include the Canadian Immunodeficiencies Patient Organization, the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders, the Canadian Hemophilia Society and Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Canada Inc. That is why we say the bill has got some complex ethical issues, but it also has some realities of the health care system, so we have to balance those out.", "There’s another section of the bill, and it’s an amendment respecting the regulation of pharmacies and other matters concerning regulated health professions. I think we all value our pharmacists that are in all of our ridings. I certainly know, in my riding of Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock, the pharmacists are the front-line health care providers. More people have access to them, and therefore they are seen by many people who need, for sometimes just minor ailments, a little bit of guidance. They were here—for the last couple of weeks, I think, the pharmacists were here. They are asking about their scope of practice being increased, which I fully agree with. I think they’re under-utilized in their profession and they could help take the burden off our health care system immensely by treating minor ailments. They are a fountain of knowledge; I think that we all know that. But the Bill 21 that we’re speaking about today redefines hospital and community pharmacies to all be considered as one type of pharmacy in terms of inspection—so, again, making sure we have the right regulations to safeguard our citizens in health care when they need to receive these health care medications.", "The Public Hospitals Act is also going to be impacted, in providing greater reporting to the College of Physicians and Surgeons when a physician leaves through misconduct. This allows for greater transparency in government. It makes physicians more accountable.", "So, as you say, from time to time, bills need to be looked at. We’re not opposed to that, and I think that those are things that make absolute sense in this bill.", "It also allows cabinet to appoint a supervisor to a health profession college when necessary. I think that’s very fair.", "When the government wants to bring these bills in—and as I said, this has been a couple of bills folded into one. We’re just not talking that it’s easily debated. We said that, in general, we’d like to get this to committee and have full committee hearings.", "I see that the time is almost done. I see the Speaker rising—" ],

For over three decades, I served my community as a broadcast journalist for CTV News, anchoring and producing the current affairs program Provincewide.

If you want to see this plan in action, I encourage you to come to Kitchener Centre, and I know you don’t live far from there. In the past decade, our city was facing the same difficult economic realities as many other Ontario communities: factories shutting down, people losing their jobs and a declining downtown core. But our community was built on an entrepreneurial spirit. We are dreamers and doers, and we love a challenge.", "The first Europeans to the Kitchener area, who arrived in the early 1800s, were self-reliant, hard-working German Mennonites from Pennsylvania. Many more immigrants followed, and soon they established the town of Berlin, which came to be known as “busy Berlin.” However, with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the anti-German sentiment grew in the area, and the name was changed to Kitchener, following the death of the earl of Kitchener.", "During the latter half of the 19th century and the 20th century, our stock in trade was manufacturing, big and small. We made tires at Uniroyal, shirts at the Arrow factory and Canada’s first colour TVs at Electrohome. But when the tide of changing global forces swept across much of North America, Kitchener’s industrial sector was hard hit. We saw numerous one-time successful manufacturers shutter their doors. Unwilling to be relegated to the rust belt scrap heap, the dreamers and the doers in Kitchener got to work on a comprehensive action plan. Playing a critical role was our former MPP, John Milloy, who supported Kitchener mayor Carl Zehr and the local council in a bold and daring plan to attract development and create jobs, optimism and momentum.", "In 2009, we saw the launch of our life sciences cluster. The Downtown Health Sciences Campus was open for business, consisting of the University of Waterloo school of pharmacy and a satellite school of medicine of McMaster University. These institutions are graduating needed health care professionals—and this has gone a very long way in addressing the doctor shortage in our area—and the new medical cluster has become a magnet for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.", "Just down the street, a block away, in what used to be a leather-tanning factory, the Communitech Hub is delivering stunning results in the digital media sector.

After receiving some mentoring and some excellent coaching and getting connected with the right people, he set out on his own. I’m very happy to report to you that today Andrew’s company is one of the rising stars in this nucleus of tech innovation. His downtown Kitchener office has 25 employees, not just in Kitchener but also in a subsidiary office in Los Angeles. His clients include DreamWorks, the Jim Henson Co. and NBCUniversal, just to name a few.", "A very small investment in this young man has gone a very long way in creating knowledge-based jobs in our community. Consider that the people whom he is employing now pay rent. They buy houses. They buy cars. They get oil changes. They buy groceries. They buy running shoes for their kids. They are reinvesting in the community where we live. His father and I are very proud of him.", "Adding to the innovation cluster is our commitment to clean technology. Kitchener has always been a leader in its concern for preserving our environment. We were the first community in Canada to implement the Blue Box recycling program, back in 1983.", "Our “Go Green!” philosophy promotes walking and cycling and the redevelopment of once-empty factories—and we had many of them. We’re turning these old factories into housing. This is a prime example of recycling that is transforming our city core.

The old Arrow factory, where they made men’s shirts, is now also a condominium development.", "We know that if we are going to attract investors and high-calibre talent to live and work in our community, we need to improve transit. With support from the province, residents of Kitchener and Waterloo region are soon going to see the implementation of a light-rail transit system, and we’re very excited about this.", "The LRT has been on the drawing board for over a decade, and I’m told that, in the very near future, we are going to see groundbreaking for this world-class transit system. It’s going to serve as a catalyst for downtown intensification. Fewer cars on the road mean less traffic and cleaner air.", "All-day, two-way GO train service between Kitchener and the Toronto area is certain to be a game-changer. Rather than facing the traffic-choked Highway 401, where hours are lost every day in gridlock, travelling by train will not only make good economic sense for businesses but it’s going to help people to regain precious time being lost in our lives. We all have appointments to keep and people we’d rather be with.", "We also look forward to breaking ground in 2015 for the new four-lane Highway 7 between Kitchener and Guelph.", "The people who are working diligently to maintain a strong economic presence in Kitchener Centre are also committed to supporting culture.

We have one of Canada’s largest multicultural communities, with almost a quarter of our population born outside of Canada.", "Mr. Speaker, I count my own family among this group. It was in the late 1950s that my parents, Carmine and Antonietta Vernile, emigrated from southern Italy to Canada. They were in their early 20s and they had very little money in their pockets. In fact, I think my dad says he had about 50 bucks in his back pocket when they arrived. They heard that Canada was a land of opportunity, so like thousands of other people who immigrated here, they made the long journey to the shores of this country, hoping to find a better life for themselves and their children.", "My parents arrived in the north end of Toronto, because that is where other family had settled. With only grade school education to serve them, my father worked in construction all his life, and my mother toiled away in a dry cleaner’s, pressing shirts for 18 years—this was before air conditioning. She also cleaned houses, and she held various factory jobs.", "We were very poor in those early days. My two older sisters and I wore second-hand clothes that my mother picked up at church rummage sales.

But with the support of caring teachers in Ontario’s excellent education system, we soon learned that Canada was indeed the land of opportunity. Our education system is the cornerstone that empowers young people with knowledge and confidence to help them tackle every challenge in life. At school, we were all equal—equal to learn, equal to set goals and, through hard work and dedication, equal to achieve any dream. How many other places in the world can make this claim?", "My dream was to become the first member of my family to attend post-secondary education. This was a pretty lofty dream, considering my father only had a grade 5 education, and my mother, grade 3. The war had cut short their education. So off I went to Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo to study history and politics, juggling four jobs in order to pay for tuition, books, and to keep a roof over my head. With no financial support from my family, the financial picture at times was very grim; but I knew I’d get through it, and it was thrilling to be there and to be learning at a higher level.", "My first job as a broadcast journalist was with multicultural CHIN Radio. After a few months reporting in the newsroom, I was appointed to the station’s Queen’s Park legislative reporting position. I sat right behind you in that media gallery, reporting on the daily events. I never would have imagined back then that I would one day be here in the House, sitting as a member—and it is humbling.", "After CHIN Radio came an offer to work for an ABC affiliate TV station in south Texas. That was such an interesting experience, and it showed me more than ever that aside from the weather, Canada, with its tolerance and compassionate social programs, was where I wanted to live.", "Returning to Ontario to work for CTV in Kitchener, back then called CKCO-TV, it was a great privilege for 29 years to produce and anchor an award-winning weekly news program. From this perch in Kitchener, I was able to interview Prime Ministers, Premiers and even some American Presidents. Our reports covered issues like politics, business, education, health care and more.", "But the stories that were the most gratifying were those where we were able to improve someone’s life by putting the spotlight on an inequality or a social injustice. Our report on a church community cupboard for the poor brought in a flood of donations which were very much needed at the time. We reported on a downtown soup kitchen requiring a washer and a dryer, and the very next day after the story aired, an anonymous donor provided the needed appliances. An interview with a woman who was dealing with breast cancer, who was humiliated inside a driver’s licence renewal office when she was made to take her hat off for a picture revealing her hairless head, prompted me to call the then transportation minister. He offered an apology on the air, and she got to retake her picture after her hair grew back. This is what drew me to a career in journalism: knowing that you can use the media pulpit to bring awareness and to create change.", "There are some who might see journalists and politicians as natural enemies. It’s often a blood sport, with the two sides very suspicious of each other. Yet at the very core, reporters and elected officials want the same thing, and that is to help people. Reporters do it by reporting on important information and educating the public. Politicians help the public by passing policies and laws which allow people to live their lives in dignity.", "When the opportunity came a few months ago to run in Kitchener Centre, my first concern was, would I be able to live up to the legacy of John Milloy? In the 11 years that he served, John secured for our community a new courthouse; a new shelter for abused women; extensive funding for our two local hospitals in the region, our two universities, Conestoga College, support for the Centre for International Governance Innovation, for the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, for the Institute for Quantum Computing; and as I mentioned previously, a new school of pharmacy, a new medical school, funding for the LRT and GO train service—such great accomplishments by one person in one riding.", "Mr. Speaker, for me it came down to the core values of the party I was about to join, the integrity of the leader and the ideas moving forward. I had a chance to speak personally with Kathleen Wynne, and she shared with me her vision for creating a strong and compassionate Ontario. It was very inspiring. As a cynical old reporter, I will say that I’m not inspired by a whole lot of things these days, but I was inspired by Kathleen Wynne.", "I’ve also been inspired by my wonderful husband, John Matlock, and our three children, Andrew, Curtis and Claire. You heard me talk about Andrew. Our middle child, Curtis, recently graduated from the Royal Military College in Kingston with a degree in political science. He has just accepted an offer to go to law school in England. Our daughter, Claire, who is also studying at the Royal Military College in Kingston, has just finished her second year in English literature. She is an infantry reservist in the Armed Forces of Canada.", "It was my family that strongly urged me to pursue this opportunity, and in particular, it was the kids who told me not to be risk-averse. This is a message in our family that has come full circle. When our children were younger, on many occasions I encouraged them not to be fearful of new experiences, like the time that I signed us up to volunteer at the St. John’s soup kitchen in Kitchener. It’s a drop-in centre that feeds 300 people in need every day. I’ve never forgotten the early struggles of our family, with my parents trying to put food on the table, so this seemed like a natural fit for our family when it came to volunteering. On Thursday afternoons for over a decade, our family would slice carrots, peel potatoes and do whatever else they asked us to do to help prepare the meal for the next day. Social justice is a very important value in my family.", "It is encouraging to see in the throne speech a commitment to introduce a new poverty reduction strategy within 60 days. The Breaking the Cycle plan has lifted 47,000 children out of poverty in this province, and the recent increases to the Ontario Child Benefit and the minimum wage, with annual increases indexed to inflation, aim to ensure that low-income families do not fall further behind.", "Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that as a broadcast journalist, I covered elections for over three decades and I thought I understood the complexities involved. However, when you are the candidate at the centre of the events, it’s a whole other matter. When we launched into the campaign, my husband and kids and the extended Matlock family worked tirelessly until the very end. Our outgoing MPP, John Milloy, canvassed by my side, and, in an ironic twist of events, role-played with me, with him acting as the aggressive reporter and me trying to answer his blistering questions.", "Leading the charge in our election campaign was a team of passionate volunteers who put in long hours, plotted our strategy and worked tirelessly to win every vote. I was humbled by their unwavering dedication every day. And on election night it was overwhelming to see such strong support from the residents of Kitchener Centre, who chose a more positive vision for the future. I was very worried about this election. I was looking at some of the polls in the days leading up to election day. My campaign team ordered me to stop looking at these polls because it was very tight. However, on election night—I’m going to use their words, Mr. Speaker—they said, “Daiene, it’s a landslide.” So thank you to all the voters in Kitchener Centre who voted for us.", "By allowing me to serve over the next four years as their member of provincial Parliament, my goal is to represent their interests and their needs. Although we are fortunate to live in a province with so many advantages and opportunities, I believe that we can still do better. People are demanding that we manage their tax dollars more effectively. Believe me, I heard that, while knocking on doors, from many, many voters in Kitchener Centre. But they also want the fair delivery of services that allow them to live their lives in dignity, and they don’t want to see any sector of our workforce demonized.", "We need to strike a balance and we need to strive toward our mandate: building Ontario up. There are so many things that we need to build in my riding and across the province, starting with every child’s potential, competitive businesses, new transit, a more comfortable retirement for all seniors, and a fair and inclusive society. We’ve all heard Premier Kathleen Wynne say that government can be a force for good in people’s lives. I stand before you here today as living proof of the possibilities. My life started out in poverty, and I struggled with language and cultural barriers, but hopefully I’ve become a person who has benefited from Ontario’s many opportunities. I’m honoured to serve in this government and I hope to continue adding value in this great province.", "I want to thank you for the time to speak and I thank the good people of Kitchener Centre for their support." ],

I actually walked to school, about two miles, and yes, it was a one-room schoolhouse and I didn’t speak any English. I could count, though; I could count. Math was okay.", "I think my father really felt sorry for us, so come that summer, we moved to where most Italians who moved close to Toronto moved to: It was Toronto.

But I did go to high school. I did become an auto mechanic, and I’ve been self-employed pretty well all my life around the automotive industry. We made a living; we raised our family. For the last 34 years we’ve lived in Brighton, which is, of course, in the great riding of Northumberland–Quinte West. We have a family business that one of my kids is slowly taking over, and that’s a speedway where they race cars every Saturday night. So we do make some noise. But it’s something that I’m very, very fortunate one of my kids was able to pick up where I’m leaving off. They’re doing, as I said, a great, great job.", "Speaker, I just want to focus a little bit on being here. As I said before, I’m an immigrant; my wife is Canadian. It’s a real privilege to be here. Sometimes, I guess, as you get a little bit older, you become more cognizant of these things, so I just want to paint a little bit of a picture. Back in Italy, during World War II, my father was a prisoner of the Allied forces. I married my wife, Diane. Her father was a veteran of World War II. I often wonder if my father was a prisoner of my father-in-law. It kind of gives you a little bit of a chill, but it’s reality. My father was lost for about five years during World War II, but then he came home, and that’s why I’m here.", "I guess what I’m getting at is, this is a fantastic country. It’s a great province. I have parents and my wife has parents both from different backgrounds during World War II, but I’m here to sit in this House today.

In October 2011, after spending eight years in this place—people spoke of my riding—by a very small amount, I wasn’t able to return here. But what encouraged me to try again is that, a couple of months after I lost that election, over 300 people showed up at a gathering to honour me, and it was very, very moving. These folks said, “Yes, you lost the election. You’re gone. You’re finished,” but about 300 people paid some money to host an event to honour the work I was able to do as an MPP for eight years. Once again, it was one of those moments that was quite touching. I had pretty well all of the municipal leaders, and other agencies attended, and friends. I made a statement that day. I lost by 700 votes, so I said to those folks out there, “I could’ve saved you some money tonight if each one of you could have had two more votes.” Anyway, they took that to heart, and they never relinquished it. I made a comment that night in my remarks, after hearing a number of accolades, that I wasn’t bound to go away. I’ve lived in the community for over 30 years. I raised my family there. My business was there. I wasn’t going to go away. “The sun will rise someday.” It wasn’t the end of the world. It wasn’t going to be dark.", "Speaker, fast-forward to June 2012 and the time leading up to it. I want to thank the fantastic team who rallied around me. I normally don’t like to name names, but there are some times when you’re going to name names. I’ll probably forget, but I want to thank Elaine Palmateer and Bruce Davis, the co-chairs of my campaign, with big help from Michael Gray, Charrissa McQuaig and about 300 to 350 others—a team of volunteers who were out there to support and get me back to this place.", "I’ve got to tell you a little story, Mr. Speaker.

We only had a couple of members from rural Ontario. I volunteered my time to do some outreach to help the party rebuild in rural Ontario, Speaker, and it was a great opportunity to still meet people, all different groups, both within the party and outside the party. They offered an enormous amount of ideas, and hopefully, as I fed them up the chain—I think some of the results were seen during our platform. So for me that was great.", "But at the same time, most of the people that I dealt with, whether it was mayors, agency leaders that I had the privilege to interact with in a professional sense as an MPP—they still came to me for help and assistance, so you kind of felt you never left. It was really, really fantastic to stay connected. I think that helped me during the campaign because I knew what some of those needs of the communities were. I knew what potential venues we could take care of at Queen’s Park if I was fortunate enough to be re-elected, what we could do. It was an awesome experience to do those kind of things, and I certainly enjoyed it.", "Mr. Speaker, I just want to spend some time to talk about the great communities that I represent. As I said before, during the campaign, we had five campaign offices, in each urban centre. I’ll start with Port Hope. Port Hope is a great community. All the communities are great communities; we’re very, very lucky. Northumberland–Quinte West has boundaries to the west, which is Durham, Newcastle—not counting Newcastle. To the south is Lake Ontario, to the north is Rice Lake, and to the east it’s just past the Trent River to Loyalist road. We’re right on the lakeshore, we’re right on the 401, we’re right on the VIA, so it truly is the centre of the universe. I don’t want to offend anybody, but it is.", "In Port Hope, we’ve always worked very, very closely. A couple of things that come to mind in Port Hope is that during a previous government, they lost their driver test centre, the only one that was close, within probably 50 or 60 miles. Whether you were a youth trying to get your licence or a senior who had to go through the testing to make sure that you could retain your licence, they would have to go to Peterborough, Oshawa or Belleville. It took a little while, but then, under Minister of Transport Wynne, now Premier Wynne, we were able to re-establish that driver test centre.", "Speaker, I can’t help but tell you a story about the driver test centre. We had an elderly lady from Bewdley, which is in the north end of the riding near Rice Lake, who had lost her licence through—I won’t go into details why she lost her licence, but I know she was having a good time. So she had to do a test. We knew that a driver test centre was going to come back to Port Hope, and Port Hope to Bewdley is only about five or six—well, maybe seven or eight—kilometres. But she didn’t want to go to Peterborough or Oshawa or Belleville. I mean, she was in her eighties. We kept telling her, “Well, hold on tight. We’ll see what we can do.” The day that we knew that we were going to re-open this driver test centre, we said, “We’re going to”—I won’t mention her name because the family wanted to keep it a little bit private. We said, “What a great way if we can get Mrs. So-and-So to come and be the first person to come to the centre.” We thought it was a real win. I personally phoned her house. A gentleman answered the phone. I found out later on it was her son. I told him the good news, and he says, “Lou, I really, really thank you, but Mom should not be driving, so I’m not going to tell her the good news.” But anyway, the centre has been well received, and it adds, certainly, service not only to Port Hope but the surrounding areas.", "In Port Hope, we were also very successful to tackle a number of projects—in fairness, with the help of the federal government and the municipality: a number of water projects and a number of brand new sewage treatment plants, things that that community really needed drastically.", "Then there’s the municipality of Cobourg. Cobourg once again has a fantastic waterfront, a downtown on the beach. You couldn’t ask for much better, with a beautiful marina park. It’s just a phenomenal community, a vibrant downtown, a very historic town hall. One of the things that Cobourg needed was a community centre of some magnitude. They had a hockey rink that was quite old. Once again, with the help of the federal government, I was able, from the provincial side, to come up with about $10 million in partnership with the federal government and the community. They now have a state-of-the-art community centre: two hockey rinks, an indoor walking track, meeting rooms and basketball courts—you name it.", "But I guess one of the things that former Mayor Delanty—he wanted to leave a legacy; he wasn’t going to run for mayor again, back, I believe it was, in—well, the last election, the municipal election of 2010.

That’s what I heard at the door, and I’m sure everybody heard, that before we finalize those things we need to hear back from those folks, now that we have a majority government, now that we have formed government again, to make sure that we line up issues to the best of our ability.", "I’ll tell you one thing: People understand that we have challenges; they really do. One of my sayings has always been, even in the days I spent in the municipal sector, when someone approached me with the issue—to them that’s a very important issue; that’s why they’re coming to us, right? I would always say, “So help me out here. How would you fix it?” It is easy to complain, “I don’t like the colour,” or whatever. I go, “So what colour would be best?” Normally, they would have a suggestion. But you know, if we are able to explain that maybe it is a good suggestion but because of A, B, C and D it didn’t quite fit the equation, they would understand that. They would understand, whether it’s financial issues or whatever the case may be.", "I think if we’re honest with people, if we tell our story, if we express where we want to go—because people are also patient. That’s one of the things that I actually sold during the campaign. What we’re saying is not for next year; it’s not for the next four years; it’s a 10- or 12-year plan. The eight years I spent down here, I never heard of that before. This is very, very encouraging. As a municipal leader—and I know there are lots of municipal folks here—when we met with the province we used to say, “We just can’t fly by the seat of our pants anymore. We need to be able to plan.” Because normally you can save some money when you plan. I think the direction that we’re taking is a phenomenal direction. But we need those partners to work with, whether it’s municipally, whether it’s the health care sector or the economic development sector, whatever that might be.", "One of the things I found out when I was doing outreach for the Premier’s office was that people were really happy that somebody was asking them, “So what do you think?”—to be part of the process. They understood that we could not satisfy all those needs, too. They really did understand. But one of the comments that I used to get whenever I met with chambers of commerce or agricultural groups was, “So you’re here to listen to me, and you’re going to tell this to somebody in government?” I said, “Of course; that’s what I’m here for.” “Well, that’s never happened before.” That’s something that, for the next four years, in the riding of Northumberland–Quinte West I’m going to keep on doing.", "I was doing that before, but that just kind of reinforced that we need to do more, because a lot of good ideas come from the grassroots. They come from the folks that we in this room collectively have the privilege to represent. They really depend on us. The direction we’ve taken, being back here 20 days after an election is unheard of—and the commitments we’re making.", "Speaker, it has been about half an hour. I think I’ve said enough. I see you’re still awake, and I would certainly like to keep you that way. Thank you for listening to a few words I have to say." ],

The government is clearly living beyond its means, but interest rates today are at 20-year lows; they can only go up. It matters because each point increase in interest rates on the debt of almost $300 billion by the end of this year could add a minimum of $3 billion in annual interest payments, which would severely cripple Ontario’s ability to deliver services.", "It’s plain for anyone to see that we face a dangerous amount of financial risk in this province.

It will be the young, the disabled, the poor, the disadvantaged, the needy and the vulnerable all across Ontario, as front-line services are put in jeopardy.

Already, Ontario’s borrowing costs have spiked to a six-month high the day following the last election, just last June 13.", "Despite all the evidence and advice, this government has decided that there’s no need to detail how they will magically balance the budget to protect front-line services. In fact, they have decided to double down on debt.", "The Premier downplayed the debt hole, the finance minister advised that no one was freaking, and the President of the Treasury Board says that she isn’t worried about it. These denials of reality all remind me of their constant reassurances that we should all trust them when they claimed that the gas plant scandal cost taxpayers $40 million, when it really cost at least $1.1 billion.", "This government still will not answer how they can possibly balance the budget by spending $12.5 billion more than taxpayers can already afford. Spending $12.5 billion that we don’t have, and which will cost all Ontarians more in future taxes and service cuts, is not an investment, as the Premier likes to say. It’s a crippling burden on all businesses and families in Ontario.", "Not only is the government promising the impossible—balancing the budget by spending more money we don’t have—it is in absolute denial that it bears full responsibility for the situation that it has dragged all of us into. We keep hearing the same excuses: “Blame the feds. Blame the economic environment”—anyone but the Liberal government of the past 11 years.", "A study from the School of Public Policy, released last week, took a look at the root causes of debt accumulation across Canada. The report concludes that Ontario is in much worse shape than Quebec, and it’s not the fault of external factors. It expressly lays responsibility on bad policy decisions by this Liberal government. Instead of denying responsibility and accountability, this government would be well advised to take the first step towards recovery, by admitting that they have a problem.", "It truly worries me that the finance minister believes that the main issue is that “revenue has not met expectations.” Does this mean that, along with the inevitable service cuts, we should brace ourselves for even more taxes and fee hikes, because he thinks revenue has not met expectations? Even with the HST, eco-taxes and the so-called health premium—and it goes into general revenue—to name just a few, how much more money is the government going to take away from us, the taxpayers?", "It’s not like they’ve used our money wisely: more than a billion dollars in the gas plant scandal; hundreds of millions more on Ornge, eHealth and MaRS. At the same time, we’ve seen services that vulnerable Ontarians rely on, like physiotherapy, cut, or we see how badly they treated Madi Vanstone, in my riding, who needs medication to live.", "We’ve seen front-line cuts: 40 nursing positions cut in North Bay, 90 nurses put out of work in Ottawa, and 34 nurses shown the door in Windsor, to name just a few. Clearly, it’s just the tip of the iceberg. There’s a lot more to come, yet this government claims that it needs more money for its activist-centred approach to government. Please, you’ve been too active with our pocketbooks already, and no one buys your voodoo economics claiming fiscal restraint when you’re spending more money than ever.", "The claims of having the leanest government in Canada per capita are a red herring. We should darn well expect that, with the highest provincial population, our per capita expenses have to be lower. Any student taking an introductory economics course—which is as far as I got in economics, Mr. Speaker—would be able to tell you that, of course, per capita costs are lower as population numbers are higher. It costs more money per capita to provide a service to one person than it does per capita to provide that service to 10 people. Please, I say to the government, stop insulting the intelligence of Ontarians with that weak and irrelevant argument that you make.", "Instead of initiatives in the throne speech to reduce spending, Ontarians received multiple new spending commitments that we simply cannot afford if you can’t find the savings to pay for them.", "At the same time, while the Liberal government is being absolutely unrealistic and irresponsible with how they spend our money, they have the nerve to tell Ontarians that the government doesn’t trust them to plan their own finances. So they’re going to dock your paycheques for a pension scheme that won’t help anyone, as our economy continues to spiral downward. According to the Fraser Institute, this latest irresponsible scheme means individuals will pay up to $3,420 more a year in taxes, or nearly $7,000 for a couple who both work. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business states that 86% of its business members—and most of these are small and medium businesses—are opposed to the idea of the new pension scheme, and 53% expect they will have to reduce staffing if it’s implemented. Even the government’s own finance officials have warned that the new payroll tax will cost Ontario tens of thousands of jobs. In fact, the document that we received at committee, Mr. Speaker, says that the scheme will cost 150,000 jobs in the province.", "What that means is that we will have fewer people working and paying taxes, and those lucky enough to still have a job will be paying more for this government’s lack of restraint and failed economic policies. The irony of the Liberals’ enforced savings scheme can’t be overlooked when the reason average Ontarians can’t save for their retirement is that their earnings are being sucked up by skyrocketing hydro bills, HST on everything they buy, higher gasoline bills caused by longer commutes, increasing government fees—all of which are directly caused by the Liberals.", "The throne speech leaves many troubling questions as to the direction Ontario is heading. The only thing we know for certain is that all Ontarians will pay the price. Focusing on private sector job creation and balanced budgets is the only way to protect front-line services for all Ontarians. With a debt this large, Ontario will be in real trouble if we continue in this direction. So today I’m calling upon the Premier to show restraint, to rein in her overspending and to protect the front-line services we all depend on, like health care and education." ],

I’d also like to thank all other elected members of the Legislature as well.", "The Liberals’ throne speech, which was delivered on July 3 by our Lieutenant Governor, signals the same unrealistic and unaffordable plan the Liberal government brought forward before the election. It was very clearly stated that the Wynne government intends to reintroduce the budget originally tabled in this chamber on May 1 and anticipates its speedy passage after its introduction on July 14. Mr. Speaker, I have serious concerns with this so-called budget that I would like to discuss in the short time allotted to me this afternoon.", "The document introduced on May 1 can only very loosely be described as a budget. In fact, it is really a series of disconnected spending promises that do nothing to help Ontario’s economy or help the people of this great province over the long term. Promises contained in the speech signal another era of government living far beyond its means—promises that will threaten our core services and put the things that matter most to Ontarians, like front-line health care and education, in jeopardy. The Liberals’ disregard for our economy also threatens the most vulnerable in our society.", "The Ontario PC caucus knows the importance of living within our means and balancing the budget so we are able to afford services that matter to Ontarians. As well, a balanced budget allows us to safely invest in infrastructure in our hospitals, schools and transit.", "However, instead of taking the necessary steps to ensure financial security, the Liberal government has chosen to spend without any concept of priorities.", "The economic situation in Ontario is dire, Mr. Speaker. It’s far worse than most people realize. Our accumulated debt is approaching $300 billion, while our deficit has increased under the Wynne government to $12.5 billion. Why does this matter? Well, it matters because the third-largest expenditure in government, after health care and education, is the interest cost on money borrowed from international lenders. Ontario currently spends $11 billion per year servicing this debt. This money doesn’t pay anything on principal, just on interest payments. Can you imagine what investments could be made in health care and education and supports for vulnerable people with $11 billion a year? It’s completely irresponsible to continue this unbridled spending.", "As bad as things look now, they’re about to get worse. Last week, Moody’s changed the outlook for Ontario from stable to negative, after the Wynne government promised to reintroduce the original budget that sent us to the polls. The consequence of a credit downgrade is an increase in borrowing costs. We know that a 1% increase in interest rates means an additional $500 million in additional borrowing costs to the province each and every year. We’re also experiencing a 20-year low in interest rates, but they have nowhere to go but up. Although it is doubtful that interest rates will rise to the levels of 18% to 20% that we saw in the late 1980s, there is no doubt that rates will increase in the future. The only question is when and how much.", "Mr. Speaker, the throne speech also outlined the government’s intention to balance the budget by 2017-18 without a realistic plan to get to balance. However, the budget contains billions more in spending that we cannot afford. This of course begs the question: What services will the government have to cut to balance the budget, or will they give up on balancing the budget altogether, which is a far more scary prospect? The Ontario PC caucus believes that balancing the budget will grow the economy and attract businesses to come and expand in Ontario. While the Wynne government has increased the public sector, small and big businesses have picked up and moved from Ontario, and we’ve heard the sad stories over the last few months. We need to create the necessary conditions for these businesses to want to stay. Focusing on private sector job creation will ensure that we can protect our front-line services.", "One of the cornerstones of the Liberal government’s budget, as mentioned in the throne speech, is the proposed Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. This would be phased in over two years, commencing in 2017. Mr. Speaker, the creation of this plan would be a disaster for everyone, from employees to employers and to the government. Several thousand small business owners recently completed a survey by the Ontario branch of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and a full 86% of them did not support the idea of a provincial pension plan.", "It’s estimated that Ontario would add about a half percentage point to its unemployment rate if it implemented the ORPP, which is doubly bad considering Ontario has had higher than the national average rate of unemployment over the last five years plus. It would also mean 171,000 person-years of lost work and a permanent drop in wages. Mr. Wilson mentioned that it would cost a couple, where both people worked, about $7,000 a year. I think this is something that has not been explained to the people of Ontario: that this is going to cost them a significant amount of money. It would be far better for the government to concentrate its efforts on working with the federal government, in looking at enhancements to the CPP at the appropriate time, when our economy is stable. According to Ted Mallett, the vice-president and chief economist of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, “This plan is a whole lot of pain for very little gain.” Mr. Speaker, I would agree and I would urge a sober second look at this plan.", "The throne speech also promises to build a fairer and healthier Ontario, but as the Ontario PC health critic, I can see that the changes brought forward today by the Liberals have done nothing to significantly improve our health care system. Mr. Speaker, health care takes roughly 42% of the provincial budget; however, the throne speech did not make reference to the major changes that must occur for our system to be sustainable in the future for our children and grandchildren. Our population is rapidly aging. Children are now taking care of their aging parents, trying to keep them at home as long as possible. We know we can provide home care far more cost-effectively than a hospital. However, in Ontario we’re simply not ready for our aging population. The community care access centres that currently provide home care services across Ontario need reform. This was mentioned even just this morning by the member from Dufferin–Caledon in one of her questions. Every day in my community office—and I expect all of the members in this chamber hear the same story—I consistently hear of people waiting months for care, with some people not even qualifying for services that they so clearly need. In addition, I hear stories of individuals only getting one bath a week and personal support workers unable to complete all of their work in the time that they have allocated. We’ve also seen CCAC—community care access centre—salaries skyrocket in the past few years, with some CEOs seeing a raise of upwards of 144% in the last few years.", "That is why, in the last session, I asked the Auditor General to review the spending and practices of all community care access centres across Ontario. And I understand that the Auditor General has undertaken that work and that we will expect to see a report being registered and presented in this chamber early next year.", "With more money being directed to front-line care, we will be able to keep seniors in their own homes longer and safely. For those who are unable to remain in their own homes, however, long-term-care homes are the best solution. However, I also consistently hear concerns throughout the province that we do not have a sufficient number of long-term-care placements in many of the communities across Ontario, and even where there are placements, many of them are not up to the standards that individuals and families would expect. In addition, we do not have the proper dementia strategy in Ontario, including safe practices and proper staffing in long-term-care homes. Mr. Speaker, as our population continues to age, we’ve seen dementia and Alzheimer numbers skyrocket. Not only is the staff in our long-term-care homes at risk of violence, but other patients are as well. This government must address the need for proper training and increasing the number of staff to prevent such problems in our long-term-care homes.", "In addition, Mr. Speaker, the throne speech did not address the need for establishing a better solution to the issue of orphan drugs. Last session we saw the courageous little Madi Vanstone battling to receive the wonder drug Kalydeco to fight her cystic fibrosis. While the government hid behind the Pan-Canadian Pricing Alliance, Madi’s friends and family were forced to privately fund-raise in order for Madi to continue to have access to Kalydeco. Without Kalydeco, Madi would have spent months in hospital and would have to wait for a double lung transplant.", "Instead of focusing on the single cost of some of these drugs, we need to look at the overall cost to the health care system. Putting aside quality-of-life issues, hospitalizations in Madi’s case, without Kalydeco, have extraordinary costs associated with them, costs that we simply wouldn’t have if she had access to the appropriate drug in the first place.", "We’ve also seen drugs like Avastin and Esbriet that help improve the quality of life for Ontarians. We need to expand access to these drugs, Mr. Speaker, and we need to develop a solution to the cost so that everybody can get the medications they need when and where they need them.", "The throne speech also failed to mention the need for more nurses in our health care system. Again, Mr. Wilson mentioned the need for more nurses and the fact they are being cut in many parts of Ontario right now. We know that nurses are the essential part of front-line care and, in fact, they are the backbone of our health care system. As our hospitals are consistently at capacity and as our population ages, we know that nurses are uniquely positioned to lessen the stress in our health care system, particularly in hospitals and long-term-care homes. That is why the current government needs to follow through on its promise to hire more nurses in Ontario. We need to see action, not just empty words. In addition, we need to look at expanding scopes of practice for health care professionals. We’ve seen early success with allowing pharmacists to administer flu shots, but there’s much more that pharmacists can do within our health care system, and the government frankly needs to follow through on the promises it made to them several years ago. We need to make sure that other health care professionals are allowed to expand their scopes of practice to their full scope, so that Ontarians will be able to get the care they need faster and closer to home.", "Another issue that is near and dear to me, and which I’ve spoken about many times, is helping people with disabilities in all aspects of their lives, from treatment to housing, to education, to social, recreational and occupational inclusion. So I was glad to see mention made of persons with disabilities in the throne speech and the commitment to make Ontario fully accessible by 2025. However, we must move faster to ensure that we’re able to hit these targets, because people are counting on us.", "We know that the current government has promised $810 million in the current budget to help people with developmental disabilities, but it’s unclear, however, what the plan is for spending this money. For that reason, I would urge the government to take a look at the report that has recently been completed by the Select Committee on Developmental Disabilities. It has yet to be tabled in the Legislature, but I anticipate it will be done within the next short while. It contains many recommendations about the ways that we can help people with developmental disabilities, and I encourage the government to adopt the report once it is tabled so that people across Ontario and their families can get the help, supports and services that they need." ],

So to them, I want to say thank you, and I want to confirm to them that I’ll continue the work of their best interests in this mandate, as I have carried on in the previous three.", "Speaker, my riding is one I’m proud of, and I know all 107 members are very proud of their ridings. Mine happens to be a very unique one. It’s a microcosm, I believe, of the growing and changing Ontario that the Ontario PC Party in this Legislature must seek to represent. Whether it’s urban Ottawa transit, managing explosive suburban growth in Riverside South, Findlay Creek and Barrhaven, or protecting our rural Ontario way of life in North Gower, in Manotick, in Osgoode and Greely, I’ve learned that Nepean–Carleton’s residents are diverse, but they are strong.", "The people I represent come from all over the world. Others, like me, came from different parts of Canada, and some have lived for generations on the family farm. What unites the people of Nepean–Carleton, however, is not just their geographic location within the city of Ottawa. I believe it is what their expectations are of government—expectations, I suspect, that are shared by all Ontarians.", "They pay their taxes, but they expect health care services for their families and schools to be built for their neighbourhoods. They expect us to keep up with roads and bridges and transit. They expect safe streets and, Speaker, they expect clean air and clean water. They also expect their government to live within its means and protect their hard-earned tax dollars that they send to Toronto, and to protect it wisely.", "The Liberal government, on this last score, has failed my constituents. Liberals have been engaged in billion-dollar scandals. They’re allowing our deficit to increase. They are continuing to spend without a plan, and that puts our very core and valued public services at risk.", "It also makes Ontarians question whether they’re getting value for the tax dollars they send to Queen’s Park. On that front, it’s going to be up to the Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus to hold this Liberal government accountable for all Ontarians.", "Good government comes from strong opposition. If there’s one thing that this Progressive Conservative Party has been good at over the past decade, it has been in opposition. I assure the people at home, Progressive Conservatives and otherwise, that we are going to continue to do the job we have been assigned, and that is to hold this Liberal government accountable.", "In seriousness, and I think as some of my colleagues have demonstrated, where we can work with the other parties and where we can make progress by working with others, we will do that. We have seen it before. My colleague from Whitby–Oshawa has done an amazing amount of work on a select committee. We have seen it before with my colleagues Steve Clark and Bob Bailey, who have championed private members’ business with other members of this assembly. Where it will work, and where it’s in the best interests of Ontarians, the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario will continue to work with the other side. I’m proud to have stood with my colleague from Ottawa Centre, now the government House leader, to work on a suicide prevention plan for our city. So where it works, we are going to do it.", "But I assure folks that where the government fails, where they do not advance the interests of the population, we are going to make sure, in the Ontario PC Party, that we point out that there is a better way. That is our job, and we take it seriously. We need a government with policies that do good, not just sound good. It will be the place of the Ontario PC Party to provide that opposition, Speaker.", "That brings to mind three specific areas where I would like to point out to the government where they can do better and where we believe, in the Ontario PC Party, that there is a role for us to play—a meaningful role that will make Ontario a better place.", "First, my colleagues—both our interim leader and of course my colleague from Whitby–Oshawa—talked about needing to live within our means and balancing our budget. When Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s lower our credit rating, as expected, that will have an immediate and negative impact on our schools and on our hospitals. It has been pointed out that servicing the debt and the deficit in Ontario is right now our third-largest spending priority. Every single dollar spent on servicing our debt and deficit is a dollar less for a patient in a hospital and a dollar less for a child in a classroom in this province. It is the third-largest spending priority only behind education and health care. So it will be up to a strong Ontario Progressive Conservative Party to hold this government to account on its ability to pay, its contract negotiations and its use of government assets.", "I’m grateful to interim PC leader Jim Wilson for appointing me as critic of the Treasury Board, whose role it will be to rein in government spending and tackle the debt and the deficit. It is a key role, no doubt, in the government, and I am committed, as the Progressive Conservative opposition critic, to ensuring that this government does get it right, not only for my daughter’s generation but for my daughter’s daughter’s generation.", "The next few years will show whether or not this Liberal government can break their debt dependence. If they cannot, Ontarians will look for a party that they can trust to deliver the services that we all need and do it within a sustainable budget, supported by an expanded economy. I believe that the Ontario PC Party can do that. I believe in our future and I believe that we will rebuild again.", "The Liberal record, however, on the economy has not been strong. Our interim leader has laid out the many reasons why we have had a lacklustre performance in the economy. We have lost, in this province, hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. We have the highest industrial hydro rates in North America. Our debt is higher than all of the other provinces’ combined, Speaker. Our government needs to do better. If they cannot, I’m confident that the Ontario PC Party in four years will be able to rise to that challenge. The best way to protect our core and valued public services is not by digging a deeper hole into debt and deficit and raising people’s taxes; it’s by getting your spending under control with a stronger private sector economy and a balanced provincial budget. It is that simple. It will require hard work and tough choices, but we know the road ahead.", "A second area where the Ontario PC Party can help Ontarians is by keeping a watchful eye on the Liberals’ implementation of a new private sector pension. This plan creates the illusion that future benefits can be achieved without current costs. The Liberal plan will give some people benefits decades from now, but it doesn’t address the real issues of today.", "The new payroll tax that will pay for the plan will cost some people their jobs. We will lose more jobs as a result of the implementation of this plan. And the forced contributions will take money from the pockets of people who are right now struggling to make ends meet. They’re struggling with high hydro bills.", "I’m a soccer mom. The other parents I know are struggling to balance their own budget. They’re seeing their mortgages increase, higher electricity costs and higher gas prices. The cost of groceries is going up. It’s becoming not only more difficult for them to put their kids through soccer and hockey; it’s getting more difficult for them to think about saving for their children’s education down the road.", "It will be the responsibility of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party to criticize these policies. But we have to do it with logic and hard facts. We have to do it for the best interests of all Ontarians. People need to know why it’s a bad plan and what we would do to ensure it’s better. Again, I’m confident that we in the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party will provide that alternative for all Ontarians and in this House.", "This brings me to the third area that needs to be addressed. It’s something that I find to be quite personal. I think it’s something we have to have an honest and thoughtful conversation about in this Legislative Assembly.", "As one of the few MPPs who represents an urban riding with a large rural committee, I have experience working on urban issues, managing explosive suburban growth and standing up for the uniqueness and wholesomeness of rural Ontario. The Liberals and indeed all of us as an assembly need to address the urban-rural divide in Ontario. It’s something I’ve worked hard on in the past eight years. I think it’s something that we have to honestly address in this Assembly.", "On election night, the lines were pretty clearly drawn. While much is made that the Ontario PCs dropped mostly from rural Ontario, the reverse is true for the government. They’ve been almost shut out of rural Ontario. Ontario PCs can play an important role in this dialogue, and the government must also be part of that conversation. Those living in rural Ontario have felt ignored and abandoned by Queen’s Park. In my humble estimation, that has to change. Whether it’s the cancellation of the Slots at Racetracks Program or the negative impacts of wind turbines that are splitting communities and costing the provincial treasury, it will be up to the government to bridge those divides and ease those concerns. Where rural schools are concerned, it means the government must consider the benefits of keeping a rural school open. Sometimes that school is the lifeblood of the community, and that has to be a major consideration.", "As Ontario PCs, we must continue to defend the little guys and bring their voices to Queen’s Park, but we also have a challenge. We have to learn to speak to people in urban Ottawa, in Toronto, in Kitchener and in London. I’m confident we can do that. I’m confident we can help forge a better understanding. We can urge a common ground. But in this area, I firmly believe the government needs the opposition as much as the opposition needs the government, because if we are truly to speak for one Ontario, we have to begin to understand one another. If they have the foresight and they are prepared to admit mistakes have been made, the government will work with us to right the wrongs felt in rural Ontario, starting with changes to the Green Energy Act and fixes to the horse racing industry. To achieve these results in these areas, it means we must be an opposition that engages all Ontarians, not just one that speaks to itself. But that said, it must be true as well for the government—to speak and engage with all Ontarians and not just the ones whom they are most comfortable with. That is the provincial government’s core job. It is their core responsibility. We as Progressive Conservatives will be here to remind them of that." ],

I’m honoured and humbled, and I will continue to serve them in the best way that I possibly can. It’s the only promise I made to them when I was running for election in 2003: that I would serve to the best of my abilities.

She finished by talking about that rural-urban divide. I know that, earlier this year, the Premier spoke in an area in southwestern Ontario and said that there is no urban-rural divide. Or maybe she meant rural-urban divide. But either way, she would be wrong. I think this election clarified that. More and more, we’re seeing a division in this province based on partisan lines. That’s not a good thing. It is clear and it is defined by the map, but it is not a good thing. I’ve heard from so many of my constituents, saying to me, “John, I hope that the government, now that they’ve got their majority back, is not going to ignore us here in rural Ontario.” I’ll take them at their word, because I’ve had many discussions with many members of the cabinet on the other side for the last 11 years. I’ve always believed that they have listened to what we’ve had to say. But there is a feeling out there, folks, ladies and gentlemen of the cabinet of the newly elected, first-ever female elected Premier of the province of Ontario—there is a feeling out there that maybe you don’t care as much as you should about the people in rural Ontario. That’s a message that we keep hearing and I think it’s one that you need to listen to.", "My friend from Peterborough said earlier, in answering a question today, that the most important thing is to listen.

We can’t support a budget that spends that kind of money without any plan to get us out of debt. My friend from Whitby–Oshawa talked about how you have all kinds of words to talk about how you’re going to manage your way out of the fiscal mess, but not one single word about a concrete plan to actually get it done.

They just make no sense.

We’ll say no to no one, if it’s a special interest group that we’re going to need somewhere down the road.” You see, you’ve got this inner conflict over there. You must feel like you’re in an eternal tug-of-war within your own beings. The Premier must lie awake, wondering which side of the bed she should turn to, because she’s being tossed and turned by her own words: “Kill the deficit, spend more money and reduce the debt. Bring in some more socially activist programs—I love them.” She must be just fighting with herself on a moment-by-moment basis.", "But my friend Mr. Wilson said—and, boy, sometimes you’ve got to put these things into perspective, Speaker. It’s scary: For seven years the unemployment in Ontario has been higher than the national average—seven years. Speaker, in the Bible, the Bible that I read—not enough, I’m told by others—they talk of seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine, and to take those seven years of plenty and prepare. Those who did not prepare, they suffered during the seven years of famine. But we now have a crisis of seven years. It is of Biblical proportions. This government is dealing with a situation that they’ve created; it is now of Biblical proportions. Seven years of unemployment higher than the national average, and what do they do about it?

I think you were quoting Jack Mintz earlier today. If we get a downgrade, and that adds even a point—a point—to the interest that Ontario has to pay to service its debt—by the way, folks, the servicing of Ontario’s debt is the third-largest line item in the budget. After health care spending and education spending, the next-biggest line isn’t some ministry. It isn’t some infrastructure program. It isn’t some tangible service that we’re providing for the people of Ontario. No. It’s servicing the debt; it’s the interest that we pay on our debt.

That’s what New Democrats stand up for: a child care system that’s available to our youngest of children and their families, one that has been eroded over the last number of years. But New Democrats are the ones that have been sounding that alarm bell and pushing, even today in question period, to make sure that that child care system is shored up instead of allowed to continue to erode by the Liberals.", "These are the kinds of things, these are the kinds of public services that New Democrats stand up for, day in and day out. Ontarians know that New Democrats fight very hard for them to make sure that their lives are more affordable. We’ve watched year over year as Ontarians have been telling us they simply cannot make ends meet anymore.

Those are the things that New Democrats stand up for and fight for in this Legislature: good jobs for people from one end of this province to the other.", "Ontarians know that New Democrats work hard to find ways to ensure that the government is held accountable and is responsive and responsible to the people of this province. What does that look like? In the last number of years, New Democrats have brought a number of measures forward, some of which have actually been, at least legislatively, put through this House. We haven’t seen the result yet, but things like the Financial Accountability Office. That office still sits dark, but it’s an office that will help to ensure that there is transparency and accountability with the public dollars the people send to Queen’s Park to ensure that their services are being provided.", "But that’s not the end of it, Speaker. New Democrats have also been at the forefront of putting pressure on this government to ensure that there is better hospital oversight, making sure that there is an Ombudsman that can look at what’s happening in our hospital system, long-term care and home care. These are struggles that New Democrats have brought here on behalf of Ontarians because Ontarians know that frankly there is a great deal of investment in the health services that are provided to people in Ontario. But those investments are not always watched over appropriately by a third-party, unbiased body. That’s why Ombudsman oversight in the health care system is something that we have fought for some time to have implemented.", "It’s the same with children’s aid societies and the same with the MUSH sector.

When we see what happened with things like Ornge air ambulance, eHealth and all of these kinds of troubles that Ontarians have watched their government get into, it proves even more that these measures of accountability and these measures of transparency are absolutely required here in Ontario. And now that we’re in a majority government situation, I would put that in fact the need for these measures is greater than ever before.", "But that, Speaker, is the record of New Democrats, and it’s a record that we will be proud to continue with.

Over a decade, the Liberal government has not been accountable and it has not been progressive. Unemployment has remained above the national average since January 2006. It’s not progressive to have a huge unemployment rate, where we have all kinds of people in precarious work situations, where they are being hired by temp agencies that this government has allowed to expand enormously in this province.

The facts show clearly that good jobs have left this province, to be replaced by low-paid service sector jobs. That is not progressive.", "We’ve seen hydro bills that have increased 300% since the Liberals took office, and those hydro bills are projected to increase yet another 42% over the next number of years—the next five years or so.

A woman from Sudbury told me that she’s paying $20,000 a year now for her electricity bill—$20,000 a year—and now that is going to increase by 42%, because the Liberals think it’s progressive to force people to pay hydro rates that they simply can no longer afford. It’s not progressive to do that. It’s not progressive to ignore that people are becoming less and less able to pay their rent, less and less able to keep a roof over their heads because they simply can’t afford the bills at the end of the month.", "You know, it’s interesting. New Democrats have always fought to make sure that people are able to afford a decent living. Whether it’s on affordable housing, whether it’s on social assistance rates, whether it’s on the fact that basic necessities like hydro are becoming out of reach, these are the fights that New Democrats have fought. In fact, the founder of the New Democratic Party fought a fight on affordability. It was the affordability of health care. But that is the tradition of New Democrats, and we will continue to fight on behalf of people when it comes to these issues.", "But you know, Speaker, it is very, very clear that over the last couple of weeks, when the discussion was ongoing during the election campaign, Ontarians clearly did not want to see austerity here in the province of Ontario. They voted against austerity, they voted against job losses and they voted against cuts to front-line services. New Democrats have a duty to every single person in this province to hold this government to account.", "The throne speech that was read on Thursday is really the prelude to what we’re calling a Trojan Horse budget. It’s a Trojan Horse budget, Speaker, because the Liberals have been bending over backwards to convince everybody that it is “progressive,” but you merely need to scratch the surface of that budget to find out that there are some dangerous surprises in store for Ontario.", "We know for sure that that budget will likely be selling off Ontario’s assets. Who knows exactly what that might look like? The government is, of course, not being upfront and clear about exactly what that looks like, but valuable public assets are on the seller’s block by the Liberal government.", "I’ve been elected since 2004. There are members in this caucus who have been elected since before that, and some are newly elected. I think pretty much every couple of years a budget comes along where there’s going to be a massive sell-off of assets. Even Mike Harris wasn’t able to do it, Speaker. And that’s a good thing.", "But I don’t know why the Liberals think that selling off public assets is a progressive move. Speaker, it is not a progressive move. In fact, it’s everything but progressive. Those assets belong to the people of Ontario. Those assets should be delivering for the people of Ontario long into the future. Those assets should be delivering for my son and for his children and for their children. That’s why they’re assets, Speaker, and that’s why the people of Ontario vote against, don’t like, reject, the idea of selling off the furniture to heat the house: because it doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. In that Trojan Horse budget, we see a massive sell-off of valuable public assets.", "We also see that the Liberals are primed to open up new corporate tax loopholes next year. We have said time and time again that that doesn’t make any sense, but it’s more than that, Speaker. It’s that it’s not progressive. It’s not progressive to give the very wealthiest corporations among us even more tax breaks while you’re cutting public services or while you’re implementing an austerity budget. We’re talking billions of dollars, Speaker—billions of dollars—starting next year that are going to be given away in corporate tax loopholes. That’s not progressive. Not in the very least is it progressive.", "But yet again, instead of the Liberals fighting the good fight on these corporate tax loopholes, fighting the good fight with Stephen Harper in Ottawa over these corporate tax loopholes, they’re happy to just quietly sign them away, making sure that the big corporations can write off their HST on things like entertainment and on things like luxury cars, while the rest of us have to worry about what those 100,000 job cuts might look like—because that’s another thing that’s in this budget. Another thing that’s in this budget is a huge gap when it comes to how the government is going to ensure that its promise to balance the books is kept.", "When I asked those questions today in question period, I didn’t get an answer from the Premier. I didn’t get clarification. Don Drummond, the person who the Liberals hired to review all of the services here in Ontario and give them ideas about how to do things differently, said publicly that his firm belief is that that 100,000-job cut that Mr. Hudak used to talk about during the campaign is actually buried in the Liberal budget; that he sees very clearly that those 100,000 jobs are, in fact, going to be cut by the Liberals. I asked the Premier straight up in question period to be clear about it, to come clean with the public. She chose not to. So that tells us clearly that there is something up the sleeve of this government. It actually reinforces our suspicion about this Trojan Horse budget, that in fact it does have serious, serious ramifications for the people of this province.", "I also asked, Mr. Speaker, about the asset sales, and I wasn’t able to get a good response in that regard either. It’s disappointing, because people expect their government to be upfront with them about what their intentions are in the coming years.", "It’s interesting: Another thing that the Liberals brought forward in this budget is something called PRPP pensions. I don’t know whether we’ll see that in the budget that gets tabled on Monday, but I know it was in the budget that was tabled in May. It’s one of the reasons the New Democrats couldn’t support that budget either. PRPPs are Stephen Harper-style pension plans, plain and simple. They’re are Stephen Harper-style pension plans and they are favoured by banks and insurance companies because they’re basically pooled retirement pension plans, kind of like a pooled RSP scheme. The big thing about that pooled RSP scheme, though, is that the banks and insurance companies make a heck of a lot of money on administrative fees. So yes, you can put away your retirement money into one of these pension vehicles, but a lot of that retirement money isn’t going to go to you when you retire; it’s going to have been absorbed by the banks or the insurance companies that offer you that vehicle.", "PRPPs are not a pension plan; they’re a way for the insurance companies and the banks to get more out of the pockets of hard-working Ontarians and Canadians. I think it is shameful that the Liberals have brought this forward—in fact, in the budget that we saw back in May, have accelerated—as their primary option, their primary commitment when it comes to retirement security. A public pension plan—well, they kicked that out to 2017, maybe. But this year, 2014, right away, right now, the Liberals are going to make sure that the banks and insurance companies get their cut of Ontarians’ retirement money. That is not progressive; PRPPs are not progressive. But of course the Liberals will go ahead with that, because that’s in fact what they believe. They believe that the banks and insurance companies should do better. They believe that the big corporations should do better, and that everyday families should have to pay the price. New Democrats disagree with that. We think that is absolutely the wrong way to go. There are interesting thing that weren’t addressed by the Liberals in their throne speech. Of course, they didn’t mention the PRPPs in the throne speech, but they were in the budget that was tabled before, so we’re interested to see if they show up again. I suspect that they will.", "The Liberals didn’t address at all, in their throne speech, the rising electricity rates in this province. I mentioned at the beginning of my speech the numbers of people I’ve spoken to who are absolutely beside themselves with the cost of electricity in this province. The government, the Liberals, have not made a single commitment around trying to stem those increases. In fact, what they’re looking to do is sell off things like OPG, and perhaps sell off Hydro One, to one of their friends, which is Bruce Power. These are things that are quite disturbing, things that I hear are perhaps in the wings. We know that these kinds of sell-offs don’t do well for Ontarians. We know that that simply reduces accountability and transparency and increases the cost, increases the price that Ontarians pay." ],

In fact, one of the things that I neglected to talk about that we did see in that budget and that we will expect in the throne speech is more and more privatization, Speaker. More and more privatization is headed our way. That is not progressive. That’s not a progressive way to go, and yet, somehow the Liberals continue to think that they can label that Trojan Horse budget as progressive.", "Sell-offs in the hydro sector are not going to help us with our hydro rates, and there is nothing in that throne speech to suggest that the government even gets it, that people are struggling to make ends meet, or that people can’t pay their bills, and that one of their biggest bills is their electricity bill. Somehow, I guess that’s something that Liberals are not concerned about at all, but I can tell you that Ontarians are, so New Democrats will work hard to make sure that there is some accountability around what the government does in terms of the electricity system, as well as the rates for households and businesses.", "Auto insurance—not a word on auto insurance in that throne speech, Speaker, but let’s hope that Ontarians who have been burdened with the highest auto insurance rates, regardless of the fact that we have the lowest accident rates in this province, are able to get some relief. We know that the Liberals have dragged their feet thus far. We know that they’ve given the insurance industry massive breaks in terms of policy changes that have allowed them to significantly reduce their claim payouts—close to $2 billion on an annual basis over the last couple of years.", "None of those savings in payouts went to the ratepayers or went to the insurance payers, the people that pay their auto insurance. None of that money went to them. Now the government’s talking about, perhaps, anti-fraud measures, that perhaps those things might contribute to reductions in auto insurance bills. One of the things I think we’ve noticed is that this government isn’t all that good with making sure that commitments to everyday people are kept up with. Commitments to big companies absolutely are, but to everyday people? Definitely not.", "Another thing that was missing from the throne speech: a consumer bill of rights—once again, something for people. Who knows whether or not we will ever see the light of day of a consumer bill of rights?", "The government talked during the campaign about a fee cap or cut, or some kind of way of reining in hospital parking fees. That wasn’t mentioned in the throne speech.", "As I mentioned earlier, the Financial Accountability Officer was absent from the throne speech, although the legislation has passed this House.", "Child care has been suffering enormously. It’s an issue I raised again in question period today. Some 18 communities right now are facing the closure of their child care centres. Today I talked about Sarnia’s Coronation Park Day Nursery. That’s one of the 18 communities that are seeing child care centres about to close, but you know, it’s only one example. There are 17 other communities where this is happening. The Premier got up and said that there have been no cuts to child care. I quickly got an email sent to me when I got back to my office after question period today, from someone who represents people in the child care sector, who said that the Ministry of Education cut child care by 10% in 2013.", "Well, the Premier says there have been no cuts to child care. Child care centres are closing around the province. Oh, and then, lo and behold, a 10% reduction last year to child care. It’s not progressive to pull child care centres out of communities, to leave families high and dry and families with no child care. That’s definitely not a progressive thing.", "They didn’t talk at all about the horse racing industry in their throne speech. We know that horse racing has been devastated. We know that that devastation has rippled through rural Ontario. We know that many, many communities have seen significant job losses because of what this government did in implementing a hasty plan that was drawn up on the back of a napkin, because one of their friends in high places thought that they could make a lot of money by bringing big American casinos into Ontario. All because of that dream of the big American casino, they devastated an entire industry in rural Ontario—shameful. There’s nary a word of it in the throne speech, Speaker—not even one word.", "They didn’t talk about health care wait times for emergencies and for surgeries which I’ve talked about already. I’m pretty sure that their platform talked about bringing down some of these wait times in key areas, but nothing was said about that in the throne speech. Of course, today in question period, New Democrats were holding the government to account on the wait times in the emergency rooms in London.", "The Liberals promised more health links programs—not mentioned; memory clinics for people suffering from Alzheimer’s and dementia—not mentioned; dental programs for kids from low-income households—I think this is a promise that has been recycled 1,000 times—not mentioned; ranked ballot choice for municipal elections, something that was a huge issue leading up to the campaign—not mentioned; nuclear refurbishments—who knows? Who knows whether we’ll ever actually see a business plan for some of those activities that the Liberals intend to undertake?", "Part of the problem, Speaker, is that the promises flow like honey from the Liberals, but the achievements simply don’t reflect the promises. Whether it’s in health care, whether it’s in anti-poverty, whether it’s in jobs or whether it’s just basically meeting the fundamentals that Ontarians expect the government to deliver, the Liberals don’t deliver.", "So we New Democrats are here to do everything we can over the next couple of years to fight for the people of this province and to try to force their government to actually make good on the multiple promises that they make during election campaigns. We’re going to continue to do that work, Speaker. We’re proud to have that important role, and we are going to take that role seriously because the people of this province do deserve a progressive government. They do deserve a government that makes sure that their lives are better. They do deserve a government that’s more focused on the needs of everyday people than on the biggest corporations, the banks and the insurance companies. They don’t have that government right now, but we are going to work really hard to make sure that the people of this province can get some results that make a positive difference in their everyday lives because as I said at the beginning, that’s what New Democrats do.", "People know what we stand up for, people know what we fight for, and people know that we’ll be doing that work over the next couple of years.

When we disagree with the Premier’s decisions, when we disagree with the direction of this government, we will stand up, day in and day out, and put the interests of families and Ontarians first. We will be speaking out against the Liberals’ Trojan Horse budget. We will be holding this government to account for the decisions that it makes because it is New Democrats who will be the progressive voices in this House and across the province, as we always have been, notwithstanding the small moments of time when the Liberals try that little jacket on and then discard it after they form a majority government. Speaker, that’s who New Democrats are, that’s who we always have been, and that’s who we will continue to be. We look forward to that work.", "I am going to be concluding my remarks very briefly, and sharing the rest of the time with Catherine Fife, the MPP for Kitchener–Waterloo.", "I’m proud of the work that New Democrats have been able to provide for the people of this province over the years.

This remains our concern about this document: that you don’t build a province up by letting the most vulnerable fall behind. This is a concern going forward with some of the promises in this piece of legislation and some of the promises that have been made during the election period as well.", "The people of this province gave New Democrats the job, during the 41st Parliament of Ontario, of holding this government to account. It’s going to be a challenging job, and we’re very honest about that, and we’re very straightforward about it. There’s no end to that responsibility, as we’ve seen already. I’m proud to have been re-elected by the people of Kitchener–Waterloo, to be sent back to Queen’s Park and remind this government of their responsibilities and their commitments. I’m proud to stand with the people of the NDP caucus. We are a diverse group, and we’re a strong group, and we have a great leader. We are going to hold this government to account and put the people’s priorities first in this House going forward.", "During the recently completed election campaign, the Liberal government made promise after promise after promise, and for their litany of promises they were re-elected.", "I think it needs to be said that fear can be a very powerful emotion.", "During this throne speech and at nearly every opportunity since then, when a Liberal has found themselves in front of a microphone, they have talked about building Ontario up. In reality, the people of this province have heard a party that is building expectations up. That is what people hear, because there is a track record that this government has to take ownership of. Part of our role in this House is to remind you of that track record so that going forward, people come first.", "If this government’s recent history is a predictor of the future, we’ll see those expectations let down. New Democrats are here to make sure that when the Liberals don’t follow through on their promises, the voices of Ontarians—to whom the Liberals made those promises—aren’t left out while they’re let down.", "This budget was a surprising budget. I agree entirely with our leader: It is not a progressive budget. We still have outstanding concerns with it, as we did two months ago. It wasn’t more than two months ago that there was no end to the list of people who were lining up to call the Liberal budget progressive, but very soon—if it hasn’t already happened—it will only be Liberals who are calling this budget progressive. As our leader has said, you don’t have to look at the Premier’s budget for very long to realize that it is not a progressive budget.", "Even Bloomberg News reported that after year one of the Wynne budget, the Liberals’ own documents show the deepest freeze in two decades. They continued by adding, “A 2017 Liberal government would drop spending by the most per person since former Premier Mike Harris won election on deficit elimination in 1995.”", "If you look at the hospital operating budgets that have been frozen—third straight year of frozen budgets for hospitals, amounting to cuts to hospital services. When you freeze those budgets, those are cuts. The Ontario Nurses’ Association has criticized this decision, stating that they remain deeply concerned by the continuing flatlining of funding of Ontario hospitals. Years of hospital underfunding have cut millions of hours of registered nurses’ care, increasing the number of high-risk patient care situations.", "This is the track record, so this is why we remained so concerned when the budget was presented in May. This government clearly has a revenue problem. I hope that we can all agree with that. The Liberals made promise after promise, and almost immediately after the election they were warned about the effect their plan will have on this province.", "We know that Ontario’s credit rating was downgraded in 2012 by Moody’s. Now two out of the four major rating firms have Ontario at the bottom rung of the AA range. Standard and Poor’s, which is an ironic name, is leaning toward a downgrade with a negative outlook on its rating. Moody’s is leaning toward another downgrade with a negative outlook, announced last week.", "I want to say why this is so important and why we care about that. Moody’s stated that if the government fails to provide clear signals of its ability and willingness to implement the required measures to redress the current fiscal pressures going forward, the credit rating will go down. The Minister of Finance went out into the public at that time and said, “Banks are not freaking out. Don’t worry; they’re not freaking out. Corporations are not freaking out.” But corporations are sitting on billions of dollars and banks, quite honestly, benefit, because they make more money out of the deal.", "But this is why it’s important: As government misses deficit targets, which is happening right now—the Liberal government prior to 2012-13 was on record to reduce their deficit. That is no longer happening. They were making progress; now they are not. When governments start piling on new debt, lenders will charge them more to borrow. This means governments have less money to spend on the priorities, the priorities that they have said are so important, like education, like health care, like infrastructure. We just heard this morning that in the northern part of this province, infrastructure has been neglected for so many years that you are seeing the effects of that neglect on a daily basis.", "But in spite of all of this, which is quite something, the government continues to ignore the possibility of rolling back their corporate tax cuts. This is something that we should be able to work together on. Ontario is one of the lowest-taxed jurisdictions in North America. With the combination of the warnings we are receiving from credit rating agencies and a government that has made many, many election promises, we need to look seriously at eliminating those corporate tax rollbacks. You need the revenue. We are in one of the lowest corporate tax jurisdictions in the country. You will not be able to meet your deficit reduction projections; you just will not. You do not have the money to do it—or, you’re going to break promises.", "We would contend that the government is quite honestly living in a fantasy world where there are no consequences for their decisions. Actually, I recently read an article in the National Post by Scott Stinson. This is on the pension, because this is quite interesting. It’s that now the Liberals, because they’re in a majority setting—it’s a bit of an adjustment for all of us, because I was really enjoying the minority part of it. But Scott Stinson says this about what Liberals can say:", "“Thus, the line in the throne speech about how the proposed Ontario Retirement Pension Plan ‘guarantees financial security for those leaving the workforce’”—guarantees—“even though it does nothing of the sort. (Are we to believe that retirees who have nothing other than CPP benefits and whatever they amass from an ORPP plan that is not set to begin for more than two years are ‘guaranteed’ financial security under” this Liberal plan? He’s basically stating that they can say whatever they want to say.", "We take great exception with that. I feel like sometimes we’re going to be doing the reality check here on this side of the House. New Democrats know that in order to spend on the critical social programs needed in Ontario, we need to be fiscally sound. Because the Liberals don’t seem to understand that point, they presented a plan that threatens service cuts that we haven’t seen since Mike Harris.", "Every time the Liberal government brings up the Mike Harris name, which happens a lot—and quite honestly, on the 407 deal it’s a valid point. But when Bill 115 was brought to this Legislature in September 2012, Mike Harris wouldn’t have gone that far. He would not have squashed collective bargaining rights. He would not have brought in a piece of legislation which would eliminate the rights and voices of those who work in the education sector. For me, this throne speech really is contradictory on so many levels.", "This Liberal government did campaign against austerity. I think that’s a fair thing to say. Yet their own muse—now he’s being called a muse—economist Don Drummond, recently warned Ontario that Kathleen Wynne’s plan will likely result in the elimination of 100,000 public sector workers. The government’s response has been to send out mixed messages. One day, the new chair of the Treasury Board—congratulations—says that the Liberals will hold the line on public sector spending. The next, she says that perhaps there may be raises, if there’s enough money. Maybe it’s not coincidental that the ratings agencies are looking at a downgrade.", "What we are hearing are inconsistencies and contradictory comments with regard to the financial and the fiscal situation of this province, which we all have a shared responsibility to take ownership for. But there has to be this collaboration, this listening that people talk about outside of question period time.", "If we are to reflect back on how we got here in this province, and what the Liberal record is—obviously some big promises are contained in this throne speech, but we need to remember the Liberal track record. Unemployment has been above the national average since January 2006. Ontario is still down 300,000 manufacturing jobs. During the last session, we were quite clear that the Liberals seemed to have just totally written off manufacturing, as if we don’t want to make anything anymore, when we have the research, when we have the innovation and when those jobs need to be created.", "Hydro bills have increased by 300% since the Liberals took office, and they are projected to rise another 42% over the next five years. I just had a letter right here from the Brick Brewing Co. They have informed me that their last bill went up $75,000 over their three facilities. That’s an increase of 20%. We are not going to attract manufacturing, we are not going to attract these jobs, unless we are serious about getting hydro rates under control.", "We brought this issue to the people of this province during the election. We wanted to make sure that there was some streamlining and alignment around the power authorities, those who are regulating our power sources, because there are efficiencies there. If you continue to do the same thing over and over and over again, then you’re just going to get the same result.", "So with regard to Brick, this is a company, actually, that has invested in innovation, that has created good local jobs. Is this how our government shows commitment to an Ontario craft brewer, or to small and medium-sized manufacturers? Energy has to be on the table when you are talking about job creation and when you are talking about strengthening the economy.", "As was mentioned already, the throne speech doesn’t talk about some key issues that we should all be concerned about: the high hydro bills for our households and for businesses. I’ve mentioned the Brick, but they certainly are not alone. The Brick is not alone. There is a reason why southwestern Ontario has listened so closely to some of the voices in our caucus. It’s because they like what they’re hearing, because we have some solutions, and we’re willing to work with them to keep those jobs in those vulnerable areas and because they have not been listened to for so long.", "What else wasn’t in—oh, bullet trains to southwestern Ontario. I can tell you that I would have really appreciated a bullet train this morning from Kitchener–Waterloo to Toronto, because I was hydroplaning between two 18-wheelers in very terrible weather. I was really happy to make it here. At some points, my language was not the best, but I made it here safely. But the bullet trains, or the high-speed trains, which were touted prior to this budget as being a key part of getting southwestern Ontario’s economy back on track, no pun intended, but also leading to greater productivity and safer travel—that’s not in the throne speech. There’s no mention of it there.", "Kitchener city council is holding up construction projects like the Margaret Avenue bridge until it receives direction from this province, so there is a trickle-down effect. When the provincial government doesn’t follow through on promises, especially around infrastructure investment, then it has a trickle-down effect to our municipalities. It’s a natural thing that happens. They’re not going to move forward with that Margaret Avenue bridge until it gets a firm commitment from the provincial government.", "As already mentioned, high auto insurance rates—in the election, you would knock on the door, and you talked about the big issues: the economy and jobs. But it was the issues that affect the people directly. Insurance rates—they feel it. The people of this province understand that there’s a fundamental lack of fairness with regard to auto insurance rates. Despite how well people drive, despite their driving record, those insurance rates continue to go up—even as the government says, “No, they’re going down.” But the lived experience of the people of this province, Mr. Speaker, is contradictory to what you hear from that side of the House.", "The Financial Accountability Officer—and I want to mention this because I was on the hiring committee to get the Financial Accountability Officer in place—" ],

On this side of the House, we couldn’t agree more. The personal support workers, in particular, when you walk the picket line with them, because they’ve been fighting for some pay equity for so long, you will see that they have essentially been holding the home care system together. Meanwhile, CCACs and LHINs get another manager of communications, another public relations manager. There are three intake workers in our local CCAC in Kitchener–Waterloo and they have nine managers.

There was no acknowledgement—and we know this because they had to catch up later on and then they threw the child care into the Ministry of Education, and so you’re continually catching up. But a throne speech and a new budget would be a perfect opportunity to right that wrong. The time is always right to right a wrong, I think, and why not?

It sounds really good, though. It sounds promising. It sounds like perhaps something that can—a promise can be broken, though. I think that we have to remember that on this side of the House. But the promise is to govern from the centre and also with an activist sort of vein, and within the framework, of course, of deficit reduction. I would respectfully suggest that those two concepts are at odds with each other and something has got to give.", "So I think that our priority on this side of the House is to make sure that the people who are those front-line workers—and that’s who we talked about during the election. We talked about the nurses and the personal support workers and the ECEs and the education workers, because there really isn’t an acknowledgement that in the health care sector, for instance, where almost 20% of that funding goes to the top echelons of power and bureaucracy, which continues to grow at the expense and the cost of front-line services. We’re going to fight for those people, because we see them as key people in the health care system and in the education system. I think it has to be said that this government does not have a strong record of ensuring that the people who are actually making a difference in the health care system—the people who are going into someone’s home and helping them get their food and taking care of them, those personal support workers are the people who need to be supported. When we see hospital budgets being frozen for three consecutive years, you have to wonder who’s going to go, because someone’s going to have to go.", "I was actually really pleased: My local hospital just let go, I think, two vice-presidents. I guess the question remains: How many vice-presidents does a hospital need? I think that’s an outstanding question, but I’m sure one of us will come up with a good idea about it.", "As I mentioned, though, this throne speech, Building Expectations Up in Ontario, has some great inconsistencies to it. I was pleased, actually, to hear some of the comments from my colleagues in the PC caucus, but I just want to give you a couple of examples. Many of you know that worker safety in the province of Ontario is an ongoing issue, and I’m going to be working very closely with our critic on this, because two people died in the last two weeks from falling. This is not a new phenomenon. These are tragedies and they are preventable accidents. There is a report on the books that the Liberal government had requested back in 2010, the Dean report, which called for mandatory fall protection training—not just a poster, but some actual training. Yet in the throne speech it says that you are going to follow through on protecting workers while supporting businesses. I’d have to say that this is an ongoing issue and a concern for me.", "You also mentioned that through partnerships with businesses and persons with disabilities, your government will work to increase the number of employment opportunities for Ontarians of all abilities, yet as the AODA standards have rolled out in this province, there have been great inconsistencies. Our own member from Parkdale–High Park had to put a freedom-of-information request to the government to find out how many businesses in this province have failed to meet the compliance standards. Yet here in the speech it says you’re going to follow through on that as well." ],

Because if it is, we know what the future is going to be like. We know that you are going to have to make cuts and you know that we are going to fight those cuts, especially if they affect front-line workers.", "There is a lot of work to be done in this province. The revenue problem that we have in this province stems from job creation, but there are savings, as we’ve indicated, in the health care sector and the energy sector, to find some alignment, to find some savings. Those opportunities do exist, and we are certainly—I have to remain hopeful, because we’re looking at four years. So the tone and the tenor of this budget negotiation will be very interesting, I think. I’m certainly hopeful, and I know, as the caucus is as well, that we can influence the priorities of people in this House going forward. That’s our commitment.

I share her vision of a fair and just Ontario. Perhaps more than anything, and I heard this on the doorstep time and time again, there’s a yearning for public servants who live up to certain standards of good governance, like even-handedness and commitment to a wider public and community good.

This is a quote: “Ontario faces more severe economic and fiscal challenges than most Ontarians realize.” The second part of the quote is, “Unless policy-makers act swiftly and boldly to prevent such an outcome, Ontario faces a series of deficits that would undermine the province’s economic and social future.”", "Those aren’t my words. Those aren’t even from a PC press release either. In fact you can find them posted on the Liberal government’s own website. Those are words from Don Drummond in the report that was commissioned by the Liberals and released in 2012: “Unless policy-makers act swiftly and boldly to prevent such an outcome, Ontario faces a series of deficits that would undermine the province’s economic and social future.”", "Sadly, what we’ve seen since the Drummond report is a series of increasing deficits. If you look back to that year, the deficit was $9.2 billion. It grew to $11.3 billion the following year. It has grown to $12.5 billion this year. This is the wrong direction and a very serious problem in terms of a deteriorating balance sheet that we have now found in Ontario.", "Before the election, I had spoken about some of the real numbers in Ontario and the fact that it has been more than half a year in Ontario since we’ve actually seen any real numbers. I’m including the fall economic statement, and I’m including the budget.", "Let me explain. It was last October when the finance minister failed to deliver the long-range assessment of Ontario’s fiscal environment. He is obligated to do so under the government’s own Fiscal Transparency and Accountability Act. So I asked him in question period on October 21—I’ll read you what I asked him: “Minister, the Fiscal Transparency and Accountability Act ... states, ‘Within two years after each provincial election, the minister shall release a long-range assessment of Ontario’s fiscal environment.’ Minister, you’re two weeks late. When will you be releasing the assessment” that you’re legally required to release?", "That was a question I asked last October. The answer was, “We have a fall economic statement that’s coming out shortly. We’ve produced first-quarter results that achieve our opportunities and that show the success we’ve had to date.” So he said, “They’ll be in the fall economic statement.”", "However, when the fall economic statement came out, there were no medium-term outlook numbers included. In addition, individual ministry expense numbers were not listed for 2016 or 2017, just the total program spending, which magically falls in 2017 to zero and to a balanced budget, but there are no numbers in there to substantiate it. You have a number for revenue and a number for expenses, but you don’t see any line items in there.", "Then in February of 2014, the minister announced he would not be presenting the third-quarter results on February 15, which, once again, the government is required to do under the Fiscal Transparency and Accountability Act.", "This is very discouraging because more than half a year—it’s coming up closer to a year in the fall, of course, since any actual numbers have been presented to this Legislature that will show whether the province is indeed on track to balance the budget by 2017-18.", "As you know, I presented in this Legislature recently items that were disclosed from what were previously confidential documents between the Ministry of Finance and the Premier, and the Ministry of Finance and cabinet. I’ll again read a couple of sentences which tell us why we don’t have all of those numbers to show how they would balance.", "For 2014-15 and 2015-16, the government is “not on track to meet ... budget deficit targets.” This is provided by the Ministry of Finance’s internal document of March 2013.", "Shortly after this document was given to the government, the Ministry of Finance came out with a news release that said that the government is on track to meet the steadily declining deficit targets outlined in the 2012 budget, to achieve a balance by 2017-18. So while the government was told by their own Ministry of Finance one thing—that they’re not on track to balance—they came out and told the public the complete opposite of that—that they indeed are on track—by steadily declining deficits. But the deficits aren’t declining. They’re growing, from $9.2 billion to $11.3 billion to $12.5 billion.", "We will continue to bring these items to light, because these are so important. When you see the financial news that is out there about Ontario, you’ll begin to understand why these various rating agencies are coming up with these negative announcements for Ontario. They don’t have the numbers from the government either, and the documents that they do have show that we have increasing deficits, and they show the trouble that we’re in.", "So when you see a headline in the Financial Post on June 13, the day after the election—now, all of the rating agencies were respectful and during the writ period never made a comment. I think that was fair of them. It’s our job as the opposition to bring those facts to light, which we attempted to do, but on the very day after, on June 13, in the Financial Post, there’s a headline stating “BlackRock Says It’s on ‘High Alert’ for Ontario Debt Downgrade after Wynne Victory.”", "I’ll read you the sentence from the Post: “‘We’re on high alert that S&P will downgrade Ontario,’ said Aubrey Basdeo, head of Canadian fixed-income in Toronto at BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest money manager.” Speaking of the Premier: “‘She’s front-loading the deficit or the total debt in anticipation future years will benefit from stronger growth. They’re just looking at the raw numbers and they’re seeing a deteriorating financial balance sheet.’”", "So because they see the deficit increasing, and they see no evidence of balancing a budget, BlackRock said they’re on high alert for Ontario. This was the day after the election. They finally ended with, “‘It’s going to be a challenge for the province to hit their out-year spending.’” The province will need to issue more bonds as a result, and what does that mean? That means borrowing will cost more money. We need to borrow more. Our interest rates already, as you’ve heard from many speakers, are the third-highest.", "So what you saw this week, as well, was Moody’s, another credit rating agency, coming out with a downgrade on their outlook. Now, that’s very serious. The day after the budget, May 2, Moody’s came out with a credit watch. During the election period, they did not break their silence. BlackRock came out immediately, and now Moody’s is out with a downgrade of the outlook. Speaker, I will say to you that that is foreshadowing the S&P downgrade that will certainly come the week of July 14 or 21, once we get to this point.", "Again, Speaker, I bring this up because those who are in the know fully understand that there is no balanced budget coming from this government. We saw it in the throne speech. We see it in the budget that’s about to be re-presented. Norman Levine of Portfolio Management said it best when he said, “They have not articulated in any way, shape or form how they would get there.” I think he says it best.", "Speaker, there is no mention of the cuts that will be coming from this government, but I can tell you, when I speak on behalf of the 40 nurses and health care professionals who were terminated in North Bay, and 290 who were terminated province-wide during the election—it was announced that 60 beds in my hometown of North Bay in the brand new hospital would be closing. Some 34 more people lost their jobs. Last week, eight teachers were laid off at the Near North District School Board. All of these things are a result of not being able to balance the budget. That’s why we saw 39 fewer days of cataract surgeries last year. That’s why we saw diabetes testing strips cancelled. That’s why we saw physiotherapy for seniors being cancelled. It’s because there is no balanced budget, and there is no balanced budget in the forecast.", "I’ve heard others here talk about the gas plant. I do want to speak very briefly about it—only in the context of the throne speech, Speaker; I’m not about to relive that battle today. In the throne speech, we heard the Premier’s words, through the Lieutenant Governor, that they’re looking forward to the final report. Well, I take that as a signal that there will be no more hearings. Certainly with a majority government, we’re never going to see another document. We fought so hard through a lot of tremendous battles to get our hands on, first, the 36,000 documents, followed by 20,000 documents, which grew up to 300,000, where we learned that it wasn’t $40 million, it was $1.1 billion. But all those documents that we got, especially in estimates as well—I fear that those days are over.", "Estimates taught us through the documents that we received that there is no plan to balance the budget. The Ontario Northland is another one. When the government announced they were having a fire sale of Ontario Northland because they would save $265 million, I stood up that day and said there’s not a chance you’re going to have any savings. It took almost a year—in fact, it took a little over a year—to prove that there were no savings. We called in the Auditor General. The NDP joined me in the vote. We won the vote. We called the Auditor General in. We looked at the documents that were previously confidential and saw that it would cost—cost—$820 million to sell Ontario Northland, not save $265 million.", "So when I heard the throne speech that said “bring the final report for the gas plant hearings,” I was saddened by that part. That was code for, “There are no more documents. You’re never going to see what really are the underpinnings.”", "That brings to mind MaRS, when the scandal that broke during the campaign—we learned that the purchase of the MaRS building, the bailout of a private American real estate developer, may cost the taxpayers $500 million. There was no mention in the throne speech, but they need to tell us how much this is going to cost.", "During the campaign, we did learn that there would be a $45.7-million shortfall in operating costs because MaRS would be running in the red. We do know that there was $317 million in payments. We did learn that the government planned to break leases throughout Toronto and move people into there, government offices into there. We did learn that the $106 million would be spent in fit-up costs and the province would be paying $11 million a year for 40 years—that’s $440 million—in amortization costs above and beyond the $317-million bailout.", "But what we learned afterwards from whistle-blowers—we haven’t heard much about this—was that there was a $5.2-million swap breakage cost and consulting fees to the government’s consulting for those 30 days of work. We also learned there is a debt service guarantee that was activated. We want to know to whom. How much is the government on the hook for? We also learned that interest rates on overdue rent were payable. Again, from whom and how much?", "These are the kinds of things I would have hoped we would hear more details about. Instead, we heard sort of loose guidelines about an ORPP, an Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. Again, we did learn throughout the campaign that 86% of small businesses are opposed to this; 53% say they will reduce staff. But that shouldn’t come as a surprise to the government, because one of those formerly confidential documents that we received was from the Ministry of Finance. Let me quote from the Ministry of Finance documents talking about this payroll tax. What you will receive as a result of it are “lower business investment, relocation of business to other jurisdictions, reduced work effort, out-migration of people.”", "This is your own Ministry of Finance telling you that if you go ahead with this ORPP, this Ontario Registered Pension Plan, you will lose 150,000 jobs in the province of Ontario. That’s the number from your finance ministry if you match the CPP. To put it in their exact wording, you will lose 18,000 jobs in Ontario for every $2 billion you take out of the system in this tax. So that’s why your own ministry said to the Premier, in a confidential memo, that you’re going to have lower business investment, relocation of business, reduced work effort and lost jobs by the tens of thousands. That is your own ministry’s advice to you in saying, “Don’t do this; this is very harmful to Ontario.”", "I do want to conclude with a bright light, if I can call it that. This is the billion-dollar commitment to the Ring of Fire. Now sadly, there’s no time frame to the Ring of Fire. There was an announcement about forming the development company." ],

Spending is going up, revenue is down. The Bank of Canada told us that we will not make our revenue targets in Ontario for 2013-14 and next year. Speaker, that’s very concerning to us because the throne speech—and the budget that we have coming next week—as they’ve told us, it will be the same budget—has $5.7 billion in additional spending. That is worrisome because we have a $12.5-billion deficit this year, and this additional $5.7 billion in spending, that’s not just this year’s spending. This is permanent. This is baked into every budget going forward; that’s what’s so concerning. As I think the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke called it earlier—a dichotomy.", "We have great aspiration to provide all of these services and no plan to balance the budget. An offer to balance the budget, an aspiration to balance the budget, but both go in diametrically opposed directions. So you’ve got the Bank of Canada telling us that our revenue is going down in Ontario, and the Premier and the finance minister telling us that spending is going up. They’re both going the wrong way. The hole in the middle is getting larger and people are getting more concerned. As you’ve heard others say, interest is our third-largest ministry, if it was a ministry, and, Speaker, that’s where we need to draw some attention.

That is, we understood when we set up Ontario Hydro that it was an economic development tool.

If you take a look at what Mr. Drummond said the other day on TVO with your good friend Mr. Paikin, in fact, if the government is going to reach the targets that it puts forward in its own budget, they’re going to have to find a way to cut a number of jobs, and he suggested that that number is probably close to 100,000.", "It’s going to be interesting to see, Mr. Speaker—as we look at the clock ticking down—that in fact, the government is going to be in an interesting situation come a year from now. Will they still be able to say to Ontarians, “We’re the progressives of this province”? Or probably, more likely, will they be saying, “In fact, we hate to admit it, but really, we’re the guys who ran from the left but are actually governing from the right”?", "With that, I’ll save the rest of the time for the next time that we speak." ],

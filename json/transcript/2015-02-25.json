We’re very, very proud of our history in Essex county, and many would know the incredible variety of agricultural products that come out of the county. Of course, we would all know Leamington and Kingsville, home of the largest amount of vegetables grown under glass in our greenhouse industry. We’re very proud; it’s a very important economic generator for our region, one that continues to innovate and continues to grow—no pun intended. They certainly are a large portion of our regional economy and provide a tangible economic benefit to our area.", "Interjection." ],

I’ll get into that, for my friend from Windsor–Tecumseh, who also knows the importance of agricultural production.", "Today we’re talking about expanding this act. G40 expands the Crop Insurance Act to cover other products. Currently, the Crop Insurance Act covers about 90 products in the province, including grains, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, forage—hay—honey and tobacco, but it does not cover livestock or maple products. That’s what we’re talking about today: expanding that coverage to those segments of agriculture, which are, of course, important.", "We know that we have a good base of livestock production and a footprint in the province, and it’s growing as well. As the recognition of locally grown food and the need and demand for locally grown food increases, these types of industries are going to also increase.", "That isn’t to say that they aren’t facing, and won’t face, tremendous challenges, as we’ve seen in other jurisdictions. I would point to Alberta, which several years ago faced a massive BSE crisis that really decimated their industry. We need to be cognizant of that, and I think this is what this bill does. It is an enabling piece of legislation that allows the government to ultimately bring those types of products into the fold under the Agriculture Insurance Act, and provide those producers with some coverage—some support and protection—should things go awry.", "We know there are challenges, not only through the BSE-type viruses or illnesses, but also, of course, environmental challenges that farmers face each and every day and each and every season that are outside of their control. That’s why these types of mechanisms are incredibly important. I would say they are vitally important, not only to our economy but, even more importantly, to our national security. That is how absolutely important this industry is. We’re talking about food security. We’re talking about food sovereignty and the ability to rely on your own production, domestic production; and food safety, to be able to ensure that the products we all eat each and every day are safe and produced with a good amount of oversight, protection and safety.", "We know that farmers do that. We know that they put the highest standards on every one of the products that leaves the farm gate. However, we have to remain diligent in terms of ensuring that those regulations are not so burdensome that it puts them out of business, but also balances the need and the demand for food awareness, food safety and, really, origin: Where is it coming from?", "I would suspect, and I would argue, that if you canvass the majority of Canadians and certainly Ontarians, we’re more likely, more apt, to choose a product that is grown and made here in Ontario rather than one that is made somewhere else in the world, because we know our farmers—they’re our friends; they’re our neighbours—and we know the value they place on their products and their industry.", "I’m sure that members of the House have heard the phrase, “If you ate today, thank a farmer.” And of course, if you are a farmer, thank you, because we know that farmers feed cities; farmers feed communities. They are not simply that; they provide a vital component to our rural identity, something that has increasingly been diminished under this Liberal government, frankly.", "I live in rural Ontario. I drive the county roads. When I look down the concessions and see a large acreage, a large farm that’s been owned from generation to generation, and I know the challenges those farmers are facing and I know they are potentially deciding to maybe sell the farm and I also know that their children aren’t likely to take it up because of those challenges, because of the burdens that have been placed on farmers, that puts our industry in peril and puts our food security in peril—back to the nature of food sovereignty and our ability to produce our own food.", "Imagine if we lost the ability, not only to produce our own food but to control it, and the knowledge that it takes to produce food. It’s incredible. Farmers are no longer simply planting seed and waiting for something to pop out of the ground. If you’re a farmer, you are an environmentalist, because you have to be a steward of your land; you have to recognize the challenges in keeping up your land. You are an engineer, because you’ve got to fix tractors—you’re a mechanic. You’re an economist, because you’ve got to watch the markets. You are a whole host of professions and knowledge that it takes to be a farmer. Imagine what type of position we would be in, as a country and certainly as a province, if we lost that knowledge base. That’s why I would submit that agricultural production in the province is our number one important industry, not only because of the economic value, but because of that security value.", "There’s so much more we could be doing, so much more that we have to do, so much more that farmers and the Ontario Federation of Agriculture and the National Farmers Union have told us we could be doing, one of which is developing a provincial agriculture strategy, not simply an ad hoc way or an ad hoc approach to how we deal with agriculture. It’s a piecemeal approach. When things go bad, we try to find some money here and try to develop a program here to be able to buffer that production. It can’t work. It’s not sustainable, and it doesn’t give the confidence to the industry that we take agriculture seriously.", "Imagine if we had, in this province, an actual provincial agriculture strategy, something that would address the rising cost of hydro, the skyrocketing cost of hydro that many of our producers face. Imagine if we addressed that issue for them, so that they could feel confident in going forward and growing forward.", "Imagine if we reviewed the barriers to trade, being access to market but also the imbalance that we face under some of our trading agreements that allow foreign food to be dumped into Ontario, into Canada. Imagine if we said, “Whoa, we’re not going to do that any longer. We’re going to create a level playing field for our agricultural producers,” because we know their costs for inputs are incredibly higher than some other regions of the planet. Imagine if we actually took agricultural production seriously.", "Investing in access to natural gas: There is a consensus throughout the agriculture industry in Ontario that they need more access to natural gas and the ability to use it, given that it is certainly more affordable these days than hydro.", "Speaker, Rural Ontario revolves around agricultural production and all of the effects of this government when it comes to rural Ontario. I’m talking about the closure of rural and small schools, the closure of rural hospitals; I would point to the OB unit being threatened to be closed at Leamington general hospital. Those affect the decision-making process of our farmers, whether they continue to produce in those regions or whether they close up shop completely and maybe sell their land and their business to a foreign entity. Again, that points back to a risk of our national sovereignty in that we lose that domestic production.", "Imagine if we had a provincial agriculture program that actually had procurement policy built into it, that said, “We are the government of Ontario. We have the largest buying capacity in the province.” Should we not identify locally provincially grown and produced food and use it in our provincial entities—schools, hospitals, prisons? Imagine we had a threshold, let’s say, of 20% where we mandated that we bought Ontario-grown food. We all hear the catchphrases; we all hear “Good things grown in Ontario.” But that’s really simply all it is: a really nice commercial. We’re not speaking those words. We are not working towards actually supporting and enhancing and protecting agricultural production.", "This, again, is enabling legislation. It calls for the government to be able to bring other products—livestock products and maple syrup, I would imagine—into the fold under the provisions of the Crop Insurance Act. It actually changes the name of the Crop Insurance Act to the Agricultural Products Insurance Act—a subtle change. I guess it’s a little bit more broad in its scope, and I think that’s a good thing. It definitely recognizes the importance of all of our products that are made in Ontario related to agriculture.", "However, it does not tie any dollar figure to the insurance. Currently, I think it’s roughly $100 million that is within the envelope of the Crop Insurance Act. So let’s say, Speaker, that grains and oilseeds have a terrible year across the province, your soy and your canola and your corn. Imagine that they have a terrible drought year, let’s say due to the effects of climate change, because that is a reality that farmers know all too well, that the drastic change in weather and the uncertainty and volatility of weather is affecting their crop production and their yields. Let’s say that happens, as it did in 2006, as it did in 2005, and farmers are not able to buffer that. Just those two entities alone, the grains and oilseeds commodities sector, would eat up the $100 million. So bring in other products that may be facing the same challenges and your bank is empty. At a time when we know that OMAFRA’s budget is being cut by, I believe, 6% every year—I guess this was a mandate under the former Minister of Agriculture, who also happened to be at the time the Premier of the province. She challenged farmers to create 120,000 new jobs and double the sector’s growth rate by 2020, at the same time cutting OMAFRA’s budget by 6%.", "I don’t know who the economist is who is giving the government that type of advice, but it doesn’t make sense to us here in the NDP. We would say that if you’re going to challenge an industry to grow and to innovate, as they do currently, then you’ve got to be there in terms of support. You should actually make a commitment and you should identify the value in protecting agriculture. They haven’t done that. That’s a terrible signal. “We want you to grow, but we’re going to cut back. We’re going to cut back on local offices in areas like Essex,” where we had historically, for decades and decades, a wonderful OMAFRA office that serviced local farmers. That doesn’t exist anymore. Farmers have to access their support through OMAFRA from who knows where, but definitely outside of Essex county. That goes against how rural Ontario operates, Speaker.", "Obviously, the government doesn’t really understand rural Ontario. We like to talk to people, we like to sit down and understand and work out the nuances, and it’s hard to do that over the Internet in a form letter or a form application. We need to know—there are, again, specific nuances and idiosyncrasies of each and every farm that don’t simply apply. They aren’t recognizing that in their slashing of the OMAFRA budget, but yet they’re challenging farmers to grow more—and they will.", "Farmers have always been innovative. They do so each and every day. As I said, they’re not only farmers but they are engineers. They’re data collectors, they are on the cutting edge of science; they understand GPS, they understand best practices and they implement them into their operations. However, they’re not being led, of course, by this government. They’re taking it on their own initiative to improve their product, improve their quality and safety, and I know that they will continue to do that and play a vital part.", "It’s a given that New Democrats support this provision to bring in livestock under the fold of the Crop Insurance Act, to ensure that should they face any challenges, we protect that industry; protect the nature and the important history of the industry. However, there is so much more that can be done in the realm of agriculture.", "Imagine, Speaker—it’s a government that touts the importance of rural Ontario. They say a lot of great things, but to really show some initiative, I would throw that challenge right back at the Premier, right back at the Minister of Rural Affairs: Create a standing committee on agriculture. If you actually think that farming and agricultural production in this province is as important, as I do, as we do as New Democrats, create a standing committee so that we can discuss all of these issues that I brought up today so that we can continue—we can show our agricultural producers out there that we actually care, we take them seriously and we’re going to have a specific forum for them to voice their concerns, for them to play a role in discussing legislative initiatives. Why not do that? It’s a simple mechanism. It wouldn’t cost that much money but would actually give voice to these concerns, not in the ad hoc way in which this government treats our farmers: piecemeal; here and there, when things happen. No, take it seriously. Create a standing committee and make it happen.", "Also stop attacking rural Ontario for the sake of other areas of the province. You’re pitting rural Ontario against one another when it comes to a whole host of issues. You don’t understand the idiosyncrasies of rural Ontario. The need for small schools: Yes, they may not be up to the same capacity as some urban areas but they are the heartbeat of those communities. They are what families and generations have relied on. The school might not look that pretty. It might not have a nice sheen on it—as the government likes to do and cut ribbons—but sometimes they’re historic. They are places in which families have gathered for generations to play a role in their kids’ education, to gather to support and celebrate their communities, and you’re tearing that out of rural Ontario. It’s a shame.", "Then we close OB units; we close obstetrics and gynecology units in small rural hospitals, as they are in Leamington. What type of a signal does that send? There’s no longer an area for to you have your child in this geographic location, so would you not think that that’s going to affect the enrolment of small rural schools? They’re directly connected. But the government doesn’t see that because, again, they don’t understand the needs—they don’t understand rural Ontario, point final.", "But I would say that New Democrats do. That’s why we certainly support our farmers. We look forward to working with them in concert, and we appreciate and value what they do for us each and every day. Again, when I drive down those rural roads in my beautiful riding of Essex county and I look at these big plots of land, I don’t just see a commodity being grown. I see a small business. I see a family. I see a hub of community and connectivity. We know. We see the names, the namesakes on the barns, a proud history of agricultural production. That, without the right attention and without the right priority, could be lost. And it is at threat of being lost.", "I hope the government understands the important nature of agricultural production. I hope they start to take it seriously, stop doing the ad hoc thing and actually value and implement legislation that adds value and supports the vital nature of agricultural production in this province.", "Speaker, thank you very much and I thank the members for their attention." ],

It helps level the playing field for Ontario farmers with all other farmers across the country and it’s an important piece of legislation. I want to thank the member for his commitment and support for the bill.", "The reality is that he supports it and he knows that the government is doing the right thing for farmers in Ontario, but then he turns around like so many rural members—they start with the praise and they praise the farmers but they don’t see the reciprocal relationships. Yes, farmers feed cities and we’re very, very proud and very, very supportive of that in urban Ontario, in the urban communities. But over 50% of food processing, Mr. Speaker, happens in urban ridings. And while farmers should be thanked by the people in the cities and the communities who eat the great food that they produce, at the same time farmers should be thanking cities because cities enrich farmers all the time. Being consumers in the field and understanding the importance of what the consumer wants is an extraordinarily important part of that reciprocal relationship.", "I also want to talk to the fact that this government understands very well how important the farming community is in Ontario. One out of every eight jobs in Ontario is in agricultural production and processing, and so it’s an extraordinarily important sector. We are providing stability.

I will give you an example from Nickel Belt. We will all remember when the government, in its wisdom, decided to cancel the Slots at Racetracks Program. We have Sudbury Downs in Nickel Belt; we have a racetrack. We don’t anymore. What do you figure happened to all of the hay farmers who used to grow their crops to feed those horses? The horses are gone. They have gone down south because every racetrack down south all got a deal, but the one and only racetrack in the north never got a deal. We don’t have horse racing anymore. We don’t have horses anymore, but we certainly do have a lot of farmers who are going through really tough times, because to change from growing the special hay that you need to feed a racehorse to growing anything else in Nickel Belt—we are not talking Niagara Peninsula here, we’re talking Nickel Belt; it is not easy.", "Hay had been growing in Nickel Belt and had been feeding the horses and had been sustaining the farmers. Because they had that cash crop coming in they could buy a trailer, buy a new tractor, invest in their barns, make sure that they were able to grow other crops that were sold throughout the farmers’ market in my riding and in Sudbury, but all of this was taken away. A lot of my farmers don’t farm anymore. A lot of tractors are up for sale and a lot of families are having a tough time. It should have never gone down this way, Speaker. It should have never gone that way." ],

Not very many people may be aware of this fact, but the reality is that we are one of the largest agriculture jurisdictions in Canada, apart from our very heavy manufacturing and other industrial base in this province. That’s why our government is very keen to support our agriculture and the agri-food industry in Canada, in Ontario. For that reason we are expanding the insurance coverage for our agricultural industries in this province.", "This act, the Agriculture Insurance Act, 2014, is going to provide that kind of coverage—which our farmers deserve, to have that kind of coverage. It will include so many crops; I may just list of some of them. It includes the areas of fresh vegetables, fruits, honey, processing vegetables, grains and oilseeds, tobacco and specialty crops. This is what this act is going to do. It’s based on a premium paid by the farmers, paid by the Ontario government, as well as our federal partners.", "I think this is a good act, and I support this. I urge all my colleagues in this House to support this act because we need to support our farmers to make sure that they have peace of mind when they put their crops, the seeds, in the ground.

So this is a far better system for farmers, a far better system for government, a far better system for all of us, because it’s far more predictive, far more controllable.", "By giving more producers the opportunity to access production insurance, we’ll help them to better manage their risk and encourage greater innovation, job creation and growth in the agri-food sector.", "I can certainly say that from what I’ve learned of farmers throughout the Holland Marsh area and across Ontario, and even in my ancestral home of King township, farmers are among the most entrepreneurial people we have in this province, and if there is a way of doing something better and less expensively, they have found the way and are oftentimes the leaders in implementing that.", "A lot of that, I think, goes back to the very good education system we have.

Some of the folks who I met had lost wedding photos, had lost mementos, had lost things of tremendous sentimental value in addition to incurring tremendous financial costs.

Currently, when participants in the agri-food sector are hit hard, they have to come to the government for ad hoc support. One of the things that I think about a lot is how we can manage our taxpayers’ money as effectively as possible, and insurance programs are an excellent way of doing that because the contributions to that program are shared. They’re shared by the producers, who are the investors, but they’re also shared by the provincial and federal governments.", "When I think about this, this is a really important way of making sure that our provincial government has some stability, that we’re prepared for some of the disasters that might strike our agri-food producers, but it also makes sure that the cost of this is spread evenly and predictably across those participants. That’s a really important element. It’s not just about managing risk. It’s not just about protecting people’s livelihoods, but it’s also about sharing costs and managing taxpayer dollars responsibly.", "The other thing I would say is that this amendment that we’re speaking to today doesn’t have an immediate financial impact. This just allows us to extend what is already an important and successful program to more producers cross Ontario.", "We have an agri-food sector that’s critical to our economy.

Agriculture in our area is probably the largest agricultural sector in eastern Ontario, and it’s quite different than the crops and produce in western Ontario.

No question, we need to go further. We’ve seen some major disasters when it came to some of our products that aren’t covered. So it’s certainly time to move on.

The Kemptville College example: a major educational institution in my region, certainly the only English-language institution in eastern Ontario, closed without any consultation, without any notice. There’s some sugar-coating that we’re going to put a committee together to look at it. Over the years I had five brothers who went to that college; and nephews.

They tend to go to the institutions that are close. It allows them to be home on the weekends. They didn’t travel to almost Windsor, to go to Sarnia; or to Ridgetown, to go to the college up there. You can imagine it’s just impractical even to get home on the weekends. It’s barely a full day’s drive; you’re lucky to get through Toronto.", "If they really had an initiative to look after agriculture, decisions like that wouldn’t be made. Certainly, they would have planned ahead; they just wouldn’t be closed. We’re looking at a community that raised a couple of million dollars locally to build the new dairy farm research facility just a couple of years ago—money that was gathered from the community that could have been put into the hospital. Now it’s in an empty shell, the cows moved to Guelph, the quota with it, the robots. It’s just not an efficient way of running anything, let alone the agriculture industry. It really speaks spades for just what the interest is with this.", "Agriculture is a tough business. I look at last year: In our area we had, of course, a cold winter. At that time we hadn’t experienced many cold winters so we complained about it and we’re hit again, of course, this year with one. It led to a late spring, a wet spring, a lot of concern about getting crops in. We were lucky, we got three or four days. The farms now are fairly well set up so that when they get a break they can get a lot of crops in. So we got our crops in a little bit late, but relatively—at that time it seemed okay, but then we ran into a fairly wet summer. Then what seemed to be really horrific at the time, we had an extremely early frost—not just a mild frost but an extremely heavy frost—just before the plowing match. I know my brother was quite upset with it because he thought that was it, the corn wasn’t—but it came along and, actually, we had a fairly good crop in eastern Ontario.", "It was different in western Ontario; they didn’t get that break in the springtime. They didn’t get the crops in until much later. They ran into a cool summer; they didn’t get the frost but the crops didn’t mature. So, really, they had a much more serious problem out there.", "In eastern Ontario the wet summer—we had a huge mould problem. Soybeans—interesting because you could really pick out the fields and the varieties that were not a problem before, but all of a sudden losses—one of our neighbours, one stretch of land was 100% lost to the mould. So a lot of issues can happen there.", "You get something in early—the wet summer, warm summer, mould. Then you’ve got to deal with crop prices. Farming, it’s a science; it really depends on a lot of factors. Then you have to worry about our neighbours. What’s the climate down there? Is there going to be a half-decent price at the end of the year, if they have a good crop in the States? They certainly have a lot more favourable climate, generally. So it’s not an easy thing.", "The insurance really is important. If we’re going to expect that we can survive—there are lots of years when North America depends on Canadian supply. If we don’t protect that, as you can imagine, if we don’t have the food and the Americans don’t have it, where are we going to go for that? A lot of countries in the world depend on Canadian food, so the insurance does a lot more than just protect our farmers. It’s really protecting our livelihood up here.", "We’re looking at the enabling legislation here. We’re looking to see just what it covers. We’re hoping that there is sufficient consultation as we go around, getting it right. There are a lot of things to deal with here.", "We talked about the PED virus going around through the pig industry just a couple of years ago.", "Part of our strategy has to be working with our markets, which are the Americans. They’re doing a lot of research. We should leverage that. We should work with them and find out the best practices, because if we don’t mirror a lot of their best practices, they won’t have the confidence to buy our food. Not only will it help us get more for the money we spend on research, but it actually does a lot for the market down the road.", "Hopefully, since the markets are so integrated, with product back and forth—I think Toby mentioned that we ship our product down. They go down to the same markets that the American hogs are going to. It seemed like the virus started down there. The trucks come back and it’s carried back. The same could happen in reverse.", "We have to make sure that the technology and the research we do looks at that integrated market. At the same time, they have been interested in making sure it works for us. We want to make sure that that’s actually put in there.", "We’re looking now at hog herds in Ontario. They’re about 30% less than they were just a short time ago.", "It’s the same thing with BSE. In our area, BSE—we don’t have as big a beef industry, but it really hurt our dairy industry. I remember young calves being shipped off to market, and it used to be income that supplemented the dairy. It actually cost money. By the time you paid for the transportation and the auctioneering, you actually had a bill to send small calves to market. It just shows some of the issues that—how integrated the different markets are. I think it’s important that if we’re going to have an impact, we have to do that. We have to look at the overall market and the overall areas.", "Certainly, this government—I look at our area in eastern Ontario, and rural Ontario, where I grew up, and a lot of things, the way it used to be, and some of the programs that they’ve brought out, and I don’t think they’ve really considered what happens in rural Ontario.", "I know I just have a minute, so I’ll just go on to this.", "I was at a ROMA conference just after this government took over.

We built a small building, and we put in a well, a flush toilet and a sink to wash your hands. Now you’re telling us we have to lock the door and put the Johnny-on-the-spot back. Is that what you’re telling us?”", "The then Minister of Agriculture—she was also the Minister of the Environment—stood up and said, “That’s exactly what I’m telling you, because there’s nobody going to die on my watch.”", "So you think back. Okay, you’ve taken a little bit of research and a little bit of knowledge, but what happens when you don’t wash your hands? Health has come to the point where we know that people need to—proper hygiene is important. I guess we’ve got grass that we can rub our hands on. But that’s the logic: Rural Ontario is a little bit different. We don’t have piped water everywhere. We can be miles away from the nearest water supply. There are ways around that. But they were forced to shut the building.", "We’ve had the same issues in our area. We live there on well water. We survive very well. There are issues that you have to look at, but it’s manageable.

We know that a safe, inclusive and accepting school environment is essential for students to succeed in the classroom and beyond, and it is the responsibility of everyone in our schools and local communities to promote respectful and caring relationships that support the cognitive, emotional, social and physical development of our children and students.", "That is why today thousands of students and educators across Ontario and across Canada will be recognizing Pink Shirt Day. Pink Shirt Day was inspired in 2007 by two high school students from Nova Scotia, David Shepherd and Travis Price. When they discovered that a male classmate was bullied for wearing a pink shirt to school, they decided to take action. They went to a nearby store and bought pink shirts to give out to students, and they reached out to their fellow students to get them on board. The next day, many students were wearing the purchased shirts, and hundreds wore their own pink clothing. When the teen who was being bullied arrived at school, he was overwhelmed by the show of support.", "Now, Pink Shirt Day has become an annual event to speak out against bullying in schools, communities and workplaces. Our government has led the way by developing strong legislation such as the Accepting Schools Act, and resources for school boards to address bullying and victimization through prevention, intervention and supports.", "The Accepting Schools Act, which passed in 2012, was the first legislation of its kind in Canada. This important legislation is helping to make every school in Ontario a safe, inclusive and accepting place to learn, while at the same time ensuring that every student has the support to reach their full potential.", "On Monday, our government took further steps toward ending bullying by releasing the revised, up-to-date health and phys-ed curriculum. We need to update our curriculum so that students understand the importance of things like healthy, respectful relationships, having the confidence to say “no,” safe use of technology and the Internet to help eliminate cyberbullying, developing inclusive communities, and mental health.", "As Ontarians, we must all work together.", "Many schools and school communities are already demonstrating leadership in fostering and maintaining positive school climates through whole-school approaches that engage all members of the school community. I want to thank our educators, students and school communities for their leadership and commitment in creating safe, inclusive and accepting school environments that are essential for student achievement and well-being.", "This is also fundamental for our renewed vision for education. Our vision will help prepare our students to achieve excellence for a productive and successful future. But students can’t properly focus on their future if they are afraid to go to school. We know that bullying and intimidation have an immediate negative impact on student well-being and their ability to succeed in school.", "That is why, Speaker, Pink Shirt Day is so important. It’s an opportunity to remind us all that everyone has a part to play in creating a positive school climate and in fostering healthy and respectful relationships. Those efforts must not be limited to a single day, but instead woven into day-to-day practices and embedded in the culture of the school.", "I encourage every member in the House today to recognize Pink Shirt Day and to continue to promote the well-being of our students, so that everyone feels respected, accepted and valued. Today, let’s use this opportunity to come together, to make a difference in the lives of Ontario’s children, students and families." ],

A lot of people will ask what that is or will say, “We didn’t know that we had an awareness day.” But I can tell you from the people I’ve spoken to, Speaker, anybody who has had a repetitive strain injury will tell you very, very clearly why we need this day.", "The goal of this day is to raise awareness of the debilitating nature of repetitive strain injuries and ways we can all prevent them.", "Each year we mark Repetitive Strain Injury Awareness Day to promote the avoidance of such injuries, which, while they may not be life-threatening, can certainly be painfully life-altering.", "At the Ministry of Labour, and throughout Ontario’s health and safety system, we use a broader term: musculoskeletal disorders, or MSDs for short. This term describes the injuries and disorders of the musculoskeletal system that can be caused or aggravated by not only repetitive work but also by forceful exertions, fixed or awkward postures, vibration and other physical causes.", "Regardless of what we call these injuries, preventing them is always better than trying to cure them after the fact. These injuries take a tremendous toll on our workforce. They account for more than 40% of all lost-time injuries that are allowed by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board.", "If you look beyond the pain, the suffering, the social, emotional and economic costs to affected individuals, you’ll also see there are economic costs to MSDs to all of us, estimated at more than $26 billion annually. I think we can do better than this. These injuries, for the most part, are entirely preventable. Ontario workers and employers have numerous resources to help protect against these often painful MSDs. These resources can be found through my ministry, through the WSIB, through all our health and safety partners across this province and the many other sources that are interested in workers’ health and safety in Ontario.", "Year-round, the Ministry of Labour and its partners continue to enforce workplace legislation, to raise awareness of hazards in the workplace, to train workplace parties, and we also research the issue of MSDs and how we can further prevent them. Now, when we go and do a workplace visit, the ministry’s occupational health and safety inspectors focus on a number of things: They look at ensuring that those workplaces have a functioning internal responsibility system; they identify the hazards in the workplace, and that includes MSD hazards; as well, they ensure compliance with our existing health and safety legislation.", "Ministry of Labour occupational health and safety inspectors also receive training in MSD hazard recognition. All employers in the province of Ontario are responsible under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for taking every precaution that’s reasonable under the circumstances to protect the health and the safety of their workers. This includes protection from workplace hazards that can lead to these disorders. Ministry inspectors and ergonomists issue orders under the act and the regulations that accompany that act. They require employers to implement measures addressing MSD hazards for ergonomic assessments and related preventive measures, complete ergonomic assessments in the workplace, and provide worker training to prevent MSDs.", "The government is committed to reducing MSDs right here in the province of Ontario. We know there remains much more to do. We must continue to create that positive change in a collaborative way, in co-operation with both the workers and the employers in this province. We must continue to promote a culture of prevention in the province. I’m convinced that if we all work together we can achieve that goal we all want; that being safer, healthier workplaces right throughout the province of Ontario." ],

I appreciate the fact that the church itself has taken a leadership role in making sure that the facilities are there, that the doors are open and that students who come there feel that sense of security, safety and belonging that, unfortunately, all too often, they don’t feel in other places.", "It’s incumbent on us, on a day like today, to remind everyone in this society that this kind of bigotry is unacceptable, and to say that teaching in our schools that people have different gender identities and different gender orientations, and that that is entirely a part of our human nature—it’s important for us to do that and move it forward through this society.", "Again, today we should acknowledge those who stood up years ago on this day to make a difference, and acknowledge and recognize everyone who today is standing up, taking risks and making a difference." ],

She doesn’t know if she can deal with the stress of continuing to pursue WSIB again for very little benefits, and there’s always the downside risk that they’ll take away more benefits.", "She would love to go back to work, but they won’t provide a proper ergonomic environment for her to work in. Psychologically, she is a mess. She can’t deal with the battles she continues to have with WSIB and her employers to accommodate her injury. The stress of having no money, chronic pain, sleeplessness and having to fight for what is right has left her unable to concentrate and focus. She struggles each and every day.", "Speaker, this is emblematic—symptomatic—of a failure of this government to actually do anything when it comes specifically to repetitive strain injury—something that’s all too common in our workplaces—but more broadly, injured workers in general, when they have to deal with the WSIB.", "It’s all good to dedicate a day, and I’m sure we all understand the challenges that people face with workplace injuries. But, my goodness, let’s do something, put our efforts forward, ensure that WSIB actually functions as it should and was designed: to compensate workers when they are injured on the job; not to ostracize them and not to marginalize them, but to actually help them get back to work in a proactive way, to support them and their families, so that they can be functional members of society.", "The system is broken. The Liberals have destroyed it over the past decade. It’s not getting any better.

  "text" : [ "The ORPP is marketed as a mandatory tool to make Ontarians save for their retirement. Savings are what taxpayers have after paying taxes, utilities, rent or mortgages, insurance and food for their families. Premier Wynne’s policies have driven up the costs of all of these essential components of a family’s budget, eroding our disposable income and thus preventing Ontarians from being able to save.", "Taxes: Well, they’ve doubled. The debt’s up, and there’s no plan to tackle the huge rising cost of servicing the debt.", "Utilities: They’re up, too. Hydro has more than doubled since the government took over and is forecast to go up another 68% in the next 20 years because of the Green Energy Act.", "Rent: It has increased because of utilities and massive cuts to municipal transfers. My riding of Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry alone has seen close to a million-dollar cut in OMPF funding.", "Insurance: Ontario pays the highest rates for car insurance, especially in the GTA. This is strangling our economic hub.", "Food: Wynne’s new proposed carbon tax will drive up the cost of producing, transporting and packaging the food we buy, and will hit the most vulnerable disproportionately.", "When the Liberals take money out of Ontarians’ pockets, they deprive Ontarians of the ability to invest their savings into their chosen retirement options, which include RRSPs and tax-free savings accounts.", "When polled, most Ontarians say that they would like to save more for retirement. Premier Wynne is of the opinion that she can just force them to and the savings will happen. This is both patronizing and arrogant. Pension contributions and other retirement savings tools serve two purposes: to ensure an income during old age and to shield current and medium-term income from taxation.", "By contributing to our RRSP, we usually forego the enjoyment of a higher income that would be taxed at a higher bracket, to have it returned to us later, taxed at a lower rate. With a TFSA the argument is simple: to shield from the tax man capital gains made from our savings.", "In 2013, the last taxation year available, Ontario’s total employed workforce numbered approximately 7.3 million, according to Stats Canada. During the same taxation year, 2.2 million contributed to an RRSP, less than one third, despite the tax incentives of doing so. The ORPP would not offer workers or the province added value, because it would not complement the benefits of RRSP, CPP and TFSA contributions; it would only substitute voluntary and personally managed retirement savings with a mandatory and unaccountable program that will not pay a cent for decades.", "Moreover, the ORPP would substitute itself for federal income security programs—that is, Old Age Security and the guaranteed income supplement—since its payouts would be clawed back from those programs. Forty years from now, retired Ontarians are likely to find themselves poorer overall by having been deprived of some of the necessities and/or perks their lost income would have provided.", "Premier Wynne complains that Ontarians aren’t saving enough for retirement, but figures prove her wrong. According to Statistics Canada, private pension holdings in Ontario increased by 47% between 2005 and 2012. Ontarians have doubled their holdings in mutual funds and more than doubled their stocks, and they have made significant investments in real estate property.", "The one common characteristic of all these contributions to net worth is that Premier Wynne doesn’t have an easy way of dipping into these reserves to finance her government’s spending addiction. She therefore needs a new revenue stream with little to no built-in accountability and the floodgate keys in the Premier’s office.", "The entire purpose of a pension plan and any long-term investment is to lock the funds in and reap the benefits in many years’ time. But by the same token, long-term bonds pay a higher rate than short-term ones—the investor is rewarded for confidence and patience. In their first speech on the subject, however, the government makes it clear that the purpose of the ORPP is to be unlocked by the same government that wasted billions on eHealth, power plants and Ornge, and throws good money after bad.", "The Liberals have been very open about their intention to use the ORPP for purposes completely unrelated to Ontarians’ retirement security. Behind buzz words like “unlocking assets” lies the naked truth that the ORPP would be nothing more than a political slush fund. Moreover, if a supposed toll highway was built with pension money, Ontarians would pay twice—once for the contribution and again through the toll—but receive only a pittance back. This is worse than a Ponzi scheme; even the early participants lose.", "Ontarians need this government to leave more money in their pockets so they can save it better than Premier Wynne can ever be trusted to. It is her government that has made life less affordable in this province. A look at household expenditures in Ontario between 2010 and 2013 shows this. Ontarians would save more if this government allowed them to. Instituting another mandatory payroll tax is not the answer, because the money isn’t there.", "The ORPP will impact small businesses disproportionately. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business reported that over 80% of small businesses are opposed to the ORPP and would face difficult choices if it was implemented. Two thirds would consider freezing or cutting salaries to account for the extra contribution, while more than half would scale back on their capital investments or their workforce. When businesses can’t invest in new equipment, new locations, new employees and training, we all suffer.", "This government’s intention to grind Ontario to a halt by removing capital from the economy, whether through taxes, fees, inflated utility prices or the ORPP, hurts the economy. If we boost Ontarians’ earnings and create jobs for the 600,000 unemployed who need our greatest help to return to the workforce, we begin by leaving more money in Ontarians’ hands to spend, save and invest according to personal plans and preferences.", "I do not believe for a minute that the Premier or any other government official can know what’s best for residents of Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry 40 years from now. Every worker adapts their savings and investment patterns to long-term goals.", "There are always ways to stimulate savings and offer more opportunities for Ontarians to shield income from taxation in order to save for retirement. The mandatory job-killing and unaccountable ORPP, however, embodies the worst defects of the Liberal government: overreaching, patronizing and downright greedy.", "We were talking today about a petition on a new Ford plant in western Ontario. Companies are leaving because of payroll taxes. This is another payroll tax. Studies show that this will cost 160 man-years of employment. This is employment when we’re trying to help out the people in greatest need, people who are looking for a job today.", "We talk about the 600,000. This increases that number. It reduces the revenue that the government has available to them. People who are now retired or unemployed will not see any benefit from this. People who pay into it will not see benefits for many years. It is money that’s taken out of the economy. We think we should be investing in the economy and we shouldn’t be removing money and putting more stress on our businesses.", "An agri-food business in western Ontario is leaving and expanding in Michigan. He quotes two issues: the payroll taxes—he actually mentioned the ORPP—and energy costs. These are direct impacts of this government.", "It’s time that we start looking at what’s best for this province and start looking at putting in plans that actually get people working again—favourable for labour and employers to actually work together as a team, investing in our future. We need to put more money into education. Instead of closing colleges, we should be looking at opening them and maintaining some of the programs we have.", "I hear them talk about the importance of the agri-food industry, arguably our number one job generator in this province. The impact, though, is that we closed the only English-language college in eastern Ontario and put the French-language college certainly in jeopardy. We’re waiting to see. We just have to turn the scales and do what’s right for the province." ],

I was at an event last night, a community kitchen, and they were talking about what kind of people need the community kitchen. Seniors came up because there’s a lot of female seniors who are widowed. They used to have two pensions when their husband—or partner or spouse—was alive, but now they’re down to one pension. They’re really struggling because they didn’t have these great jobs that paid a good retirement plan or pensions. They are getting their CPP and the Old Age Security and anything they can max out, but they’re still having trouble paying the rent and they’re still having trouble buying groceries.", "What the London community is doing, and I’m sure many communities across the province, is they have these community kitchens. For this particular example that I went to, for $25 people come together—all the food is purchased—and they create meals in this kitchen, and you go home with 25 servings for $25. What I’ve heard is that, first of all, it’s a great thing to get seniors out of their home and socialize. Besides that, there are benefits because the cost of food is going up. Seniors can’t afford nutritious meals. So that was a help.", "The socialization piece, the affordability piece and the nutrition piece—so when we talk about pensions and we talk about seniors, affordability is a huge issue. We have to do better in the future for our seniors when it comes down to retiring with dignity." ],

Well, Speaker, that’s what pension plans are. You contribute over the course of your working life so that you can take the money out when you retire. That’s how pension plans are actually supposed to work.", "What we know is that there are a lot of studies out there that Ontarians aren’t saving enough to actually maintain their standard of living in retirement, or in some cases, as the member before me just mentioned, are struggling to buy food. There have been three studies that have been released in the last few weeks that highlight this. One I was listening to on TV the other night that caught my attention was a poll that RBC had just released a few days ago. They talked about the fact that only 39% of respondents had put away any money for their retirement in 2014, and that 30% of the respondents had never put away any money for their retirement. We know that if that’s the case, that if people aren’t saving for their retirement, they’re not going to have enough money to live on when they retire. The average payout by the Canada Pension Plan is only $6,800. Of course, you can’t live on that when you retire. We need to help people save." ],

On Bill 56, commenting to the member from Stormont, my main concern—I’m hearing it from small business operators across the province—just as recently as Monday morning, I had a meeting with colleges and universities in Ontario and they have a real concern on the undergraduate students working at the universities. I have put this on the record because I think it’s important that it’s on there. It will cost the undergraduate students 1.9% and the university 1.9% as well, so a total of 3.8%. What they’re telling me is, this is a budget that is already as tight as it can possibly be and they’re asking me to ask the minister. I’m not sure if this government will move this thing forward right to 2018 or not or they’ll actually listen to the public and possibly make major changes or even withdraw it. I know this is going to have an impact on a lot of jobs across the province, but if we could at least listen to this one point, and that’s the fact that university undergraduate students, who get very few hours to begin with—this is a lot of money out of their pockets, the total of 3.8%. They’re asking us to pass this on because this amount of money has basically been frozen for a number of years now. They’re actually saying, “Please listen to us. It’s something we can’t absorb.” If the government could listen to that, it just adds to the comments that were made by the member, Mr. McDonell." ],

But one of the things that the member mentioned as a concern—I think we would echo the same concern about unlocking value from government assets and the threat of potential use of funds for government purposes other than for retirement. That is something, as we have said before, that we would encourage the government to reassure us of, that that money is going to be further than arm’s-length, that it cannot be used for a nefarious purpose or for any other government purpose other than for retirement.", "Another interesting point that the member raised was that Ontarians would save more if the government allowed them to. I’m sure we all have heard from our constituents who are struggling with their hydro bills and struggling to afford health care costs now, insurmountable education debt, child care costs, dental costs, any number of things that are just adding to the financial burden pile of Ontarians. They are having a difficult time saving, and so this Ontario Retirement Pension Plan is an important piece in giving opportunities for those who are not able to, who have not been saving to this point.", "When we talk about long-term goals and we talk about retirement, it is a big picture on how everyone fits together in this economy. We’ve talked about that before, that everyone deserves a chance to participate in that economy, and businesses, of course, will be impacted now, but imagine the shape they’ll be in when no one is able to participate and come through their doors." ],

I see in our own community that that’s a big problem. Food is not readily available for many of them. Food bank uses are way up.", "But you look at the costs of necessities that have gone up: hydro costs, property taxes. One of the investments that is very key to our seniors is the fact that, in many cases, they own their own homes. That’s going to be less affordable in the future; now we’re taking money away that could go to mortgages that are paid off over 20 or 30 years. That reduces the amount of income they have. There is a fear that when you’re putting money into some of these volunteer programs or even the pension plans—they typically go into the highest rate of return. These are being put into pools of money that will be accessible by the government. Hopefully, in the future, the government will have the money to pay it back. But we’ve seen governments around the world that have spending like this one that haven’t had the money to pay it back. You go to Greece; pensions were exhausted. That’s the fear.", "The other issue that I’m raising is that these will not be accessible for many years, because they’ve made many of the people who are having trouble today think that this will benefit them. Seniors who are needing more money today are looking at a hope from this legislation, but there’s nothing farther from the truth, because they will not benefit from it. Many of the people who are having trouble today are unemployed today. They will not benefit either. The people they are helping are the people who are contributing to their own pension plans, hopefully at a higher rate than will be guaranteed through this government, which is only interested in getting money at the cheapest rate and able—I mean, with Moody’s latest credit downgrade, there may not be money there on the market for them to borrow in the future.", "I want to thank everybody for the comments." ],

In a report tabled this past December by Statistics Canada, the data shows that 12% of our seniors live in poverty, amounting to almost 600,000 people. Seniors living alone are particularly hard-pressed financially, with more than one in four single seniors, most of whom are women, living in poverty. Given that most retirement experts recommend that we aim to replace 50% to 70% of our income in retirement to maintain a similar living standard, the real question becomes: How are we going to achieve this goal?", "Obviously, enhancing the Canada Pension Plan is the best possible option. However, the Harper government stubbornly refused to consider it. Five years later, this government has finally come to understand what New Democrats have been saying: that if we want it, we must take this challenge right here at the provincial level.", "Yet the numbers do not favour us. In Ontario, the majority of workers do not belong to a workplace pension plan of any kind. In fact, 66.7% of workers in Ontario currently do not have a workplace pension plan.

We challenge this government to stand up for all Ontarians by not caving in to the insurance industry and other corporate interests. Do not allow the ORPP to become a watered-down version of what is meant to be a secure and adequate retirement income for all Ontarians.", "Let’s take a closer look at what is being proposed here. I think we can all agree that the devil is in the details. As I understand it, Bill 56 provides the following directives:", "“1. (1) The government of Ontario shall, no later than January 1, 2017 and in accordance with the parameters set out in this act, establish the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.”", "It also lays out that at a later date “the Minister of Finance or another member of the executive council shall introduce legislation that ...", "“(b) provides for the administration and investment management of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan through the administrative entity described in section 2; and", "“(c) provides for the requirements of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, including the basic requirements....”", "Essentially, this bill says that another two bills are on the way. One bill will administer the plan and handle asset management responsibilities, and another will deal with the plan design, with all components of the plan mandated to be up and running by January 1, 2017.", "I know that I’m not alone when I express a serious lack of confidence in this government’s ability to establish an arm’s-length administrative body. We need only look as far as the Ornge, gas plant and eHealth scandals to be justified in our skepticism.", "Frankly, we can ill afford to allow them to get this one wrong. There are too many people in need of help and too much at stake. Too many people are counting on us to get this done right the first time.", "With that in mind, let’s return to the bare details that we have been presented with by looking at the schedule of the basic requirements of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. Here is what we know:", "First, eligible employers and eligible employees shall contribute to the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. This gives us an idea of the obligation of eligible employers to deduct contributions and the remittance to a yet-to-be-established administrative entity.", "We find out that the maximum threshold for 2017 will be $90,000 and that the combined employer/employee contribution rate shall not exceed 3.8%.", "It further goes on to note that some employees will be eligible and others will be exempt. Those with a comparable plan will be exempt. Retirement benefits shall be paid for the life of a plan member, beginning at age 65.", "At this point, it is unclear what is meant by “comparable.” Is a defined contribution plan considered comparable? Long-standing defined benefit pension plans like the OPTrust, OMERS, HOOPP and CAAT Pension Plan, as well as the government-managed Canada Pension Plan, provide significant benefits to our economy yet have received no mention here.", "I did want to note that unlike the CPP, which allows pension contributions on earnings up to only $52,000 a year, the ORPP, as proposed, would allow contributions on income up to $90,000 a year. This is a welcome inclusion that could allow many middle-class Ontarians to save much more than they currently can under the CPP ceiling, meaning their retirement incomes could be substantially higher as a result.", "While there are a few more details included, I find that there are certainly more questions than answers raised with this bill. Clearly, there are far more details of the ORPP to be worked out. The government has stated their intention to work them out through consultations, yet for many, the consultation process has been lacking. My office has already begun to receive calls and emails from constituents expressing their concerns about what this bill will mean for them, and quite frankly, I wish I had more information to offer them in return.", "I am certain that the insurance and banking industries have been well afforded the opportunity to have their position heard at the highest levels of this government. However, I am focused on the many voices that were not offered a seat at the table during the consultations. It is our duty to speak for those who could not.", "According to the 2013 report Defined Benefit Pension Plans: Strengthening the Canadian Economy, pensions sustain retirees, lift seniors out of poverty and contribute to the economy of communities.", "“Pensions are critical to the economy of smaller towns and rural communities”—that’s something the Conservatives may be interested in—“where they represent a large percentage of local income ... in Elliot Lake, for example, income from pensions (pensions, GIS, old age and CPP) represents approximately 35% of the local economy. The business generated from the resulting retiree spending represents many thousands of Ontario jobs.”", "While there may be several factors contributing to the lack of retirement savings in Ontario, we do know that the kind of pension we are proposing here could be a key economic factor to our small and rural communities.", "We must look at the long term and the need to ensure a dignified old age over many decades to come. We cannot give in to pressures of corporate need over those of our own seniors and retirees.", "Simply stated, New Democrats are seeking to help ensure that our seniors live with the dignity they deserve, and we are worried that this government will cave in to insurance interests and exempt employers.

Let’s think about Target. Most recently, Target left Canada, and we lost 17,000 jobs overall. In January, specifically, Target cited that the ORPP was one of the reasons that they could not invest in the future in Ontario. In my riding of Huron–Bruce, small business is big business, and it accounts for thousands of jobs and revenue in our communities. Hurting the job creators is the last thing this province needs.", "The pension plan worry is shared by so many. For instance, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business notes that 97% of small businesses are concerned about the current state of Ontario’s economy, and more than half say that they’ll reduce employees if the pension plan goes ahead. When are they going to accept what they’re doing to jobs in Ontario? That is the question here. They’re driving jobs away because they’ve had wasteful spending through the last decade, they’ve had so many scandals, and they need to find new revenue sources to help them pave the way so that they can try to spin a budget that makes sense.", "Collectively, we need to be doing everything that we can to make it easier for small businesses to thrive and create jobs here in Ontario. We could talk about energy, but I’ll get to that in a moment.", "Ontario is becoming less and less competitive. Earlier today I met with the petroleum industry, and they talked about the unintended consequences of the bad policies that are coming out of this particular government. At the end of it all, there is going to be less in the bottom line to employ people in Ontario, and it’s a real concern. We’re exporting our businesses to the States and to other provinces due to already high payroll costs, high electricity rates and proposed government initiatives such as carbon pricing and the ORPP.", "You know, facts speak for themselves. This Liberal government claims that people are not saving enough for their retirement, and that we have a huge economic crisis on our hands. Well, Speaker, again, the only crisis we have is a government that is proving themselves to be untrustworthy based on their by-election initiative in Sudbury, and they’re proving themselves untrustworthy because of their many scandals. We have to call this government to account when, in fact, they’re trying to create a crisis here, but we know—and we just heard it from the member from Nipissing—that Ontarians are saving enough. From 1999 to 2008, Ontario had the highest savings rate of all provinces in Canada, and currently Ontario sits at the national average.", "People who are struggling in pension years are often single, elderly individuals who may have never worked, and only receive 60% of their spouse’s CPP. These are the vulnerable people in our society who need help. However, this scheme that the Liberals have proposed will do nothing to help this group.", "In fact, back in January, I learned of a family in my riding, and it’s a sad state of affairs. Their mother is a single, elderly individual who cannot afford to pay her bills, and as a result, the siblings, on a monthly rotation, are paying her utilities so that she can stay in the family home. That is not the dream that she had for her children. This government needs to stand up and take responsibility for their wastefulness and for their failed schemes like the Green Energy Act, cut out the subsidies that people can’t afford, and once and for all, do something that really is respectful of Ontarians.", "The reason people are in difficult situations and finding it hard to save is, as I said, solely because of this Liberal government’s actions. Hydro rates are skyrocketing, people are finding it hard to make ends meet, and at the end of the month, as I said before, there isn’t very much to save for the future, sadly enough. How on earth could they afford further deductions through this imposed savings program?", "If this government had a more accurate and transparent energy policy, people would have the extra income to put away adequate money for retirement.", "Liberals claim that currently the CPP isn’t enough for Ontarians to retire on. That’s because—just a reminder—CPP was never intended to be a retirement income, but rather a supplement.", "Honestly, people cannot afford an Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. This government needs to go back to the drawing board and do better." ],

It’s about those kids who are here today, those young students. It’s about our kids, our grandkids. That’s what it’s all about. We have to find a way to make sure that when they grow old, when they become seniors, they’re not going to have to live in the province of Ontario in poverty, or not be able to pay for their health care. These are things we have to do.", "How can we do it? I’ll tell you how we do it. We should have done it under CPP. I went to Ottawa a number of times and I talked to MPs from all parties. Almost every party, until the last six months, agreed to enhance the CPP, including Conservatives, including Liberals, including the NDP, because they knew it was the right thing to do. They have a program in place that is already funded. It has enough money in it today to last 75 years. So if we enhance CPP, guess what’s going to happen? We’re going to be able to take care of our kids and our grandkids who are here watching us today, relying on us to make sure that they have a future when they become retirees.", "Take a look at what’s going on in our province today. It’s our fault, quite frankly, that we have people dying on our streets because it’s cold and they don’t have affordable housing. What are we doing when we have health care to take care of our seniors and they can’t afford it—or hydro bills? We have an opportunity, over the course of the next few days, through this debate, to make sure that doesn’t happen to any senior in the province of Ontario ever again and to make sure our kids have a future that they can be proud of, not only for themselves but for their kids and their grandkids." ],

She came to me the other day, in private, and said, “Mike, I’m embarrassed. Can I go to the food bank so I can have enough food for me and my disabled son to get through?” That’s disgraceful after all the years that she has worked.", "The member from Huron–Bruce says, “You don’t need the money. It’s everybody else’s fault. We can’t do it.” We must do it. We have the ability. We have the will. Stop making excuses why, in this rich country, we can’t help people like Edda, who worked their whole lives and are working a job in this cold weather at 72—and we say to her, “We can’t help you.” That’s wrong." ],

Do they want customers or do they want window-shoppers? Do they want people who don’t have enough money to spend in those businesses now or in the future? Do they want to close up in 10 years when nobody is able to contribute to the economy?", "It’s interesting too about the McKinsey report—a survey of households. How wonderful it would be for Ontarians to be able to plan to afford a house. Many of our Ontarians are struggling to pay rent, transit, dental and child care and all of the things that we talk about for them to even be able to afford a household in order to be surveyed, in order to be asked their opinions.

Obviously the current CPP is lacking, and I agree with the member earlier from Ottawa South that the federal government, under the leadership of Mr. Harper, is not going to be addressing the modernization of the CPP. He’s very clear on that. He’s very clear on the fact that he doesn’t want the long-form census—because you certainly wouldn’t want to have the data to actually develop policy and legislation to meet the needs of the people in this country. So I think it’s safe to say that we will not be seeing any leadership from Stephen Harper on CPP modernization. That’s full stop.", "Only 34% of workers have access to a workplace pension plan. This is a huge concern for us, absolutely. That’s why in 2010 we brought forward a private member’s bill on this issue. At the time, we did not receive support for it from the Liberals, but this Bill 56 has some elements of that legislation and so, of course, we’re happy to see it because the end goal is to ensure that people do have some income security down the line, that there is some stability. We’ve seen what happens when we don’t plan for that.", "There is an undersaving gap right now, and there are a couple of different reasons for that, to be quite honest. There’s more precarious work in the province of Ontario. There is more part-time work in the province of Ontario. There is more contract work in the province of Ontario. Those jobs rarely come with any sort of job security or, of course, any sort of pension plan whatsoever.", "The timing of this plan would coincide with the reduction in EI premiums. We are committed, on this side of the House—in this corner of the House, if you will—to ensuring that whatever plan goes forward actually is very strong and actually will be successful. That’s encompassing a lot of different voices, because we’ve been very clear about consulting with a number of traditional and non-traditional stakeholders and we are looking forward, of course, when this does get to committee, to making sure that something happens.", "Just to cover a few issues: Obviously the bill is in three pieces of legislation right now. The government plans to implement an Ontario Retirement Pension Plan at a certain date. There’s some question as to whether or not the legislation had to come forward in this manner. Certainly we don’t need legislation to talk about pensions, but there are obviously some politics at play.", "When I speak about politics, it’s obvious—the Liberal government is telling a story to the rest of the province about this pension plan. They would like to be talking about anything other than Sudbury or gas plants or emails, so we totally understand—they even rolled out sex ed; that’s how bad it is in the province of Ontario. That was the change-the-channel moment. Actually, thanks to the Conservatives, it worked very well for them—not for you guys and certainly not for the people of this province to get some substance, to get some answers from this government on a number of issues that are outstanding.", "I just keep going back to this moment during the general election when I knocked on a door and a lady came to the door and she said, “Well, you know, I really need a pension, and they’re going to give me a pension.” I said, “Well, have you worked ever in your life?” “Well, no, but they said they’re going to give me a pension.” I think we have to be honest that there’s a lot of misinformation out there. A lot of people don’t understand what this pension plan would look like for them, especially if they are seniors. We are talking about the future and planning for the future.", "After this part of the bill, a second bill will be responsible for the administration and the management, while a third bill will detail the specific design features of the plan. So the government is being very methodical about rolling out this piece of legislation because, quite honestly, I think it’s very clear that they’re trying to figure it out. Fortunately, we’re here to try to help you in that endeavour.", "Obviously, the ORPP will be mandatory for Ontarians without an existing company pension and is expected to be phased in by January 2017. It essentially ensures that employees and employers contribute 1.9% of their earnings toward it, up to a maximum income level of $90,000. But immediately, Mr. Speaker, the bill doesn’t yet stipulate what the minimum threshold is, and this is an outstanding question. It would be really good if someone on that side was listening. Has that been considered, and if so, what is the minimum annual income for eligibility? It does seem to me that those at the lowest level of income would be of greater need than those at the $90,000 level, as they would not necessarily have the opportunity to invest in savings themselves, given their working years.", "We also know that any contributions from the Canada Pension Plan would be paid on top of it. For those employees who earn less than the $70,000 mark in annual income, the ORPP benefit will end up being less than the CPP benefit. It will only be comparable to the CPP benefit for those earning close to the $90,000 income range. It would also be significantly less than those benefits provided by other pension plans, like OMERS or the teacher pension plans or HOOPP or OPT. So there are some outstanding questions about the design of the bill.", "I want to raise this issue because this has come up just sort of on the surface. The member from Oshawa recently in her comments addressed the fact that there is some concern about what will happen with this pension fund. I’m going to read, actually, from the budget. Another concern that we have around the design of the ORPP is concerning a little section in the 2014 budget, and it reads like this: “By unlocking value from its assets and encouraging more Ontarians to save through a proposed new Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, new pools of capital would be available for Ontario-based projects such as building roads, bridges and new transit,” and then they’ve tied those funds to the AFP process, which the Auditor General of this province has highlighted as being very concerning.", "Actually, I just had a really good meeting with the Auditor General. I went through some of the numbers that she highlighted. There’s a very organized pro-P3 movement that was, obviously, not very impressed with that Auditor General’s report. In fact, the government has been fairly flippant about it.", "But this idea that pension plan funds would be pooled and then redirected to another obvious need—I mean, this government is obviously desperate for revenue streams. We’ve seen that time and time again. Ed Clark has been charged with unlocking value, if you will.", "So this is a red flag for us because, quite honestly, there is not a lot of trust on this side of the House when the Liberal government starts talking about unlocking value. We haven’t seen any evidence that that can be successful, and one has to question, if the design of this plan does not meet some of the outstanding questions that we’ve already outlined, where is this money going to go? How is it going to be managed? Quite honestly, the Auditor General said that $8.2 billion was overspent on those infrastructure projects, those 74 infrastructure projects. In the analysis of the value for money and the risk, she said that there’s no empirical evidence to it. So, really, when you look at the numbers for those 74 infrastructure projects, we spent, just on additional financing, at a high interest rate—credit card rates, borrowing money—$6.5 billion.", "That is an obvious place where this government, I would hope, would be looking to find savings, so that all the other issues that we’ve raised here around why an ORPP is necessary—around senior levels of poverty, around gaps in health care funding, around a lack of vision around child care and the gaps in quality child care. There’s a lot of money going to those financial corporations and those banks and those lawyers and those consultants that should be directed to the needs that we see every day in our ridings.", "When the finance minister highlights the fact that he sees the ORPP as pools of new capital, it’s quite concerning for us. We hope to find some clarity as this bill moves forward. As I said, we’re committed to making it stronger and listening to those diverse voices who want to weigh in on it." ],

One is lifespan, one is health span, and the third is the money span. Unfortunately, the demographics are telling us that these are not coincident. If you’re born in 1900 in the country of Canada, your life expectancy as a male is approximately 53 to 55 years. If you’re born today, your life expectancy hits about 80 years.

I guess we should commend ourselves for being a healthier society, but there is a reason to plan.", "The member from Perth–Wellington says that my comments convinced him to vote against it. I guess that’s my job. From my perspective, from our perspective, there is legislation that is worth standing up for and working for to strengthen. There are some outstanding questions, as I mentioned, around the design of this piece of legislation, which need our attention and which we’re committed to doing.", "I did wonder how long it was going to take for a member to bring up the issue of evolution. That was just in time, I think.", "Around the fiscal part of this piece of legislation, fortunately today it was just announced that the Financial Accountability Officer—the motion was passed, and he has been hired. This was something, as you know, that we fought for because we recognized that there needs to be another lens of fiscal responsibility, accountability and transparency in this House. We’re looking forward to this independent officer of the Legislature getting work done and applying a new level of scrutiny to financial decisions in this House. I think that that has actually been a long time coming. I hope that, as an independent officer of this Legislature, the Financial Accountability Officer may garner a little bit more support and respect than the Auditor General, who brought forward a very thorough Auditor General’s report just before Christmas which was dismissed by the Liberals. That’s an improvement we fought for and are very proud of." ],

Before I start on my remarks, I want to thank the member for Oshawa and NDP pension critic for her excellent lead speech and work on this file.", "As everyone in this chamber is aware—and if you’re not, I’ll be sure to repeat it a few times during my time today—my community of Windsor West offers some of the highest-quality labour across the province, in a number of industries and across a number of sectors. We have a developing technology sector, a thriving tourist and service sector and, of course, a strong foundation in automotive and auto parts manufacturing.", "Windsor has one of the most celebrated automotive sectors in North America, and the industry is woven into the fabric of our community. One of the cornerstones of the automotive sector and truly one of the many reasons this industry is so attractive to work in is the historic quality of the private-sector pensions offered to auto workers.", "I think it’s important to note that workers fought hard for these pensions and continue to fight hard to preserve their retirement security along with that of the next generation. We have some of the best union representation from the auto sector in the country, with Unifor Locals 444 and 200, to name just a couple. These locals have active retirees’ associations that continue to contribute to our economy, and I’m always glad to see representatives from these organizations at events in Windsor.", "When people feel safe and secure in their retirement, the whole community benefits. Pensions allow people the freedom to retire securely. This means more time spent with friends and family and enjoying what you have worked your whole life to achieve. It also means the financial freedom to travel and spend time enjoying local attractions like golf courses, coffee shops, fitness centres, our wonderful waterfront and casino, and experiencing all that Windsor has to offer.", "The whole economy benefits when retirees have a disposable income that can be injected back into our economy. This lifestyle is threatened. Young workers today do not have the same access to the pension plans their mothers and fathers did before them. All too often I receive calls from someone who has taken out a student loan to get an education only to graduate and be forced to work multiple jobs in an unrelated field to pay back their loans.", "All too often, these workplaces do not have workplace pension programs. In fact, roughly two out of three Canadians do not currently have a workplace pension. Even among the one third that does, their pension plans may not be sufficient to carry them through retirement.", "The retirement security crisis is not a trend that will manifest itself at some point in the distant future, but something we are experiencing right now across the province. As stated by our critic in her lead address to this chamber, the average monthly cost for seniors’ housing in Ontario last year was over $2,750. If we look at 2012 housing data for people over 65, seniors are coming up more than $500 short every month. That’s only taking housing into account.", "The bill before us today, Bill 56, seeks to address at least part of this problem by closing the gap between what people are saving for retirement and their projected expenses. The details of the bill have been discussed at length, but I think it’s worth it to bring up a few key issues of this bill and what we know so far about the ORPP.", "The bill states: “The government of Ontario shall, no later than January 1, 2017, and in accordance with the parameters set out in this act, establish the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.”", "The bill goes on to state that another bill will be tabled and will outline who will administer and manage the plan, along with detailing a yet-to-be-established administrative entity.", "What will the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan look like? So far, we know that the ORPP would make both the employer and employee contribute to the plan to a maximum of 3.8%. We also know that the maximum threshold will be $90,000.", "If this discussion around the ORPP is starting to sound a bit familiar, that’s because it is. As the people of Ontario know, the NDP has long been a supporter of public pensions. As everyone in this chamber knows, we proposed an Ontario public pension plan back in early 2010, although there are some differences between our plan and the plan being discussed in 2015. This was done after extensive consultations across the province with hard-working Ontarians who wanted more stability in their retirement.", "Unfortunately, the Liberal government of the day did not support this plan. They did not support the idea of an Ontario pension plan back then. Well, we all make mistakes, and I’m glad to see this government has finally come around and embraced the idea of a pension plan for Ontario. It’s unfortunate that the government is only getting around to developing this plan now, when we could have started implementing an Ontario pension plan as far back as 2010. Better late than never, I suppose.", "Windsor did have a chance to weigh in on the pension plan in February. One of the issues that came up was the failure of the federal government to increase existing Canada Pension Plan contributions. Rather than acknowledge this crisis, the federal government recommended a pooled retirement pension plan, or PRPP. These plans put big banks ahead of people, and that is something we don’t support. So in the absence of the preferred option of expanding the CPP, the Ontario pension plan is the next best thing.", "Chris Taylor, president of Windsor and District Labour Council, stated, “The federal government unfortunately refuses to act on that plan and that leaves little choice but for provinces to come up with bold plans to ensure the betterment of the people in their province.”", "As the member representing Niagara Falls, Fort Erie and Niagara-on-the-Lake mentioned while speaking to this bill yesterday, it’s not that Ontarians don’t know how to save; it’s that the cost of living in this province is so high that people are struggling.", "Every week, my office receives calls and emails about hydro bills that are out of control. My constituents email me copies of their hydro bills under the heading, “The middle class cannot afford this.” One person stated, “Our hydro bills are costing us an arm and a leg. People are having trouble paying $200 to $300 a month and the cost of living is going up. I don’t know … soon people aren’t going to be able to pay rent, food … bills etc.”", "Well, Speaker, I listen and I tend to agree. This is why we are struggling to save in Ontario.", "Along with the ORPP, we need to find ways to make life more affordable. We need to find ways to increase employment in southwestern Ontario, invest and diversify our economy.", "Many people in this province are forced to move to find work, or circumstances see them change jobs throughout their lives. I held a number of jobs before the people of Windsor West elected me to be their representative. As a teen, I took my first job at a local café, then went on to be a dental assistant and, finally, a marriage officiant. Since a number of people in Ontario hold multiple jobs throughout their lives, the government needs to consider the issue of portability of the ORPP. As people move between workplaces, their pension needs to move with them. We need to account for a number of unique circumstances here, including how to accommodate workers that move in and out of the province.", "We also need to consider how this plan will impact workers that have a comparable pension and then move to a workplace that does not. How will this plan affect these workers? I hope the government consults with people experiencing these conditions as the government moves forward with the ORPP.", "Speaker, I’ve enjoyed my time speaking to this bill and the future of the ORPP today. Pensioners know the value of pensions, and Ontarians know the value of pensions. Specifically, I want to thank all the pensioners who are standing up for the next generation of workers. They want our young people to be able to enjoy their retirement and have a similar standard and quality of life in their retirement as the generation that came before them. This is admirable, and it makes me proud to be from this province." ],

We know that the Conservatives are not going to support the bill. So I would like all this discussion to collapse and move it to committee. If there is a need to improve the bill, that’s the place where we could do it.", "A lot of us have spoken on it, and it seems like we need to have this happen; otherwise the government will have to support all these retirees who will not have a pension.

People who don’t have some type of medical plan are in trouble in this province, and that’s not something that the pension plan will help. That’s something that this government can help with.", "I was a little distressed when I heard the member from Eglinton–Lawrence talking about an elderly couple with a disabled child. I see that. I was surprised at the number of people who have disabled children. It’s embarrassing that we’re expecting the parents to take care of them. This province is rich enough that disabled people should be looked after by this government. It’s a shame that there have been no increases for 10 years. We met with the groups, and they’ve had no funding increases for 10 years.", "We talked about people who get no respite. This is something that’s not going to be solved by a pension plan. This is a problem with this government and priorities. They talk about one third of the people having pension plans. Most people in this province have saved for themselves.

There are two conversations happening at the same time: this new plan and ensuring that it is developed and designed for those who don’t have a workplace pension, and to focus on securing and strengthening and protecting existing pensions.", "Recently, GM committed to doing business in Ontario and to continue doing business in Canada. That’s very important for those in Oshawa who now know that their pensions are secure, at least in the foreseeable future.", "But as my colleague mentioned, some existing pensions are insufficient to provide for people in their retirement. I think those individuals need to be factored into the conversation, as we’ve talked about, when we’re looking at specific design features of this new Ontario Retirement Pension Plan and talking about comparability. I would challenge the government to look at the arguments for universality and how to include more people, to look at those arguments so that you’re not just comparing plan to plan but specific situations, people to people.", "My colleague also mentioned CPP expansion.

That’s a great concern for many people.", "The member from Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry touched on some affordability issues and the cost of living. Again, the cost of living is quite high. We have people who are deciding between paying a hydro bill and being able to eat. That’s a very unfortunate circumstance, and that shouldn’t be happening. If those people didn’t have to make a decision like that, if the hydro rates weren’t so high, they would likely have the money to put aside into a pension plan of their own. So I would call on the government to address those issues and make life more affordable for everyone across Ontario.", "The member from Oshawa talked about protecting pensions across the board, not just public pensions but those from private companies as well. I know I touched a lot on the auto sector and the manufacturing sector. But there are other sectors as well that have private pensions, and the people who devote their lifetime to working in these businesses need to know that when they’re ready to retire, their pension is safe, that a company can’t just close up shop and leave, and they’ve lost everything that they have worked for.", "The member from Newmarket–Aurora talked about poverty. Again, I believe that goes back to talking about making life more affordable for everyone. The government certainly needs to do a lot of work around poverty and making life more affordable, giving people the opportunities to be able to save for their own future, for education, for a home and for a life in post-retirement. So, again, anything that would support someone having security in their retirement, I think, is a good direction to be moving." ],

They’re forcing through their budget in a very limited amount of time. They don’t want us talking about the budget because there were a lot of magic beans that were used in this budget. There was a lot of masking of facts and smoke and mirrors that were used in this budget that they don’t want us to talk about, and they’ve done a very, very poor job on planning how it’s going to make its way through this House. That’s why we’re faced with the motion we’re faced with today.", "This is the sixth budget that I’ve debated in this Legislature. Actually, that’s not true. I’ve debated five. We’ve had six budgets presented in the Legislature since I’ve been here in 2011, but one of them we didn’t get to debate because an election was called, so we debated it when it was presented again in 2014.", "What we’re dealing with here today is a time allocation motion on the budget bill, which is an omnibus piece of legislation that amends 33 different schedules—or, at least, there are 33 schedules in this budget bill today. When you listen to what the House leader just described, we’re talking about a very, very limited scope of debate on all of these different schedules that are in the budget bill this year.", "So we’re here this morning debating one of the most, if not the most, restrictive time allocations that I’ve seen in my six years in the House: an afternoon for committee hearings and a morning for clause-by-clause on a budget?", "This bill has 33 schedules and was introduced just a couple of weeks ago by the finance minister. The government here is stating nothing short of the fact that it would prefer members not do their jobs. It would prefer us not to take a closer look at the budget that was presented. Keep in mind, this is a government that at times has had to offer dozens of amendments on its own government bills, its own legislation, because they’ve messed up serious technical details involved with the implementation.", "On a massive omnibus piece of legislation, the government believes 30 minutes of debate at third reading is sufficient—not just 30 minutes per party; 30 minutes shared in the Legislature, 30 minutes at third reading to debate the budget for the province of Ontario. It’s unbelievable. People should be outraged, but they don’t really know what’s going on, because for some this is inside baseball. Really, it’s amateur hour on behalf of the government of Ontario, because they can’t get their House in order. That has been proven time and time again over the last 14 years that they’ve been in power. They’ve messed up everything.", "You look at the health care system in the province of Ontario and the mess we’re in there. You look at our education system and the mess we’re in there, closing schools all across the province. The most school closures anywhere ever are happening right here in Ontario. You look at our energy sector, and we could go on forever there about the mess they’ve made on our electricity system and the prices that we’re paying.", "I digress.", "As I said earlier, the bill has 33 schedules, and the government is saying that it requires less than one minute per schedule at third reading. It’s unbelievable. That should tell you everything you need to know about how the government views the voters who send us here to Queen’s Park to debate on their behalf.", "The stated rationale for doing this, by the way, is that the government knew that in order to introduce a different piece of legislation, the government had to pass the budget first. So debate in this House is left to suffer, public scrutiny is left to suffer, because the government House leader’s office and the Premier’s office don’t know how to manage the House schedule. We know they don’t know how to manage the province’s finances. That has been very clear. They’re playing all kinds of games with the numbers to make it appear as if they have a balanced budget in Ontario, when I think every financial expert out there knows that they haven’t done that. Debate in this House suffers as a result.", "As a general rule, budgets are supposed to be financial plans for the government. We’re not only supposed to know where the money is coming from, but we’re also supposed to know where it’s being spent and how much of it is being spent there. On that score, the budget is surprisingly light on details as it pertains to the major-ticket items that are supposedly included in it. You can pretty well point to something that the government likes in this budget, and there’s a detail that comes up instantly that highlights something that the government left out.", "You can start with the centrepiece of this Liberal budget, the pharmacare, if you want. It’s the only thing that every Liberal went out and talked about the day after the budget—because I think nobody took them seriously when they told them that it was a balanced budget when clearly it wasn’t a balanced budget; it was an artificial balance. It’s the centrepiece of this budget, according to the government. But what was missing in the budget book? What was missing in the documents? The actual price of the program. They say that it will cost the treasury $465 million every year, and they say that because it’s not actually written anywhere in the budget. If you wanted to find that out in the lock-up, you had to ask a bureaucrat to get the information you were looking for.", "I want you to imagine something: A government comes out with a signature social program expansion—the one talking point that they wanted all government caucus members to go out and pump up in the immediate wake of the budget—and the cost of it isn’t in the province’s central financial document, which is either an incredible omission on the part of the Ministry of Finance, or it’s because the government doesn’t actually know how much the program is going to cost.", "Let’s examine what information has been publicly available by the government and its ministers.", "The government is saying that the cost of the program is $465 million. That’s to cover everyone under the age of 25 through the existing Ontario drug benefit for the entire prescription schedule. There are approximately four million people under the age of 25, give or take, according to the relevant minister. So the simplest thing to do would be to take the $465 million that the government says that the program costs and divide it by the four million eligible, and you’d get a per person cost for the program. In this case, it’s about $116 per person.", "Government members will point out that there are a lot of people under 25 who don’t use any pharmaceuticals, and that’s true. That could be an explanation for why the government’s program, which covers significantly more drugs, costs roughly the same as the program of the third party, which covers significantly more people. Or you can think that both of them just pulled numbers out of the clear blue sky, which is probably what happened. Or you can think that—" ],

You can find them all online at the ministry website.", "I respectfully submit that any belief that this program won’t cost that much because we’re dealing with a part of the population that tends to be more physically resilient ignores the current reality of Ontario youth. You may not pay for the same medications that are currently being used by Ontario drug benefit recipients, but that doesn’t mean you’ll end up paying for less of them.", "For that cost not to be itemized in the province’s fiscal plan, which we’re being asked to vote on, is malpractice on the part of the finance minister. A five-minute Google search gives you considerable reason to doubt the figure that this government has put on its signature proposal in the budget.", "I also want to point out that the Minister of Finance stated on The Agenda that the reason that he picked 25 as the cut-off age is because it was a round number. I’m not sure how many bureaucrats work in the Ministry of Finance—I know this government spends millions on private sector consultants, as though working in the PricewaterhouseCoopers building made you an endangered species—but none of them could come up with a better reason for 24 or 25 being the cut-off than it just happened to be a round number, so that’s encouraging as well.", "Let’s turn to the actual fiscal plan of the province, because this stuff tells us a lot about money coming and money going out of the government. According to the Ministry of Finance, home resales were up 9.7% last year and the average price was up 22.3% province-wide. Between real estate, construction, and banking and finance, a full 30% of the Ontario economy is tied up directly or indirectly in a hot housing market. Real estate, rental and leasing was a leading sector in real GDP growth in the province last year.", "These are numbers that the government confirmed in the budget when it admitted that it took in hundreds of millions of dollars in additional land transfer tax revenue last year. It’s a bubble so big you could leave Willy Wonka’s factory in it.", "Last year, the province’s Environmental Commissioner said, “Land use planning and development is really Ontario’s oil sands.” I’m saying all of this to prove a point this morning. When the commodity price on oil hit the skids, it blew a multi-billion-dollar hole through the middle of that province’s books. Alberta is still experiencing record unemployment levels.", "Leveraging the province’s fiscal state on a single sector of the economy, which the Ontario government has very much done in this budget when it comes to the real estate sector, is a dangerous proposition for all Ontarians. The finance minister and the Minister of Economic Development get up and they crow about the state of the province’s economy daily, but the reality is that our books are founded on quicksand, not rock.", "It’s a perfect storm of record-low interest rates for a decade, a strong American economy and a weak dollar. If you remove a single factor there, this all comes down really fast. If you have interest rates like we did in the 1990s, you’ll pull a lot of demand out of the housing market and you’ll end up with a lot of house-poor people who bought when the rates were really low, and that 30% of the economy tied into the real estate sector starts to face a major stress test. The prosperity the government talks about is nothing more than a mirage. We aren’t more productive. We’re just printing cheap money, and we have been for a long time.", "If I could move on from housing to energy, as the energy critic, I’d like to take a couple of issues close to my portfolio and expose the government’s mismanagement when it to the province’s asset sales strategy. In this budget, the government counted over $2 billion in increased asset sales revenue from two years ago. Roughly 60% of that increase is the sale of Hydro One shares. The rest is cobbled together from a number of real estate transactions, including the sale of Ontario Power Generation headquarters just south of Queen’s Park, at College and University; the Seaton and Lakeview lands, and a few other transactions that took place as well.", "The Hydro One sale is resoundingly unpopular in this House and across the province. We all know that. Opposition members found out from talking to people. The cabinet found out from talking to their pollster David Herle, but at least we can all agree on the fact that sale of Hydro One is extremely unpopular.", "The thing is, you can’t balance the budget and call it a balanced budget with the one-time sale of assets. It’s an artificial balance because the government isn’t dealing with the structural issues in the province of Ontario.", "You can only sell Hydro One once, and as we learned late Monday night, the government has already sold off more than 50% of what was once a public power entity in Hydro One. That’s done. It’s over. You can’t count on that money again. You book the money once. Unless you’re going to keep selling, you can’t double-count the money. You can’t do it. Although, as I said earlier, we’re dealing with a Liberal government, and it wouldn’t be the first time that they double-counted money. We’ve seen that in budgets year after year.", "Just before I finish, I’d like to touch on something that should have been in the budget but wasn’t, and that was the government’s electricity debt financing scheme. Page 216 of the document reads as follows: “Under PSAS”—the public sector accounting standards—“the results of government business enterprises are required to be reflected on the province’s financial statements based on international financial reporting standards (IFRS). As of April 1, 2016, the province will consolidate the results of those two rate-regulated entities as they would be reported under IFRS.... The entities themselves will continue to issue financial statements prepared on a US” generally accepted accounting principles-basis.", "For the last 20 years, we’ve generally held electricity debt in the province at the Ontario Electric Financial Corp., or the OEFC. Now, you may or may not like that, but the reason that we’ve done that is to make the province accountable for the debt that it incurs there, to make it transparent. What page 216 admits is that part of the reason that the government is about to bury over $25 billion in principal debt and another $25 billion in interest at Ontario Power Generation is so that the province doesn’t have to account for it; it becomes OPG’s problem. Really what it becomes is a problem for electricity customers in the province of Ontario down the road.", "This year, 62 days—make that probably 70 days now—after the government announcement of their rate-scheme plan, we still don’t have legislation on how they intend to do that. A $1-billion equity injection had to be made by the province to kick-start the process, and that was in the budget, but what we didn’t see is legislation in the budget, and we still haven’t seen legislation in this House, as to how they are going to deal with this $50 billion in debt that ultimately should be represented in the province’s budget, but it’s not. It’s being hidden over at OPG.", "The $1 billion, according to finance bureaucrats in the lock-up, is reflected in the debt line for the province. So the $1 billion is there to get the program started; the other $49 billion is nowhere to be seen, which tells you all you need to know about this scheme. The government could debt-finance rate reduction on its own books. By the admission to public servants, not to mention the Ontario Energy Board’s own rate report release of April 20, that’s what it’s already doing. It’s creating the rate reduction mechanism at OPG so that it can get away with keeping it off its balance sheet. Otherwise, we’d see a growing debt at OEFC, and we’d have to move Hydro One sale money over there to finance it.", "So we’re not seeing where the latest tranche of OPG shares that was sold on Monday is going to end up, but you can imagine that it’s probably not going to be used to build infrastructure in the province of Ontario. It’s probably going to be used to show that they’re trying to balance next year’s budget as well. It’s not going to where it’s intended to be going, and our finance critic has done an outstanding job at explaining where that money is actually going. It’s going to trick the people of Ontario into believing that this government is a prudent manager of the province’s finances, when clearly it’s not doing that. It’s not going to pay for infrastructure, as the ministers would like you to believe, as the Ontario Liberal government would like you to believe. It’s going to create an artificial balance of the books in the province of Ontario, and it’s right there in the budget book if you actually go and take the time to read it.", "So, the House is asked to review the government’s general fiscal direction. The budget presented lacks substantial costing figures for its central promise. It lacks any kind of recognition of the risks to Ontario’s economy. It finances new operating costs on the back of one-time revenue, and it employs accounting tricks to bury a mountain of new debt to avoid immediately servicing it.", "We know this government’s track record when it comes to health care and education and energy, and I could go on and on and list all of the ministries. The House expects—the House is asked, with 30 minutes of debate shared, to approve all this? Speaker, it simply can’t do that, and we won’t. Thank you for your time this morning." ],

It sees consultation, it sees openness, as an inconvenience, something that, really, they’re not interested in. Seriously, they’re not interested in hearing the will of the people.", "So it’s no wonder that they don’t want extended debate or consultations on this budget. For one moment, Speaker, let’s look at the impact of this budget on the city of Toronto. The mayor of Toronto was very clear. He said this budget turns its back on the city, and frankly, there are two areas where I think we need to consider this.", "The first is that this budget doesn’t provide money to help deal with the backlog of repairs at Toronto Community Housing. The city had proposed a one-third, one-third, one-third share between the city, the federal government, and the province to deal with those outstanding problems. The province has no money in the budget to deal with that. What that means is that hundreds, if not thousands, of units will be closed to people who desperately need that affordable housing. This is on top of the millions of dollars that this government has cut from the allocation for housing over the past few years.", "If people are worried about homelessness, if people are worried about families who are in desperate circumstances, living in cramped accommodations that they can’t afford, turn to this government, because when the crisis came in this city, this government turned its back.", "The mayor of Toronto also talked about the abandonment of Toronto’s needs for help with mass transit. In particular, the funding is not there to proceed with the relief line. If you’re stuck on the Yonge subway and you can’t get on a train in the next few years because it’s already packed, think of Kathleen Wynne and the Liberal government in this province. They turned their back on Toronto with this budget. They can give whatever protestation they want, but in the end, the city of Toronto will have more homelessness and more gridlock because this budget ignores its real needs. It ignores its real needs.", "Speaker, this budget bill before us is supposed to be about the budget. Interestingly, one of the schedules deals with the legislation in Ontario that regulates oil and gas extraction—and there actually is an oil and gas industry in Ontario. It’s pretty small, but it’s there. Within the last 12 months or so, I introduced a bill to stop fracking or ban fracking in Ontario, and I was told at the time by the relevant minister that there was no need to have such a bill because, in fact, the rules didn’t allow it.", "Well, the rules are being rewritten in a budget bill. It has nothing do with this province’s expenses. Rules are being rewritten in a way that’s not clear. Will in fact this allow fracking in Ontario? That’s not certain at this point. It’s buried in the bill. It has nothing to do with the budget. It’s a very convenient way of putting through something that could be extraordinarily controversial without actually having to come out and say, “We’re changing the rules on gas and oil extraction in Ontario. Get ready for people to start injecting fluids into the rocks under your homes in southwestern Ontario. Get ready for that.”", "Speaker, that alone is a bill that should stand on its own and have full public consultation and full explanation. So it’s no surprise that this government doesn’t want to have extended consultation, extended debate on this budget.", "Speaker, as you’re well aware, Ontario is at a tipping point. This province has been made unstable by this government. It’s getting harder and harder to build a good life in Ontario. It’s getting harder and harder to get ahead. Costs are up, wages are flat and services we count on, like health care and education, are squeezed. If we don’t make substantial changes soon—and this budget will not make those changes—we should have real worry about what will happen to our children and their children in the decades to come. Because increasingly, if you’re in your 20s and 30s, it is extraordinarily difficult to get a decent job, a long-term job, one that pays enough to actually establish a life. Too many young people in my riding and across Ontario are forced to live with their parents because they can’t get the income they need to set up their own lives.", "For Ontarians who are waiting for a $15 minimum wage, this budget is silent. For 85% of Ontarians who want a publicly owned Hydro One, this budget just continues the process of taking the one-time money from the sell-off of an asset that this province built over a century. It takes that one-time money to make the books look good. And that’s it; that is the sum total of it.", "For millions of Ontarians without drug coverage—this bill, although it introduces a drug plan that will be useful to some people, for millions, they’re simply left out. They have no coverage at all. They will have to wait for a change of government to actually get the pharmacare they need.", "This budget does not undo the damage that’s been caused by the Liberals over their rule of this province since 2003. It’s been a long time. A lot of damage has accumulated. This budget will not correct that. In the end, it’s the “I’m sorry” budget. It’s too late; it’s too little. It actually isn’t going to deal with the problems that we face.", "I want to speak a bit about the impact of this budget on health care. The highlighted announcement is drug coverage for our children and young people. In itself, that’s not a bad thing. It’s inadequate, but in itself, it’s not a bad thing. But we actually need a much broader, bolder, more comprehensive program that covers the millions of people who have no drug benefits at all right now—none. What’s to be done for them? Frankly, with this budget, nothing. They’re on their own. They are left to deal with problems as best they can—and we pay for that. We pay in the ill health of friends and relatives who can’t afford the medications they need, and we pay for it because they will wind up in emergency rooms and in hospital beds, dealing with the consequences of not having had that medication. It will add to our health care costs. It will slow down health care in this province. We will all pay for a lack of action on their part.", "Hospital funding will leave many hospitals forced to continue cutting costs. The promised increase of 3% for the sector and a 2% minimum for each hospital is below what’s needed, according to the Ontario Hospital Association. The increase is over $300 million less than what is needed to actually put our hospitals on a sound financial footing.", "This government can talk about the money that it’s putting in. It’s taken so much out, it’s put the health care system in such a difficult position that even with what they’ve put in this budget, the situation in hospitals is going to fall short of what it needs to be, and people will pay for that. People will pay with their health. They’ll pay with lost years of life. It will have consequences.", "What they’ve done does not undo the damage of fired nurses, cancelled surgeries and overcrowded emergency rooms. We’ve had questions raised in the House about people going into hospitals that were so packed, they weren’t allowed to get a bed; they were put up in the television room or forced to sleep in the shower or forced to sleep in a hallway. This is not going to correct that. It’s not even going to take the major first step that’s needed to correct that.", "For education, nothing in here to undo the damage to our schools. Speaker, go into schools in your community, go into the schools across this province, and you’ll see the results of neglect, of underfunding of capital repairs that make the schools more expensive to operate, and ultimately, more expensive to repair later. If you don’t correct a leaking roof now, you’re going to have a lot more plaster, drywall and structural issues to deal with later.", "Fifteen boards will see special education cuts of $4.6 million. That alone is an extraordinary thing to be able to say about a budget. The money that we need on child care—it’s not there; nothing new to deal with the child care crisis in this province.", "It’s no surprise to me that this government doesn’t want to have a long debate or public consultation on its budget.

Frankly, while the opposition is playing those procedural games, we’re taking action and we’re moving forward.", "The alternative would be letting the opposition continue with its procedural tactics to delay and drag out this process, as they’ve done in the past. I won’t support that. Those of us on this side won’t support that sort of thing.", "This is a budget that’s designed to help the people of Ontario, and we need to move forward with that. The people of Ontario want us to move forward with that as quickly as possible and get on with the work. The fact that the PCs are using this procedural motion and now arguing that we should move things along is disappointing, to say the least.", "The member of the PC caucus who spoke raised a number of issues. I won’t address them all, but one of the things that he talked about was the fact that—he suggested that somehow we don’t want to look at this bill in detail. If this bill goes to committee, it can be looked at in detail, just as other bills are. Again, if the reasoned amendment hadn’t been brought forward by the PCs, then we wouldn’t be in this position, so we’d have even more time.", "He talked about how, when government bills get brought forward, we, the government, sometimes bring forward many amendments, make many amendments to the bill. How is that a bad thing? That’s an indication that the government is listening and trying to make the bill as good as it can possibly be. So to make out that us listening to the people of Ontario who are impacted by legislation and then adjusting to try to make the legislation as strong as possible, I think, is disappointing—and it’s a little worrisome that that member wants to be in government and then doesn’t want to, presumably, amend legislation that he might bring forward or his government would bring forward. So it’s disappointing.", "The member opposite talked, again, like the other members of the PC caucus have done over the past several days, about the fact this is—they’ve argued that this is not truly a balanced budget, because they argue about the cap-and-trade revenues that are being brought in as a result of this budget. Let’s be frank about that. The cap-and-trade revenues are not being used to balance the budget. Those revenues are dedicated to specific projects, so there are expenses tied to that revenue. We aren’t using the proceeds of asset sales to balance.", "If you look in this document and you look back over past fiscal years, every year, governments—Liberal, PC or NDP—are constantly in the process of either buying infrastructure and assets, buying capital or selling capital. When you sell capital, due to the way it’s accounted for under the accounting rules, there can be a gain on the sale of an asset. Certainly this year, like in past years, those gains are there. But to suggest that’s how we balanced the budget is to ignore the fact—and I wish the opposition were just honest with people about that.", "There’s mention of—", "Interjections." ],

They reaffirm that the way we accounted for it this year was the same as we accounted for in the past, and that is the appropriate way to account for things. I just wanted to mention those points because I think that raising those points and suggesting that there’s some sort of game being played here is really disappointing.", "The other thing I will say is that I want to read from an article that was written about this very topic.

Because it’s a stupid question.” That’s what David Reevely writes in the Toronto Sun.", "It’s very clear that this line of attack by the PCs is really, in my view, a sign that they can’t find something of substance to criticize so they’re telling a story that they’re hoping people buy into about how we’ve somehow falsely balanced the budget.", "I have worked in business most of my career. I’ve advised large companies on how to invest their money. I’ve studied economics. I’ve studied accounting. I’ve studied finance. I know a balanced budget when I see one.

The vast majority of new projects that are being funded in the city of Toronto—the Eglinton Crosstown, the UP Express, the Scarborough subway, SmartTrack, the streetcars—for all of these new projects that are being built in the city of Toronto, the vast majority of that funding is coming from the provincial government. We have supported transit in Toronto like no government ever has in the past. So to suggest that somehow we’re shortchanging Toronto is incredibly disappointing to me. Hopefully the member understands that he stands corrected.", "The member from the NDP talked about school funding, that there’s a lack of school funding. He talked about the need to build more schools and the fact that we need more funding for school boards, to operate the education system.", "I have good news for the member opposite. I have good news for the member for Toronto–Danforth. That’s exactly what this budget is proposing. This budget is proposing $16 billion over 10 years for school infrastructure. That’s new schools in communities across this province. There is an additional $6.4 billion over three years for operating funding to fund the education system. I just wanted to make sure that the members were aware of that.", "The member talked about how there’s a lack of funding for child care. I’m a little surprised. I’m standing here by the minister, who has been working so hard on this file. The government has committed through this budget—and previously, frankly—to 100,000 new child care spaces for the people of Ontario; 24,000, if I’m not mistaken, in the upcoming year.", "These are significant investments that are going to make a difference for people and make health care more accessible.", "I wanted to make sure that those points stood corrected so that we are basing our discussion on what is in this budget and how it’s going to help the people of Ontario.", "Speaker, I want to highlight a few other elements of this budget that I think are of fundamental importance.", "For me, one of the highlights of this budget is health care. I represent a riding, Etobicoke Centre, which has one of the highest percentages of seniors of any riding in the country, so one of the things that I hear about from members of my community a lot, whether it be from seniors or those folks who are caring for their aging parents or grandparents, is how we can improve our health care system. When I look at this budget, it demonstrates that we’re trying to make that a priority. We’ve got a $7-billion booster shot for the health care system—the OHIP+ pharmacare program for young people under 25, making over 4,400 prescription drugs free, starting January 1, 2018. There are four million young people under the age of 25 who are going to benefit from this, and they’ll know that all those pharmaceutical drugs I just talked about are going to be covered. In addition, this helps families, because very often, especially for the younger children, those prescription drugs are paid for through their parents. This is going to help those families. I’m excited about that measure and how it helps families.", "We’re going to have $9 billion over 10 years to build hospitals. That’s incredible, when you think about what that will do for access to care in communities across the province. In Etobicoke—and the member for Etobicoke–Lakeshore is here, and I know the member for Etobicoke North is very proud of this, too—Etobicoke General Hospital is in the process of being expanded significantly. That’s just one example of how communities are going to be benefited by these types of investments. I’m really excited about that.", "There’s $5 billion in new money just for operating funds for hospitals. So we’re not just building new facilities and infrastructure, but we’re also supporting the operation of those facilities.", "A few other quick highlights that I think are particularly relevant, especially to my constituents in Etobicoke Centre—the new OSAP. We’re now going to have 210,000 young and mature students who are going to get access to free tuition. I think that’s really exciting. I had a youth advisory group last night, and the focus of the conversation was financial literacy. One of the issues that came up was the need to think about how to plan for your post-secondary education. The speaker who was at this meeting presented the fact that the new OSAP will do what I just talked about. Some of the young people knew about it, but some of them didn’t. They were really excited about that. She talked about how that’s going to impact their financial future. It’s really exciting.", "The Career Kick-Start Strategy will help young people get experience in the field that they’re studying. That’s incredibly powerful and impactful. As someone who struggled to get his first job coming out of post-secondary, I know what that’s like. This will be life-changing for a lot of young people. It’s an important step.", "The member opposite talked about housing. We’ve made significant investments in housing across Ontario and in the city of Toronto, so to suggest that we’re shortchanging Toronto is simply not right.", "There are a number of measures to help seniors: the transit tax credit; the investments in long-term care; the dementia strategy, which I’m incredibly excited about. As a PA, Minister Naidoo-Harris, who is sitting next to me, was in charge of travelling the province and consulting with people on the dementia strategy. In fact, she came to my riding, Etobicoke Centre, to hear from my constituents. Those are examples. That dementia strategy is something that we desperately need.", "I could go on and on, Speaker.", "I’m incredibly proud of this budget, not just because of all these measures that will touch the lives of the people of Ontario, but because we’re able do this because we’ve balanced the budget. We’ve balanced the budget as a result of two major factors: one is a strong economy that has grown, that has allowed us to invest; but also because we’ve taken a solid, sound approach to balancing the budget, finding savings in the budget and doing it in a methodical way—not the slash-and-burn approach of the PCs, not the 100,000-job-cut approach. We went methodically, program by program, through the government’s finances to find savings, and I’m incredibly proud of that.", "The last thing I would say is that when I see members of the opposition, and I’m referring to the PC Party, stand up and talk about how we need to pay down debt—“You should be paying down debt; we need to reduce the interest rates”—okay.

They issued it in February, if you remember. This year, we started the finance committee early and finished in the middle of January, and they issued the budget in the last week of April, almost May. Then they turn around and try to blame us because we’re holding it up. This is just what they do.", "They talk about how, yes, we have some projects we’d like to do, but just consider for a second that when they came into power, the revenue the government was collecting, I guess under the former Ernie Eves budget, was about $65 billion. This government is collecting over $130 billion, almost $70 billion more each year. Yes, there’s money for projects, but we would not spend the money on scandals like the gas plants. You talk about the UP Express and the over-expenditures this government has done. Everything they do is over budget and delayed. And what do they do? How do they fix that? They usually give the person a bonus. So if you’re working for the government and you want to get a bonus, just fail and you get a bonus. That’s what this government has done.", "There are just so many things you look at here. We talk about the recent school issue with the closures. From a financial point of view, they’ve got a situation here that’s a real mess, and not just in my riding; I share it with Grant Crack, the member from Glengarry–Prescott–Russell. In Alexandria, we’ve got five schools that are all less than 50% full. So what are we going do, close them all? That’s the current plan.", "The worst thing is that students in my riding who grew up across the road from where I live—we’re about an hour south of Alexandria by bus. You go to Alexandria, but there’s no school for you, because there’s no English public school there. You’d have to go to Laggan, which is another 20 minutes or half an hour by bus. You’re talking about almost an hour and a half on the bus to get to the closest English Catholic school, and you’re driving by five schools that are all half full. We have to look at what we’re doing here.", "The promise here is, “Well, close a few more schools and we’ll build a new one.” Look at the cost of that. If we’re going to build infrastructure, let’s put some priorities around the infrastructure and decide what we’re going to do. Yes, education is very important, but let’s bring some of the numbers together. It’s not working. When you take a small population and you divide it in four, it doesn’t work.", "In our area, when you look at the English Catholic school board in just the five counties—Stormont, Dundas, Glengarry, Prescott and Russell—they have a third of the students. That’s unusual in this province. It’s probably the only place where that happens, except maybe the city of Ottawa. So you’re talking about three boards—the two major boards and the French public board, which is much smaller—sharing the remainder of those students. I think it’s something, and the public is demanding that we look at it. But with this budget we have no time to debate because we’re looking at—imagine if you come all of the way to Toronto and you get five minutes to speak in a delegation, one day. How is that a democracy? And what do they do? They turn around and they blame the opposition. Let’s look at the timing here.", "There are so many problems in this province that we have to look at. Health care: Our only hospital back in Cornwall—it’s in the Toronto Star—138% of capacity. We’ve got people lying on stretchers in hospital hallways, empty offices—anywhere they can find. This is not a one-time occurrence; this happens every spring. Since I’ve been here, they’ve asked for more facilities. I go back to my first year here. It was so bad, they had to create 32 spaces over in the old general hospital, and they were bragging that no, it’s time—“We have the facilities; we’re going to get rid of them. We don’t really need them.” I guess it was a mistake that they created them.", "So we looked into them and when we talked to the CCAC, what we were told was just ludicrous. They were trying to tell us that when they crunched their numbers we had more existing beds today without the 32 than we would need in 2030. So you’re sitting there, and I go back, “Well, you know, there are two things here: First of all, the Auditor General said we have the worst wait times in the province, over three years’ wait times.” And now you’re telling me that due to population projections, the population doubles. The seniors population doubles by 2030, so we have double the beds that we actually need.", "How can that be? We have the worst record, and double the facilities. So really, by their numbers, half of our beds should be empty. And they said, “Well, that’s what our numbers show,” but those are the numbers that this government gives out. They just don’t make sense. But they’re the holders of the information, the holders of the projections. People like to believe what they’re hearing from the government, but they’re getting tired of it. They’re looking at the results; they look at that 138%.", "Normally the hospitals wouldn’t say anything. I’ve witnessed them myself, actually, a group of people being warned by the government saying, “If you embarrass us, don’t expect—next year will be worse.” If you talk to these groups, if you talk to Community Living or you talk to hospitals, they’re told that all of the time, so you never hear anything from the hospitals.", "After the last election—surprise, surprise—we heard that there have been no increases in the hospital budget for four years. Now, what agency would you not give an increase to for one or two years, and not hear something? Four years in a row, and not a word to the public because they’re intimidated; it’s an attitude. It’s just something in the way that they operate that next year could be worse.", "We’ve asked that question of a group of social services, and that’s what they’re told. They said that if there’s a negative news article, “We’d better know about it the day before, and next year will be worse. So all we do, as hydro rates go up and as wages go up, we silently cut people. That’s all we can do.” You look in North Bay, where they’ve cut hundreds of nurses. That’s what this government is doing.", "They sit here and they now want to cut off debate, because I guess they don’t like these stories. There are people who actually sit down and listen to what goes on in the House, and they hear these stories. That’s what’s happening in our ridings. I look at the talk about some of the things that we’ve got going here. They have the children’s aid bill that they’re trying to push. They can’t say we’re debating it, that we’re delaying things, because it’s the government that has over 200 amendments in it. We’ve been waiting since 2012 for a bill. They come through, they finally put it through, and obviously it looks very rushed. They introduced it last year, and now they’re trying to push it. The government puts in 200 amendments, almost double what the total opposition put in. Do they not know what’s going on here? How could that be?", "And everything we do is about cutting off delegations. We tried to get the delegations able to speak for a reasonable amount of time—couldn’t get that. They say they want to hear from the public, but just as we hear here, five minutes. Somebody that comes from my riding, if you drive it’s about a five-hour drive, maybe five and a half hours depending on the traffic, and you’re given five minutes to speak on something that they say is crucial to the province.", "What have we not seen so far? We haven’t seen legislation on the hydro plan. Will that be rushed through? We’ve been waiting ever since this House first came back in February, when they finally realized that there’s a problem in this province with hydro costs—nothing. We’re sitting back here with two legislative weeks left and no legislation. I imagine it will be introduced—maybe it’s an election budget. It will say, “Look, if you don’t vote for us, we’ll never get this legislation through, because we didn’t get time to get it through before the session ended.” It’s mind-boggling what’s going on here.", "The members say that we’re always asking for things. Yes, we are asking for things. We’re asking for a better job from this government. A government that takes in that amount of money every year—imagine, $70 billion a year. Yes, we’re asking for $200 million for a hospital. That’s a small amount when you look at the total you’re collecting.", "But the real question is, where are you spending the $70 billion? Because the budget was balanced before—I know I’m slightly over my time. I remember when I was newly elected mayor of South Glengarry, the MPP went around the first year of the budget and they spent $3 billion in the last week of March of that year, 2004. The word was, “The money is flowing, but it’s going to come out at the end of March. We can’t get the cheques all delivered because we’re so busy getting to the photo ops.” You can imagine: $3 billion unbudgeted. They stood here and they said, “Wow, Ernie Eves’s budget overspent.”", "They took power in October. So how much money did they spend? They promised they wouldn’t raise taxes; the first thing was they put the health tax in. But $3 billion in one week just for transfers to the municipal governments—now, I know they collected that back as they cut funding by $100 million over the last couple of years, but it’s just sad when you look at what’s going on. And then we hear that type of talk over there.", "Let’s stand up for Ontario. Let’s be honest with people and let’s tell people what we’re really spending here. It’s a waste of time." ],

They were angry about Ornge and the loss of life and the loss of investment. They were angry about the $8 billion that Infrastructure Ontario overspent in the great promise of infrastructure investment in the province of Ontario—but Bay Street did very well through those deals.", "I think there was genuinely a sense of scandal fatigue. They were cynical; they were disappointed. Those big numbers, like $1.1 billion—that’s a lot of money. But today, they get a hydro bill, and because of the decisions that have been made by this government on the energy file—from fully privatizing green energy in the province of Ontario, signing contracts with independent private companies at 36 cents per kilowatt hour when the competitive rate was six or eight cents.", "When the Auditor General says that to date we have spent $37 billion more than we ever needed to, to bring in green energy in the province of Ontario—these numbers are so big. But on the energy file, people open their hydro bill every month. They are doing everything—they’re doing their laundry in the middle of the night. They’ve changed their light bulbs. They’ve retrofitted their house. And still, their hydro bills have gone up 300% in this province. They are mad, and they have every right to be mad.", "What does this government do with this budget? They double down on selling off Hydro One. They have not listened to the emotion, to the pain that the people have experienced. We have brought those stories to this Legislature, as is our responsibility to do, about the people who are choosing to heat or eat, about the businesses that are leaving the province of Ontario because the time-of-use high energy costs have pushed them out of this province to go to more competitive jurisdictions.", "We have seen the loss of jobs and we’ve seen the loss of income and we’ve seen the loss of revenue, quite honestly, to this place. We have seen people make devastating decisions. We have seen the cost of hydro affect health care in the province of Ontario. I will never forget the CEO of a hospital in Windsor saying that his hydro costs for that hospital had gone up $7 million over the year. He said, “We can’t cut anything more. We can’t do anything more without hurting people.” That was his plea in 2015 to our finance committee, because I used to travel around the province, and it was our responsibility to bring that lived experience back to this place.", "But what does this government do? In this budget, they commit to continue to sell off Hydro One. They’ve lost the majority of the shares. This energy minister is bragging about the fact that the oversight isn’t there anymore and that the government doesn’t really have the majority to actually do anything about hydro. They have left hydro costs in the province of Ontario up to those who are in their interest—their interest as a private for-profit company is to make money; it isn’t to deliver energy at a cost that is acceptable to the people of this province.", "I have to tell you, the response after the last tranche sell-off on Monday was swift. Today in the Toronto Sun—I’m going to bring these voices to the Legislature, as is my responsibility to do—Fred Hahn says, “Let me be clear. On behalf of our union, on behalf of the tens of thousands of Ontarians who are part of the Keep Hydro Public Coalition—we will continue to fight against the sale of Hydro One until the Liberals stop this wrongheaded plan, both in the courts and on the ground.” And they are in court.

It requires, as we have proposed, sustainable funding in a rational and a reliable model—one third, one third, one third—and that is what we have made the commitment to.", "But today in the Toronto Star: “Mayor John Tory is threatening to stop planning work on a transit project favoured by the province unless Queen’s Park commits money to build the relief line subway.", "“Speaking at a press conference Tuesday morning in Riverdale, Tory said he was considering blocking progress on the Yonge subway extension, which would extend the TTC’s Line 1 (Yonge-University-Spadina) subway into York region.", "“The project has the backing of local politicians north of Toronto, including influential Liberal cabinet ministers in Premier Kathleen Wynne’s government.” This is a line in the sand, but that line keeps getting deeper and deeper, Mr. Speaker.", "The article goes on to say, “The mayor said his job was to alleviate crowding on the transit system, ‘not to make it worse.’", "“‘The Yonge Street north extension will only add more passengers to the Yonge Street subway, and without relief, I can’t allow that to happen.’” That’s today’s Toronto Star article by Ben Spurr, the transportation reporter, who very clearly outlines that this budget does nothing for the city of Toronto to alleviate the pressure. If you travel on the TTC in this city, as I do, redefining yourself as a sardine happens pretty quickly when you get into those cars, Mr. Speaker.", "So the mayor has signalled to those members across, the Liberal members from the GTA, from the 905, that this budget does nothing to help them with the social housing backlog or with the maintenance of our current housing stock, which will leave 1,000 units closed in this city. It does nothing to help him plan to alleviate the pressure on the transit system, which gets people to and from their workplaces, which connects our productivity as a city. And quite honestly, to double down on the sell-off of Hydro One, Mr. Speaker, is unconscionable. The people of this province are mad as hell, and they’re not going to take it anymore.", "It is not a budget that can be supported. Shame on this government for time-allocating it. Shame on you for limiting the voices of the people of this province so that they don’t get to clearly articulate their disappointment and their sense of betrayal from this government, because this budget will not undo the damage of 14 years of Liberal government in Ontario. It’s our job to hold you to account, but you are limiting our ability to do so, and that’s a sad day for this Legislature." ],

It says this: “While the term ’time allocation’ connotes ideas of time management more than it does closure, a motion to allocate time may be used as a guillotine by the government.” That’s exactly what we’re seeing today: This motion is being used as a guillotine for debate by the government.", "Speaker, as the corrections critic, I was saddened to see that the words “probation” and “parole” were nowhere to be found in the corrections section of this bill. The only reference made to the safety of inmates and staff dealing with increasing assaults in our jails was actually buried away in the very last sentence of the section, in a throwaway line.", "There is also no mention of any budgeted spending for new jails. Now, imagine our surprise when a few days later—still no details whatsoever—the government announced that it was in fact going to build two new jails, one in Ottawa and one in Thunder Bay. The location—I’m referencing the one in Ottawa—is unknown. The cost is unknown. The timeline is unknown. I eagerly await the details of these announced projects to emerge and will be following along closely as they do.", "At the same time, we are somewhat concerned about the thought of this Liberal government building another jail.

This dangerous situation has been flagged for this government not only by members of the opposition dating back several years, but by front-line staff and even the Auditor General.", "Despite these clear warnings, the individuals tasked with critical responsibilities such as assessing the risk of sex offenders simply cannot keep up with the work. This crisis in community corrections, due to overloaded officers, jeopardizes public safety first and foremost, but also negatively impacts probation and parole officers, who realize a tragedy is waiting to happen, and even offenders who are trying to turn their lives around.", "Probation and parole officer caseloads are amongst the highest in the nation, and each case requires a massive amount of paperwork—that’s code for “red tape”—that is keeping our officers out of the community.", "Given the lack of progress on this critical issue, and the government’s unwillingness—or shall I say inability—to address it, the official opposition has asked Ontario’s Ombudsman to step in and investigate the broken probation and parole system.", "The official opposition made five budget requests.

These measures include: stop signing contracts for power we don’t need—and I can certainly indicate and tell this Legislature of a number of projects in the riding of Chatham–Kent–Essex where we don’t need those signed contracts; dismantle the Green Energy Act; stop the fire sale of Hydro One; and rein in exorbitant executive compensation in energy.", "That was the second ask.", "The third ask was simply solutions to addressing Ontario’s housing crisis, including evidence-based measures to address both supply and demand, the establishment of a panel of industry experts and an immediate review of the government portfolio.", "Fourthly, we were asking for immediately making cap-and-trade revenue-neutral, where any money generated is returned to hard-working Ontarians.", "Lastly, our fifth ask was an immediate moratorium on school closures and an immediate review of the flawed Pupil Accommodation Review Guideline that determines these closures.", "Although the government ignored each of these requests, we will continue to push for these issues.", "On one hand, the Liberal government claims this is a balanced budget.

This is something to keep in mind as troubling reports keep emerging of a complete lack of oversight of offenders within our communities due to this government’s appalling track record on community safety.", "The Auditor General has also expressed concerns with questionable Liberal accounting practices. The artificially balanced budget includes over $500 million in pension assets which Ontario’s Auditor General specifically did not authorize, and the Liberals have in fact ignored the Auditor General and are counting this money to falsely claim that they have a balanced budget. We know that facts still matter. This is not a balanced budget. There is more than a $5-billion operational deficit that the government is hiding through cash grabs, unauthorized use of pension assets and one-time revenue, such as the fire sale of Hydro One.", "On the sale of Hydro One, it is truly outrageous that this government claims that it must sell off Hydro One to pay for infrastructure. Governments of all stripes were able to get through World Wars I and II, the Great Depression, booms and busts through the 20th century and still build infrastructure without resorting to sell off our province’s crown jewel. They’re selling the farm to pay the bills.", "Speaking of farms, Mr. Speaker, the many people in my area and in the agricultural industry are a very integral part of the economy and we’re very disappointed that Ontario’s agriculture or agri-food budget is being cut by $47 million. Given the lack of detail surrounding several announced measures that were mysteriously absent from the budget, we had hoped that the government would allow for more meaningful debate. Sadly, here we are debating the fact that the Liberal government wants to slam the window shut for debate on their budget. It’s clear they just don’t want to answer to anyone anymore.", "Speaker, as I conclude my remarks, I want to simply say that on yet another time allocation motion brought forward by this government, I will offer one closing thought. This attitude towards governance and an unwillingness to listen to the growing number of Ontarians who disagree with Liberal decisions may end up being this government’s downfall." ],

Maybe. At present, the compensation act bars claims for mental stress. The government’s label for mental illness caused by work that isn’t preceded by a physical injury—so there has to be some physical trauma that causes mental stress, with one narrow exception: You can only get benefits if your mental stress is an acute reaction to a sudden and unexpected traumatic event arising out of the course of your employment.", "For example, when I was working for the Ontario Nurses’ Association, we had a nurse who was taken hostage by a psychiatric patient at the Niagara Falls hospital. She was awarded benefits, but it took a while to get those benefits awarded.", "Three years ago, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal ruled that the bar on chronic mental stress claims is discriminatory and violates the charter, but the government took no action on that for three long years. Part of this bill that’s in the budget bill—and I don’t know why it’s in the budget bill or why it isn’t out there on its own, because it is very important to many workers in this province. But anyway, if the proposed budget legislation passes, which we know it will because we have a majority government, it will amend the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act to remove the unconstitutional provisions.", "However, there’s a poison pill. There’s always a poison pill when the Liberals table legislation. Although a worker will now be entitled to benefits under the insurance plan for chronic or traumatic mental stress arising out of and in the course of the worker’s employment, they have not removed subsection 13(5), which says that a worker is not entitled to benefits for mental stress caused by decisions or actions of the worker’s employer relating to the worker’s employment, “including a decision to change the work to be performed or the working conditions, to discipline the worker or to terminate the employment.”", "I know, having represented nurses for more than 20 years in their workplaces, that many times the failure of employers—hospital employers, community health employers, nursing homes—to actually address the stress in the workplace, whether it was the workload—people having to work many, many hours of overtime because of lack of staffing; having to work short-staffed; having to deal with emergencies in their workplace—or the employers’ failure to address bullying or harassment in the workplace by physicians against nurses or employee-to-employee harassment actually leads to the discipline or the termination that now continues to be part of whether or not you get benefits for mental stress. Although they fixed one thing, they failed to actually fix the other piece.", "In addition to removing that, they’ve added another poison pill. That poison pill is that it licenses WSIB to make policies setting different evidentiary requirements and adjudicative principles for different types of entitlement. So if you break a leg or you hurt your back, there’s one set of rules. But if you have a mental health issue or a stress issue related to work that isn’t part of being disciplined or terminated, there are going to be different rules, but they haven’t set out what those rules are. They’re going to have to do that.", "The labour folks and the experts around compensation here in the province have some problems with that, because this is a significantly higher-threshold test for cause, as the significant contributing factor test that generally applies to any other type of illness or injury in the province. If adopted in Ontario, it would constitute a real, differential change. It would open the door for different interpretations and, probably, would reduce the number of claims that are actually reversed at the tribunal level. So it is problematic.", "As I said, there’s always a poison pill when we get these pieces of legislation. The government continues to embed these important pieces of legislation in the budget or in an omnibus bill, so that if you don’t vote for the entire bill, then they can say, at the end of the day, you’re not supporting this piece of legislation. I can tell you that we’re supporting a part of it, but we’re not supporting all of it.", "I’ve only got about a minute left, and I want to spend that time talking about Peterborough.

He passed away a year and a half before—he was diagnosed with mesothelioma. For some reason, he fell through the cracks—like, perhaps, people in many manufacturing places here in the province that are now closed. Twenty years later, we did the work and this woman has actually been approved for benefits. But she lived in poverty for 20 years. Her kids never got to go to college. She is 67 years old.

It’s something that the Liberals say that they don’t support, and yet they do it frequently.

We would start off with some essential drugs and expand that over time. It’s actually a very responsible way of doing it, I would think, to look at what people need right now, and then expand that over time; roll it in slowly, so that as more and more people have access to their medications and more people are taking them as they should, you see fewer and fewer people entering into the medical system, fewer doctors’ visits, fewer hospital visits, which is saving money. It’s money we can put back into our plan and increase the number of prescriptions that would be covered for people. That would be the responsible thing to do.", "But we caught the Liberals off guard, so they rushed it into their budget and made an announcement that they would cover anyone 24 and under. What’s interesting, though, is that nowhere in the budget is there a line that actually shows the money that they’ve committed to this pharmacare plan.

But at least then—maybe not now, but then, in 2014, they had the courage to actually run on what they truly believe in, which was selling off 100% of Hydro.", "The Liberals, on the other hand—in fact, the Premier said, “We will not sell off Hydro. We will not privatize.” She said that time and time again. None of them actually ran on it. Now it’s in the budget; now they’ve actually put it in the budget. The majority of people in this province do not approve of selling off that public asset. They’ve never, ever given the Liberals a mandate to sell off that asset. I can proudly stand here and say that New Democrats are the only party that have stood behind Ontarians and said, “We do not—don’t now, haven’t in the past, never will have supported the sell-off of our public hydro asset.”", "Conservatives can’t say the same thing; that’s a totally different story. The Liberals can’t say they ran on it—well, they do say they ran on it. I don’t know how to state this in a way without using a word you’re going to say is unparliamentary, but I don’t think anybody in this province would agree that the Liberals ran on selling off Hydro. I think that was a safe way of putting it, Speaker, and I appreciate your patience with that." ],

They’re not fooling the service providers that actually help those people with developmental disabilities. They get that there is nothing in this budget to actually address the indefinite wait-list for Passport funding. There’s nothing in here to truly open up appropriate supportive housing for these people.", "Yet, with all these people coming to Queen’s Park, talking about what isn’t in the budget and what supports they’re not getting—and some of this funding they’re saying they’re releasing for developmental services, they said they were releasing in 2014.

  "text" : [ "I’m very happy to have an opportunity this afternoon to spend a little bit of time, time that I will be sharing with my friend and colleague the Attorney General, with respect to the third reading of Bill 65.", "This is legislation that, a number of weeks ago, I was very proud to have brought forward with respect to making very critical sections of our roads, namely school zones and community safety zones, safer for some of our most vulnerable road users. In addition to that, we also, in this legislation, for example, move forward with making it administratively easier for those communities that wish to participate in our red-light camera program, another mechanism that has been now in existence for a number of years that’s also designed to help with respect to road safety, which is a critical issue for the Ministry of Transportation.", "I have said many times in this place and elsewhere that road safety, generally speaking, is the Ministry of Transportation’s top priority. In particular, we know that in communities right around Ontario, the safety of our most vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, particularly senior citizens, the elderly as they’re walking, and also school-aged children—that it was so important for us to move forward with this legislation, which, I should highlight, was requested by a number of municipalities, including municipalities like Ottawa, like the city of Toronto, and others, including my home region, York region.", "I think it’s also important for me to note that nothing in Bill 65 compels a municipality to move forward with any of the initiatives that I’ve just referenced or will reference in a second. It simply empowers them. If they want to take advantage of what we call automated speed enforcement or photo radar, they could do so if this legislation were to pass. Hopefully when it passes, they could do so, but only in school zones and community safety zones, as an example.", "It would also empower them, should they choose, to lower their default speed limit. We’ve heard from a number of municipalities that have told us, as have many of our road safety partners, that speed, particularly in areas like school zones and community safety zones, is very, very dangerous. Of course, I think that’s fairly intuitive.", "I want to stress, as I did at other points in debate, that when it comes to Bill 65, the motivation pure and simple for this government is to work with our municipal partners, law enforcement and other road safety partners to make sure that we empower them so that collectively we can provide for safer roads around schools and in community safety zones.", "There has been a lot of back and forth throughout the debate here in this chamber and at committee regarding this particular legislation. I have to admit I’m a little bit surprised that members of the Conservative caucus would have taken this opportunity to attempt to, in the first case, confuse the issue with respect to the legislation itself, and then, when they realized they had taken an untenable position, try and backtrack and force other initiatives into the legislation, initiatives that I’m happy to talk about. In fact, I’ve had the opportunity to speak to the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex and provide him with correspondence, because I recognize that the thrust of some of their initiatives are things that the Ministry of Transportation is quite happy to work with them on.", "But, tactically, I have to say that it is really unfortunate that the Leader of the Opposition and members of his caucus, both here in this chamber and at committee, would take this opportunity to try and suggest that Bill 65 contained provisions that in fact it did not really and truly contain, and to move forward in a particularly regrettable way.", "The good news is that we find ourselves here back at third reading on this legislation. I have to say, and I will say it: Throughout the debate at second reading, I heard the member from Kitchener–Conestoga, the member from Nipissing and the members from a number of other communities represented by Conservative MPPs debate extensively, as they should in this place, on this bill. In all of those cases, I heard references to a cash grab, I heard references to photo radar, I heard references to historic situations that existed in this province prior to 1995. Throughout the entirety of the debate, both myself and my staff were only able to find a couple of instances in which the notion of putting cameras on school buses to catch those who are not adhering to the rules was actually mentioned.", "That’s not to say that at an existential, philosophical level we disagree—that I disagree, as the minister—with moving forward in that direction. I’ve said that in this House, I’ve said it to media, and I’ve said it, frankly, to the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex. What I do find remarkable—and it helps to prove my point around the tactical maneuvering on the part of the Leader of the Opposition and his transportation critic, the member from Kitchener–Conestoga, when they realized that they were in a position for which, really and truly, in the public’s eye, there would be no defence. At the end of the day, how can you be opposed to more safety for school children and for the elderly? I congratulate members of the NDP caucus, and in particular, the transportation critic from the NDP, the member from Niagara Falls, for taking a far more enlightened perspective with respect to this legislation and realizing what it was really all about.", "I don’t want to relitigate this entire matter. It’s already been through committee. But I am proud of this legislation, and I just want to stress that it’s unfortunate that throughout debate, members of the Conservative caucus really focused their remarks on one particular aspect, almost dogmatically on this aspect, that they were so opposed to photo radar and that this manoeuvre was merely a cash grab.", "When it got to committee, they suddenly found religion, as the saying goes, and tried to position themselves on the side of the angels. I don’t think anyone in the province of Ontario was fooled. I certainly wasn’t. The good news is, should we pass this legislation, I’ve committed that my ministry will work really closely with all of our partners and municipalities as we consult over the next number of months. Frankly, I invited the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex to work with us on that consultation, and I’m happy to do that, to make sure we do land in the right place and that we link the infraction in the Highway Traffic Act to the technology that exists as it relates to school buses. I look forward to working with the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex and all of our other partners to make sure that we get there.", "I just wanted to make sure it was clear and on the record that it’s been disappointing for me to witness the spectacle that Patrick Brown, the Leader of the Opposition, and his henchmen have put forward at committee on this particular bill.", "I want to spend my remaining time, if I might—I’ve said this at various points in debate, not just here but elsewhere. I talked about this as it relates to road safety. Again, I want to stress, we are not compelling any municipality to do a particular thing, but it is important for me to recognize that we have heard from mayors, we have heard from regional chairs, we have heard from councillors, and we have certainly heard from all of our partners in the road safety realm about the importance of making sure that we move forward with these measures.", "With my remaining couple of minutes, I do want to say, in particular to my colleague who is going to speak just after me, the member from Ottawa Centre, the Attorney General and our government House leader, he is someone, not long after I became the Minister of Transportation back in 2014, who spoke to me about the importance of making sure that we worked with our communities to empower them, to strengthen some of the rules and regulations around this. I know this member in particular, obviously representing downtown Ottawa, where, not unlike communities like Leaside here in the city of Toronto and elsewhere around the province, there are particular and well-founded concerns on the part of parents who unfortunately witness too many motorists flying through the streets of their communities, of their neighbourhoods, near schools and in community safety zones—the Attorney General, the member from Ottawa Centre, I know feels passionately about the mandate that he received locally from the people of Ottawa Centre on these issues. He was a strong and staunch and persistent advocate—and I say that in a complimentary way—a persistent advocate with respect to these measures. I know he’ll be speaking in just a moment, but I wanted to thank him publicly here on the record for his advocacy and for being such a strong champion of these kinds of initiatives.", "The last thing I will say about this is that a number of weeks ago, Premier Wynne, myself, the mayor of Toronto and law enforcement partners all convened in Leaside at an elementary school, in a particular neighbourhood of Leaside that witnessed and experienced and had to, very unfortunately, absorb its own serious tragedy around this issue. There was a very young girl who, not that many years ago, was unfortunately killed in her neighbourhood because of someone who didn’t stop appropriately at a stop sign.", "I’m not going to suggest that this legislation will fix 100% of these situations, 100% in every single circumstance. But to listen to the parents who were there that day—teachers, parents, law enforcement and others from the road safety community—talk very poignantly about what they experienced in that neighbourhood, I think on this one I can speak for the Premier, and I’ll certainly speak for myself: It was encouraging to hear their story. It was heartbreaking, but it was encouraging because there was clear recognition in that room the day we announced these initiatives and that we would be going forward with introducing Bill 65—it was clear that we were moving in the right direction, that we were adding one more set of tools to the tool kit, as the saying goes, to help our municipal partners, but most importantly, to help those individuals who rely on the Ministry of Transportation, rely on the Attorney General, rely on our Premier and on our government to make sure that when it comes to guaranteeing that we’re going to find creative ways to improve road safety, we actually step up to the plate, because we have an obligation to do so.", "I sincerely hope throughout the rest of debate this afternoon that we will hear from members of the Conservative caucus that they’ve seen the light, that they will support Bill 65, like we are and like I believe the members of the NDP caucus are as well.", "With that, I thank you very much for having the opportunity to address you on Bill 65 this afternoon." ],

It’s that perspective, the perspective that I have learned and appreciated from my community, that I want to present today.", "Before I do that, I want to compliment the Minister of Transportation, the member from Vaughan, for bringing this very important initiative. He is right: As soon as he was sworn in as the Minister of Transportation, I had the opportunity to sit down with him and talk about some of the concerns around my community, around people speeding in neighbourhood streets in the downtown community that I represent, to talk about our school zones, and to speak to instances that I’ve heard from moms and dads in my community directly. He was attentive; he was thoughtful. Right away, our conversation went to possible solutions that are available. It was a few conversations like that that we had together, aided by his staff, where we started talking about different options and solutions that are available to ensure that our communities, particularly our municipalities, have the tools available to them, have the suite of options available to them to make our streets safe.", "I think we both agreed right from the get-go that for any type of measure to be successful, we have to empower local communities. We have to really give the tools to our municipalities, as opposed to bringing a sort of heavy hand from the province, because each community is different. Each municipality is different. This is a diverse province and it’s important that we respect that diversity and ensure that we give municipalities the powers equally so that they can then decide what works best for them.", "I think what you see here, Speaker, is a tremendous amount of work that has been done by the Minister of Transportation, the member for Vaughan, and his ministry, with some really practical solutions—the result of significant consultations, even before the bill was presented, with municipalities and the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, AMO.", "As I said here earlier, my aim is to bring the perspective of my community that I have the great privilege of representing. As I have said before in this House, one of the great joys I have as the MPP for Ottawa Centre is to knock on doors every weekend on Saturdays in my community. That allows me to have regular conversations with my constituents on matters that are important to them. One of the issues that I continue to hear, and one of the issues that I used to hear a lot about, is the concern around people speeding in residential neighbourhoods. We’re not talking about main thoroughfares; we’re talking about residential streets.", "I have the great privilege of representing downtown Ottawa, with some incredible neighbourhoods. They’re densely populated. We’re seeing a fair bit of intensification taking place. More and more, people are choosing to live in vibrant neighbourhoods like the Glebe or Westboro or Carleton Heights or Old Ottawa South, which are located in my riding, just to name a few. What we’re finding is that as young families are moving in and enjoying the downtown living, you also attract a lot of traffic, especially people going to work, and we see people speeding. The question becomes: What can you do to slow people down?", "We have seen parents and community associations taking up activities like “drive slow” campaigns that we see a lot across the province, where they’ve made their own signs. In our case in Ottawa, the city of Ottawa, through the public health office, became part of that as well to, again, remind drivers in residential streets around school zones that there are lives at risk. We’ve got young children whom we encourage to walk to school or use their bikes, and it is up to us to protect them. We have seniors who are more active now and are out there in the communities. We need to protect them.", "It was in the last election in 2014 that I made a commitment to my community that, if I were privileged enough to be re-elected on their behalf, reducing speed limits in residential streets from 50 kilometres an hour to something less—like 40 or 30—was something I was going to advocate on their behalf. That was one of the important mandates that was given to me by my community.", "I’m really proud that here we are on third reading of Bill 65 with measures like giving municipalities the power to be able to reduce speed limits on residential streets from 50 kilometres an hour to 40 or 30 as part of this. The fact that we’ve got photo radar as a tool for school zones and community safety zones is part of this initiative. And we are making it easy for municipalities to use red-light cameras, also, to make intersections safe.", "All of these three measures, Speaker, I can tell you, are very much supported by my community. Since the bill was tabled, I have been constantly communicating with my constituents, letting them know every step of the way the process that is undertaken. I can tell you, I continue to get more and more encouragement and more and more support for Bill 65. In fact, the questions I often get are how quickly this bill can pass and how quickly the community associations and our residents can start working with the city of Ottawa so that they can have their neighbourhoods declared neighbourhoods with lower speed limits.", "I’m also quite encouraged to note that the city of Ottawa, with the support of our mayor, Jim Watson, is also very supportive of Bill 65. In fact, I had a great opportunity to work with the city of Ottawa in bringing forward a motion at city council asking the province to take exactly these measures, both in terms of the power to reduce speed limits on residential streets and also to be able to have photo radar in school zones and community safety zones. So we actually have a motion passed by the city of Ottawa council that was sent to the government, both to the Premier and the Minister of Transportation—I believe I was copied on that correspondence—asking to do the same.", "They have remained steadfast in their support for Bill 65. In fact, members who were on the committee would recall that we had six city councillors from Ottawa who presented, some of them in person right here at Queen’s Park and the others through teleconference. All six of them expressed their strong support for this bill and were able to, quite eloquently, of course, answer the questions that were put forward by members of the committee.", "I want to thank councillors Riley Brockington, Keith Egli, Jeff Leiper, Catherine McKenney, Tobi Nussbaum and Mathieu Fleury for the work they do at home in our community in Ottawa and for taking the time to either come down to Queen’s Park or present by telephone on this very important measure. They were all kind enough to give me some credit, but it’s a partnership under which we work together to represent our residents.", "I have highlighted that just so that members know that a municipality like Ottawa, which is the second-largest municipality in the province, is very much supportive of this bill. In fact, in anticipation of this legislation being passed by this House, the city of Ottawa has already started working on their policy guidelines on how to declare certain residential streets around 30 kilometres an hour. They’ve actually started doing their side of the work in hopes that this bill will pass into law so that they can immediately, once it comes into force, start doing the work necessary to make our neighbourhood streets even safer. I just wanted to raise that point.", "I also want to, again, make sure to thank members of my community: members from community associations; individual parents who came to see me; people who I met at the door, people like Donna Chiarelli and Catherine James-McGuinty; members of community associations, like Wellington Village Community Association, the Glebe Community Association, and the Carlington Community Association, again just to name a few; and on and on and on. They all very much wholeheartedly support this legislation and again have been inquiring as to when this bill will pass into law.", "One of the other things I can tell you that my residents are very clear about, Speaker, is that none of these measures amount to a cash grab. Their point is very clear, and I wholeheartedly agree, that following the law is what we are supposed to do. That’s why we created the laws. If you break the law, there have to be consequences attached to it. If you are breaking the speed limit in a school zone and then you get caught by a photo radar, by no stretch of the imagination or definition is that a cash grab. Guess what? You broke the law. The best way not to pay that fine is not to break the law.", "Speaker, I just wanted to make that point very, very clear, that this is not a cash grab. These are tools in the tool kit for municipalities to make sure that they continue to keep their school zones, their community zones and their residential streets safe. If somebody is going to break the law, then they’re going to have to face the consequences. In this instance, breaking the law could mean losing the life of a child or an elderly person in our community. That’s something, as members of this Legislature, that should be absolutely unacceptable to us.", "In conclusion, I just want to say that I am very excited that we are at a point where this bill is up for third reading. I want to thank the minister. I want to thank other members in this House who have been supporting this bill. This is a step in the right direction in making sure that we are making our neighbourhoods safe.", "I can tell you that my community of Ottawa Centre thanks this Legislature and the government for bringing in this important measure. This is going to make a marked difference in my community around our schools and our neighbourhood streets. I just cannot wait, Speaker, to share the good news.", "I hope that the third reading won’t take too long so we can pass this bill and get on with the steps to implement this bill through MTO, because we cannot come to the day soon enough where we make our schools and our residential streets safe. Thank you very much, Speaker, for the time." ],

School boards and municipalities want some way—they want the power—to be able to find the people who are running stop signs or speeding through school zones, not obeying traffic signs, not obeying speed limits. They want the ability to track these people, to somehow hold them to account for their decision.", "Imagine if a child got injured or killed.

She is also the parliamentary assistant, as she mentioned, at the Ministry of Transportation, and she did a phenomenal job, as she always has, working very closely with me and my team on this particular legislation. So I do want to thank her publicly here in this chamber for the work she did.", "I also want to mention the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex. He and I have had conversations about his concern regarding using technology, using cameras around school buses. I want to thank him because I do believe, in my heart of hearts, that his heart is in the right place. As I mentioned in debate this afternoon, I look forward to having the opportunity to work with him as we go forward, should this legislation pass, with greater consultation to make sure we get that particular piece right.", "I want to thank the member from Windsor and the NDP caucus for their support for this legislation and for being the voice of reason when it comes to the opposition on this particular bill.", "But I think what we saw here this afternoon, when the member from Thornhill spoke, in particular, is exactly what the challenge is with the Conservative caucus on this legislation. On the one hand, throughout debate at second reading, we were told, as the Attorney General mentioned, that this is a cash grab, that it’s about reintroducing photo radar on highways. We brought forward an amendment to scope the speed limit for the community safety zones in which the technology can be used so that it cannot be deployed on a municipally owned freeway, expressway or highway.", "Then today, a second ago, the member from Thornhill said that if you’re going to use photo radar, it’s not appropriate because you’re only going to catch the person who owns the car, not the driver of the vehicle. And she immediately follows it up by saying, “But you should put cameras on school buses so that if somebody blows by, the owner of the car that blows by gets a ticket.”", "There’s a fundamental misunderstanding on the part of that member and the Conservative caucus around this legislation. I hope they get their act straight and support Bill 65, because it is the right thing to do." ],

  "text" : [ "Bill 65 is back up for third reading today. I think it’s important to get it right out from the get-go that the Ontario PC caucus, led by our leader, Patrick Brown, the member for Simcoe North, absolutely, 100% supports initiatives that keep our kids safe. We’re all parents here. I hope to be joined, perhaps later in the hour, by my own family. Of course, I’ve got a five-year-old, Murphy, a three-year-old, Lincoln, and Rosy’s just about to turn two. Murphy, obviously, just started going to school this year. At each and every opportunity we talk about safety on our roads, we instantly think of our loved ones: family, friends, but of course our immediate families. I’m proud of the fact that since 2011 as MPP for Kitchener–Conestoga, this caucus and our leader have supported many, many road safety initiatives that in fact had been, fortunately, adopted by the government, but more importantly, the government of the past led with many safety initiatives. I hope to get into some of those this afternoon as we talk about Bill 65, but I really think it’s important.", "Nobody believes—nobody believes for a minute—when either the government or the third party suggest that the Ontario PC caucus doesn’t support keeping our kids safe. They know that’s nonsense. That’s the problem, perhaps, with this place: Partisan politics always gets injected into divisive debates on good or bad measures. I think it’s all-important and -encompassing to know—and perhaps I’ll get into the role of Her Majesty’s loyal opposition later, but I just want to make that abundantly clear.", "Again, like I said, nobody believes the nonsense that you hear about Patrick Brown and the Ontario PCs not being supportive of safety initiatives on our roads. Nonsense. So I just want to reiterate how we will continue to be absolutely supportive of keeping our kids, our families and our loved ones safe on Ontario highways.", "The point of this bill, Bill 65, the Safer School Zones Act—we were asking that if you were going to name a bill and bring a bill forward—and I know that it was light on substance to begin with; I know it was only eight or so pages. This was really the first opportunity that the Minister of Transportation has had as minister. Bill 31 was, of course, introduced by his colleague from Toronto Centre, so he adopted that bill—but a bill of his own, to really have a staple piece of legislation to call his own, and this was his first attempt at it. I just don’t know that I would want this to be my legacy if I was in his role, but it will be his, to have a piece of legislation that—great bill title—lacked a lot of the substance that I think we actually need to truly keep our kids safe, our schools safe.", "I have to ask our listeners to pay close attention, because this trail that the government has led us and the people of Ontario down as they’ve pushed this legislation forward is a path full of diversions—it really is—and mixed messages, all in the effort to convince the public that Bill 65 is really all about school safety. I’ll get into this in much more depth as I move forward, but to begin, if it were all about student safety, the government members would have adopted our amendment to improve the bill through doubling fines in school zones.", "I’ll give you an example. After this bill becomes law, you’re going to have photo radar in school zones and community safety zones. School zones are defined; community safety zones are not. But if you are subject to a fine in either of those, if you were given it in a community safety zone, the fine would actually be doubled. You would be fined double. If that same vehicle, moments later, was passing through at the same speed in a school zone, the fine would actually be half. If it’s all about school safety, then why is the fine less in a school zone than it is in a community safety zone?", "We said, during clause-by-clause—which really is the only opportunity that an opposition party has. There are no consultations done with the opposition prior to a bill being introduced. We talk about it at second reading debate. We had a minimal amount of time to do that. Clause-by-clause is that opportunity. We said, “Look, let’s make the fines equal in a school zone to what they are in a community safety zone.”", "Can anybody guess how they voted on that amendment? No guesses, but I’ll tell you quickly: They said no to it. They said no.", "Again, if it’s about student safety, we asked, “Would you adopt our amendment to improve the bill through the use of radar speed signs?”" ],

We proposed that to the committee: “Let’s roll these speed signs out across the province and provide resources to municipalities.” What did the Liberal members say in committee? They said no. They said no. They said no.", "So we proposed another amendment that would have adopted our call to improve the bill through taking aim at school bus blow-bys. I’m going to have a much greater opportunity near the end of the debate, or mid-debate, to talk about that specific safety initiative. It’s an important safety measure that’s been on the order paper here for perhaps a year, maybe even longer: debated twice, approved unanimously by all three political parties in the Legislature; brought forward by my colleague from Chatham–Kent–Essex. I think it’s perhaps one of the most important safety initiatives currently before Parliament here in Ontario, brought forward by my colleague, to truly keep kids safe. What did they do? They said no.", "I will say I was happy to have the support of my colleague from the third party. We didn’t have a lot of chance to chat throughout the committee. I know that was a compliment given to him by the government. We would obviously have loved to have had more rigorous debate and discussion from all three political parties, but I will say I appreciate the acknowledgement that this was an important initiative, and the third party adopted and supported our call for that. We want to thank them for that. They voted yes, but the government said no.", "Again, if it were about student safety, they would have adopted our amendments to improve the bill through defining community safety zones. We’re a bit in the weeds here, but school safety zones are clearly defined in the Highway Traffic Act. Everybody knows exactly what they are: a specific radius around a school; that area is defined as a school zone. “Community safety zones”—ambiguous. Basically, by bylaw a municipality can designate any area a community safety zone. We felt there was a necessity to be clear and consistent right across the province. Like school zones in the Highway Traffic Act, let’s clearly define what a community safety zone is. Do you want to know how they voted on that, Speaker? They said no. They said no to that important initiative.", "The Attorney General, the member for Ottawa—we heard many of the local officials from Ottawa come down and speak to committee. I was there and heard them reiterate the fact that they would be supportive of revenues that were generated through the use of photo radar to be used and directed specifically for road safety measures. We thought, “Do you know what? That’s a good idea. Let’s allocate and redirect any of the revenues generated from photo radar directly back into road safety initiatives and measures.” We proposed an amendment—because that’s the opportunity we get at clause-by-clause—to suggest, “Let’s direct the revenues from photo radar directly to safety initiatives on our roads.” That’s one of only 40 amendments that we actually debated—one of only 40.", "I know they have a difficult time with math over there. They talk about “200 and some”; I read an article now, 219, and I heard 300—a difficult time with math over there. But if you look at it, just around 40 amendments were actually debated in committee.", "Reinvesting revenues back into road safety: We proposed it, debated it, and guess what they said? They said no. They said, “No. We don’t like that one.”", "You know, we continue to hear this campaign of blow-by smears against official opposition members in an effort to distract from the reality that they find hard to admit. That truth is just this: that Bill 65 could have been all about school safety. We had told them time and again, “If you keep it about school zones, we’re with you 100%—100%, we’re with you,” but they didn’t. It could have been about all of us working together for the benefit of our children, but instead the Liberals chose to turn this opportunity to enhance school safety into a political wedge to force photo radar back onto roadways across Ontario. The more we saw them protest and try to divert that unwanted attention, the more we saw them stand in the way of clear safety enhancements and the more it became clear that, while Bill 65 could have been all about student safety, it unfortunately wasn’t.", "I think one of our first clues to the Liberal approach of diversion and misleadership came just hours before our first committee meeting to go through clause-by-clause consideration of the bill. That morning, in response to a well-written piece by Antonella Artuso of the Toronto Sun with the front page headline “Under the Radar,” the Premier took to the airwaves to suggest the bill would not indeed allow photo radar on municipal roads, despite the fact that it most obviously did: “That’s not going to happen and you and I know it,” Premier Wynne said. “It’s about keeping kids safe.” That was followed by a report in the Sun indicating that “Premier Kathleen Wynne guarantees a new bill before the Legislature on photo radar will not be used anywhere but in school zones.” That’s what she said.", "Then, it was the transportation minister’s turn indicating, “I think that the Conservative Party putting forward the notion that somehow municipalities would embark on a very bizarre approach to expanding community safety zones, that they can use photo radar sort of at will is conflating the issue.” That’s what he said. Yes, it would have been conflating the issue if the bill did not allow the expansion of photo radar, through community safety zone designations, as the Premier and minister wanted us to believe.", "But the facts were laid bare that afternoon when ministry legal counsel David Milner reported that, indeed, the bill could be used to expand photo radar onto roads outside of school zones right across the province. As Mr. Milner states in Hansard, “If the road is a municipal road, and the area with that road in it has been designated as a community safety zone, then it would be open to the use of the speed enforcement cameras”—a.k.a. photo radar.", "Now, we felt that the bill really truly should be called what it actually does, and suggested that we rename the bill “the Ontario photo radar act, 2016.” I thought that was a fair suggestion. They obviously said no to that one as well.", "But, you know, Speaker, it doesn’t get much clearer than that. As much as the Liberal members attempted to change the channel and try to get us to believe otherwise, the fact is that Bill 65, at first and second reading, allowed for photo radar on municipal expressways. The bill, at second reading, allowed for photo radar on major expressways, parkways and highways right across the province." ],

Again, all through committee, I had encouraged the members to take some time in the evening, and read up on the Westminster system that we have here, part of our democracy, our parliamentary system, to truly understand what it’s all about. We had—and have—an opportunity during second reading debate to, obviously, present our case on some issues or problems that we have with the bill. We had to show our intention to say, “Look, the bill, as is, isn’t where we think it should be.” We objected to that, and we sent a message to the government to say, “In committee, we need to fix this bill to get it right. We’re going to say no to you at that opportunity, so that you heed our call and listen to our opposition.” That’s an important part of democracy.", "I really think this is a pressing opportunity now—I know we’ve got 40-something minutes left. Back in 1949, Mr. Diefenbaker spoke about the role of our parliamentary system. He said:", "“If Parliament is to be preserved as a living institution His”—obviously “his” at the time—“Majesty’s loyal opposition”—now “hers,” of course—“must fearlessly perform its functions. When it properly discharges them the preservation of our freedom is assured. The reading of history proves that freedom always dies when criticism ends. It upholds and maintains the rights of minorities against majorities. It must be vigilant against oppression and unjust invasions by the cabinet of the rights of the people. It should supervise all expenditures and prevent over expenditure by exposing to the light of public opinion wasteful expenditures or worse. It finds fault; it suggests amendments; it asks questions and elicits information; it arouses, educates and molds public opinion by voice and vote. It must scrutinize every action by the government and in doing so prevents the short-cuts through democratic procedure that governments like to make.", "“Parliament is a place where in full discussion freedom is preserved, where one side advances arguments and the other examines them and where decisions are arrived at after passing through the crucible of public discussion.", "“The opposition that discharges its responsibilities becomes the responsible outlet of intelligent criticism. Indeed, most, if not all, authorities on constitutional government agree that Britain’s freedom from civil war since the development of the party system is due in the main to the fact that the opposition has provided an outlet and a safety valve for opposition.”", "I want to go back to why this is important. I mentioned during committee on Bill 65, the Safer School Zones Act, that this is part of the process, that by saying “no” during second reading, we sent a message to the government that there were problems with the bill. Had we all just kind of held hands and sung Kumbaya—what’s the fun in that? That doesn’t advance the cause of Ontarians.", "We are sent here, obviously, by our communities. I always suggest that if my community wanted a member of the government, they would have elected one. But they didn’t: They elected me, and I thank them for that. My job is now to perform the duties of the official opposition, and I will live each and every day for those duties to the fullest extent I possibly can.", "Now, I want to go back. Diefenbaker said, “The government tends to regard the opposition as the brake on a car going uphill whereas the opposition thinks the car is going downhill.”", "Of course, he says, “It is human nature for governments to find the opposition distasteful and the longer governments are in power the more they become convinced that they govern by divine right and that their decisions are infallible.” That sounds an awful lot like where we’re at today, Speaker. “Only a strong opposition can prevent a cabinet with a commanding majority from ruling without regard to the rights of minorities. Independence is not looked for among most private members supporting the government, for individual independence more often than not denies personal preferment. As for collective independence by the members supporting the government, the cabinet is master by holding over its majority the threat of dissolution.”", "Look, I just think it is important. He said also, “Countries cannot be fully free until they have an organized opposition. It is not a long step from the absence of an organized opposition to a complete dictatorship.”", "You know what? I think you guys get the picture of where I’m going with this. This is the job that we have. This is what this side represents.

One of the committee members even held a news conference where he spouted the spin that moved even further from the truth as the committee deliberations progressed and Liberal members became more desperate to label us. He said that much of the spin surrounded the fact that the PCs were filibustering the bill by introducing over 300 amendments, and the amendments would remove roads that had schools on them from potential photo radar usage. Of course, Speaker, none of that is true at all.", "While the Liberals wanted to go on about our introduction of 300 amendments to slow down committee, the truth is that we saw just over 40 PC amendments that were actually introduced and debated—only 40. While the Liberals wanted to go on about our draft amendments taking away photo radar from school zone roads, the truth is that while amendments were drafted to remove specific roads from photo radar—that were not introduced—they specifically excluded areas with school zones from the restriction. Therefore, at no time did amendments attempt to remove Bill 65’s photo radar provisions from school zones.", "And while the Liberals wanted to go on and on about our filibustering, the truth is that clause-by-clause at committee ran for a total of about just over six hours. That’s not an extraordinary length of time for a bill, by any comparison, and clearly not delayed by filibusters as the government accuses. They had an entire news conference based on these mistruths. Of course—fake spin, fake news—they even had parents on the podium who were misled to believe that they were targeting roads with schools on them for removal of photo radar. That’s completely false, just false.", "While the media was wary enough to see through the ruse, they continued to spout their prepared lines to smear the opposition, which was simply just trying to do its job. Just because the Liberal members—whether it be the minister, the member for Eglinton–Lawrence who directed the press conference or, of course, my neighbouring committee member from Kitchener Centre—repeat a mistruth enough times, it doesn’t make it true.", "The funny thing is, while that press conference I referenced was designed to target the opposition, the members present spent the media Q&A answering questions with regard to their support—or actual lack thereof—for our amendments to address school bus blow-bys. I want to talk about that, Speaker, because I think that that is an extremely important opportunity here. The media understood that if, indeed, Bill 65 was focused on student safety, as the government has led us to believe, surely it would make sense to support a key amendment, based on the twice-introduced private member’s bill of our colleague from Chatham–Kent–Essex, which would protect children getting on and off school buses.", "The Chair of the committee thought it made sense enough to rule our amendment in order for committee consideration. I think that is an important note to make. A variety of amendments were put forward. Of course, being from Kitchener-Waterloo, roundabouts are a prevalent item; there are 40-plus roundabouts in our community. One of the first things when elected as an MPP, one of the first emails or pieces of correspondence I got, was from a parent whose child was hit at a roundabout near a school.

This isn’t a priority. He should be thinking about the bigger issues.” Well, Speaker, come to the region of Waterloo, and if you’re not talking about roundabouts after you leave, then you were probably walking.", "I know the member from Kitchener–Waterloo agrees with what I’m saying here. Roundabouts are extremely important. They’re an important safety tool, but we need to create some consistent rules on the safety and the use of roundabouts. This was on my mind. I said, “Let’s talk about roundabouts and embed them in the Highway Traffic Act with regard to the Safe Schools Act,” because a St. Mary’s High School student was severely injured when crossing at a roundabout. There are still inconsistencies about how pedestrians and motorists work together in a roundabout.", "Unfortunately, that particular amendment was ruled out of order. I asked for it to be brought in and to be considered, which would have simply been done by a unanimous consent motion. Of course, they said no to that. I was fine; we will move on.

I believe that it’s worthy of being discussed here.” That was the Chair of the general government committee.

This endangers kids getting on and off the bus, especially if they are crossing the street.", "“During a 23-day test last year, a private firm that put its traffic cameras on six Waterloo region school buses says it recorded 97 drivers who failed to stop over 23 days.” Guys, in a 23-day pilot project, 97 drivers blew by school buses—97.", "“‘The footage is really scary,’ said Benoit Bourgault, general manager of Student Transportation Services of Waterloo Region, which coordinates school buses. ‘We have an example of a student who was almost hit by a car.’” Almost hit by a car.", "“Usually, the driver gets away with the reckless behaviour. That’s because the $490 ticket can only be issued if the bus driver happens to take down the licence plate number. And bus drivers have many other things to do as they drive the route.” Their focus should be on their passengers, ensuring their safety while on the bus and, of course, while getting off. It’s not to have a pen and paper writing down the model and make of a vehicle that happens to blow by the bus.", "“A camera should be able to store an image of the licence plate and the ticket should be sent in the mail without any human witnesses, just as red-light cameras do.”", "We said: Look, when a bus is stopped with its red flashing lights on or its safety arm activated, if a vehicle passes a bus or from the rear, if it comes closer than 20 metres, automatic offence. Automatic offence, $490, admissible in the courts as a stand-alone piece of evidence. Right now, of course, the government will say, “Oh, look, cameras are already used in the courts.” Yes, they are, but you have to have a witness, oftentimes the police officer or bus driver—it doesn’t really hold up. This is the opportunity.", "But, of course, it’s not the law yet. “If it’s okay to have photo evidence to convict drivers of running red lights, then it should also be okay to use it to protect our most vulnerable users on the road.” Of course, I couldn’t agree more.", "I want to remind folks of the red-light cameras, another important safety measure on our roads that in fact a Progressive Conservative government adopted, initiated and passed through by law in 1998, with the support of all three political parties.

In Mississauga, it’s two and a half, almost three. And yet, we had Liberal committee members, including the member for Kitchener Centre, denying us this opportunity to actually address it directly.", "In fact, the government, through their deputations, invited the company that does these pilot projects for these school bus blow-bys. They actually invited them to be a delegation on this bill. So you’ve got, at one opportunity, the government inviting a company to talk about school bus blow-bys. They heard the deputation from that company. Then they vigorously debated their own Chair to suggest that my amendment to address this issue should be ruled out of order.

We felt that this was an important initiative to move forward right now.", "I asked the government, “How come you don’t see this as a priority right now? Tell me one good reason why this isn’t a priority for you.” They couldn’t; they didn’t. They’re like, “We’re just not sure about the technology and the cameras,” blah, blah, blah. That’s just a bunch of excuses because it was an idea from an opposition member on this side of the House. The end result? Partisan politics played by the government to not adopt an important safety initiative brought forward by the Ontario PC Party, led by Patrick Brown. That’s what that was about.", "We heard the reasons that were given: The Highway Traffic Act requires for cameras to show flashing lights. But that’s something that we could have also dealt with through amendments. During committee, there’s lots of debate and discussion. We hear now about technicalities. We believed the amendment we proposed and asked for unanimous consent on recently would in fact have been the fix the government would adopt. We’re talking about photo radar; let’s talk about school-bus-camera blow-bys. They said all this nonsense about the technology, but they never, ever, at any time, offered to amend our amendment—never once. Not, “Well, we think you should do this or that.” They’ve got the resources as the government—not once; they never said a word. “We want to amend your amendment to do this or that”—they didn’t even want to hear it. They didn’t want to hear us.", "I did an interview with Luisa D’Amato. I talked about the fact that the government feels that we’re a nuisance. I say that I’m doing my job as an opposition member, putting forward additional ideas. Again, the only opportunity we have as an opposition member is during second reading debate and then at committee, during clause-by-clause. That is the opportunity we have. I know the members over there are not used to how the opposition works on this side, but that’s how our parliamentary process works. Again, I hope some of them—just a few of them—get that opportunity to actually understand that.", "Of course, that said, we do recognize that the minister has written a letter to the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex spelling out a direction towards consultations on his bill in the summer.

That is a reality: It won’t be there. It’s because this government stood in the way of that. They stood in the way of that.", "I talked about the doubling of penalties in community safety zones. We talked about strong deterrence for school zone speeders, and yet, once again, the government said no. That was, of course, to the doubling of the fines.", "On the subject of getting improved road safety and better drivers around our kids, if this bill were truly about making our streets safer and protecting our children, then why did the Liberals not agree to the revenues—and I talked about the revenues from the operation of photo radar systems—going back into other traffic light amendments? Of course, we respect our municipal partners, but all governments need checks and balances to prevent the good intentions of decision-makers from being diverted. Mandating that photo radar fines only be used for traffic safety measures is reasonable and respects the intent of the bill.", "Of course, the government will talk about respect for municipalities. I would have actually liked the minister, had he had more time—and he did—to actually give his speech that he was going to give one day on tolls. He was pro-toll at the time, until his Premier told him—or really, until the vigorous cabinet discussion that they were going to lose their seats if they didn’t yank the tolls off the table. The Premier said to the municipalities, “We’re with you 100%. Just go out and ask for them and we’ll give them to you. We respect your ability and your autonomy to make those decisions.” She pulled the carpet from underneath them and said, “No, we’re not going to give you tolls. Because you know what? We need to save our own political bacon. So no to tolls.” Obviously, I’m confused with—we’ll talk about municipalities, on one hand, and they take it on the other.", "Radar speed signs: I talked about them and the fact that the city of Toronto has a pilot project for these. The purpose of the speed display signs is to display the speed of the vehicle when it enters a school zone. It was initially a pilot program that proved so successful that last June, the city of Toronto council voted to make it a city-wide program that any and every school in the city is eligible to apply for. Due to the high demand for these radar speed signs, the city of Toronto implemented a criterion for eligibility that prioritizes locations with a history of high collision rates, pedestrian injuries and excessive traffic speeds, which are reviewed by qualified traffic engineers, not politicians.", "I commend the local politicians who advocated for the city-wide rollout of this program and their collaboration with the local police, who were able to conduct random enforcement at some of these sites. We want to ensure that we don’t see less actual police enforcement in our subdivisions, in our community zones or in our school zones because of this bill. That has the potential to happen: “Oh, don’t worry. We’ve got a box on a pole somewhere to slow traffic down. It will catch all the bad guys. It will catch all the impaired drivers. It will catch the distracted drivers on their phones. Don’t worry, we’ve got a box to take a photo of your licence plate.” That’s the fear we have. That’s a reality.", "There’s nothing better that I like to see on a weekend or on a busy morning than a Waterloo region police car outside my subdivision. It’s one of the best things I like to see every morning. It’s not every morning, of course, but I’ll tell you it’s something I like to see, knowing that the men and women in blue are out there enforcing on all traffic violations. Distracted driving, impaired driving, aggressive driving: All these things are important to combat.", "Back to the signs: I was extremely disappointed that my attempt to raise awareness about speed radars prior to the launch was rejected. Similarly, I proposed an amendment to require educational mailings for first-time speeding offenders in photo radar zones instead of a fine. It was also rejected.", "This clearly points to a pattern. You’ve already heard me pointing out what is the true purpose of Bill 65. We brought forward amendments. In fact, we brought forward an amendment that was identical to theirs, and guess what they did? They said no to ours. Before the small change that they made, this bill would have allowed for photo radar on major expressways and roads. It still is on major roads. We’ve got a councillor out of Hamilton asking for photo radar to be on the Linc and the Red Hill, 90 km/h. Identify them as community safety zones and you’ve got photo radar. That’s what they wanted.", "It was our opposition during second reading debate that told the government they’ve got to pare that back. That was an objection of ours. You know what? They actually did listen to us. They proposed one amendment that said that photo radar cannot be on highways over 90 km/h. We believe it should be 50 and over. We got a small, little win there. That was through our objection to this bill on second reading that we feel we got that. Had we all held hands and sung Kumbaya, I can guarantee you, that change would never have happened. It would never have happened. But it did, so we’re happy about that.", "Now, of course a municipal bylaw could pare the speed limit down to 80, and then it would apply, but we don’t feel that’s the case. You never know. But we said, “No, you’ve got to fix this. It’s one small amendment.”", "We talked about requiring signage indicating the use of a photo radar system every 100 metres within a school zone, 200 or 500 metres—we believe that signage should be out there for people. It shouldn’t be a sneaky way to generate cash. It should be well-signed. We believe that’s another important amendment. Of course, the Liberals shot down that amendment. We talked about the proper signage. It really was unfortunate that the government didn’t want to clarify what the parameters for using photo radar were or ensure drivers have fair warning about photo radar.", "We talked about no photo radar systems in community safety zones where the speed limit is greater than 50. We feel that that was a major initiative we talked about. We encouraged people to lower their speed to reduce fatalities, improving safety on our roads. But allowing for a blanket, province-wide speed reduction measure will not necessarily result in safer streets. In fact, municipalities already have the ability to lower speed limits. They already have that ability. I proposed an amendment for a clearer definition of a community safety zone as well as a basic set of criteria that must be satisfied by municipalities to meet the warrants for a community safety zone designation, for this to be an effective traffic solution.", "After the second reading of the bill, the Liberals responded to the call for a more focused definition of community safety zones by disallowing designating roadways in excess of 80 kilometres as community safety zones. Of course I had mentioned that this was a positive change, but I am disappointed with the lack of consideration given to the consequences of enabling this broad community safety zone shortcut without mandating a minimum requirement for traffic warrants and reasonable evidence.", "It’s beyond my comprehension why the government rejected my amendment to mandate municipalities to conduct the public consultation, traffic studies and speeding reviews required to meet basic warrants for a community safety zone, to improve safety, and not to impose a false sense of safety.", "Municipal councillors do not classify roadways; traffic engineers do. They have the skills and training to make an assessment and provide the evidence to back their recommendations up. Appropriate categorization, classification and grouping of roadways enable safe and efficient use of the roadway for all users and modes of travel. Imposing a broadly defined community safety zone on a six-lane roadway designed to carry high volumes of traffic will not necessarily lead to better safety.", "Of course, the government rejected my amendment to have criteria that would filter and prioritize local roadways with higher pedestrian volumes, making virtually any roadway eligible for a community safety zone designation, regardless of what, if any, actual traffic-related problems might exist.", "I talked about the fact that we should have Canadian companies if we’re going to roll this technology out, to provide that investment, to have it manufactured here. We wanted to ensure that they were properly calibrated.", "I do want to get into again how they talked about this bill being about school safety. Speaker, I kind of ask—I know you don’t need to respond to me. I remain mystified as to why, instead of implementing strengthened fines in school zones, the bill focuses on things like returning bubbling licence plates.

Of course, vehicle owners face a $40 fee to replace defective licence plates, and $99 for personal plate replacements. Of course, if you’re out there driving about, you’re subject to a $110 fine for having a damaged plate or a plate that is not plainly visible.", "What do bubbling licence plates have to do with school safety?

We said, “Look, you’ve acknowledged the fact that you make crappy licence plates, and you should fix the problem permanently before you penalize motorists in Ontario with a $110 fine. Get this right.” We proposed an amendment: “Halt your little program until you know you’ve got a plate that works.” Because you know what? In Canada, it’s cold. It snows, it rains and the sun shines—we’re hoping that that comes sooner rather than later, but that’s what we get. Create a plate that actually holds the kind of weather here in the province, and until you do so, stop with this nonsense. We put an amendment forward to call for that; guess what they did? They said no. They said, “It’s about school safety, though. This bubbling plate stuff—it’s so important. It’s about school safety.”", "Why should motorists be threatened with plate cancellation replacement fees, when the problem is the government’s lack of oversight and due diligence in the first place?

Of course, we feel that’s important. “Photo radar” is clear; it’s well known.

School safety, the safety of our children and our grandchildren, is important. I believe it should be important to all of us. Our children are our most precious resource, and making sure that they are protected is something we should take very seriously. I’m very happy to be able to speak to this bill again today.", "As members in this Legislature, it’s pretty easy for us to get lost in the politics of this place.

This bill sets out to protect the public, and ultimately save the lives of our children.", "Something that we saw, and I’ll talk about later, has happened all too frequently in Toronto. I don’t know how anyone in this House can’t support that, quite frankly. I’d like to repeat that: I do not know how anyone in this House does not support that very basic fact. We heard from transportation groups like CAA; city councillors from all over the province, including as far away as Ottawa; traffic safety advocates; school representatives; and, of course, parents and school councils. Their message at the end of the day was clear. This bill will protect the public. It will protect our children.", "I’ll add something to that, because as we found out during the presentations around the schools, it would protect our teachers as well.", "Some may know, and some may not know, that my wife was a principal. She was a teacher. She retired about a year ago to take care of her dad. I talked to her on this bill because I figured she might know a little more about it than me. She said that every day they’re out there trying to educate the parents and the public on, “Please slow down. These are your kids.” She had near misses through the course of her career—near misses in her school. She never had anybody get hit by a car. She didn’t have anybody get killed, but she had lots of near misses.", "One of the first things they talked about when you meet in the school with the parents at the start of the year was this very issue, about driving carefully when you’re dropping off your kids. Don’t rush. Don’t speed. Come there, take your time, make sure the teacher’s safe, make sure the kids are safe, and then go on your way to whatever you’ve got to do. I appreciate that because that’s what she did for 30 years.", "Their message at the end of the day was clear: This bill will protect the public, and it will protect our kids. Overall, I understand and support the purpose of this bill: to make our school zones as safe as they possibly can be.", "As legislators, we cannot create or, in this case, support good policy if we don’t fully understand how this is going to affect the people this bill is meant to serve. It is the very basis of how good public policy is created.", "I have to say, before I move on, that the committee presentation stage for this bill was very impressive. I enjoyed being there. I enjoyed listening to the presenters. I also enjoyed being educated—something I do every day I come here. Almost all the presenters were very informative and were very insightful in their presentations.", "This goes back directly to my initial comment on how it can be easy to lose track of the real-life effects bills have on our communities. The presenters allowed us to really understand how this bill would go on to seriously address a problem for many schools in Ontario—and I don’t want to single out just Toronto, but we have had some terrible situations in Toronto and the GTA.", "Before I move on to discussing some of the presentations we received, which I feel gave great merit to this piece of legislation, I just want to publicly thank everyone again who took the time to come out to the committee and provide this insight and knowledge on this topic. It was extremely helpful.", "As many of you know, I served on city council before I came here. It was a council that functioned very well and one that I was proud to serve on, so I understand the reasoning behind this move to allow municipalities to make decisions around safety zones. I said this at committee. One of the main roads in Niagara Falls, which isn’t that far from where I live, is Kalar Road. There are four schools in that area, three public schools and a high school, and that municipality, the council I was on, talked about the importance of having a community safety zone, a school zone.", "What we did was, we lowered the speed limit, and we didn’t lower it for half an hour after school or half an hour before school; it was there all the time. Some people will say, “Why would you do that, because the kids are only there from 7 in the morning till 3 in the afternoon or 4 o’clock?” We wanted to make sure that the residents in Niagara Falls who drive that road all the time understand that kids are there after school. They’re playing soccer. Daycares are there. We voted to make sure that was a school safety zone, lowered the miles and—I’ll finish up tomorrow. Thank you very much, Speaker, for giving me a heads-up." ],

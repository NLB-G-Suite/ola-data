  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It’s a real privilege and an honour to be able to start off the debate today at the Ontario Legislature with the continuing discussion on Bill 7. The Minister of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure, of course, introduced that bill on July 7, and I’m continuing my leadoff debate on behalf of our Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, the official opposition, in my capacity as critic to the Minister of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure.", "As we’ve discussed and established, Bill 7 has two separate schedules, so it’s like a mini-omnibus bill. Schedule 1 is the Burden Reduction Reporting Act, and schedule 2 is the Partnerships for Jobs and Growth Act.", "Just to review, schedule 1, the Burden Reduction Reporting Act, requires the minister to publish an annual report on regulation or so-called burden reduction—burdens that the government, I guess, has created for small business. A burden is defined in the bill as a cost that is measured in “money, time or resources and is considered ... unnecessary to achieve the purpose ... that creates the cost.” In other words, the government is intending to report on how many unnecessary regulations they have eliminated. This also permits the minister to make regulations respecting the report, which may itself include regulation.", "Schedule 2 to the bill, the Partnerships for Jobs and Growth Act, permits the minister to prepare plans with respect to the development of geographical economic clusters. The minister has the authority to consult with those who have an interest in the plan, and amend, review and revoke the plan, if he chooses to do so. The minister can also make regulations about what goes into the plan, and he or she can decide who should be consulted and determines how the plan is reviewed, revoked and made public.", "Mr. Speaker, we’ve said on a number of occasions now, over the course of this debate, we submit and believe that the minister could do both of these things without Bill 7 if he chose to do so. Instead, he’s bringing in this bill, which would require him and future Ministers of Economic Development, I guess, to make this annual plan with respect to red tape reduction—although the bill calls it “burdens”—and to develop a cluster plan.", "As I say, this is something that the minister could do in both cases, actually, without the necessity of passing Bill 7. Nevertheless, this bill is before the House.", "I would again acknowledge that the Canadian Federation of Independent Business has indicated to me that they’re quite supportive of the bill because they support the first schedule because they believe they’ve encouraged the government to do this. Again, I would remind the House that the CFIB, for years, has been encouraging the government to reduce regulatory red tape that’s unnecessary. We know that small business people continue to express concerns about being encumbered—and in some cases being strangled—by red tape from the provincial government in particular, but other layers of government as well. The fact is every hour that a small business person has to spend dealing with government forms or dealing with what seem to be unnecessary regulations is an hour taken away from what they do best, which is actually servicing their customers and trying to expand their customer base so that the business can grow, so that the business can be profitable and so that the business can hire more people. That is the goal of most small business people, and it’s a goal that we understand on this side of the House and that we share. We want to support them every way we can.", "I want to again point out the CFIB’s additional concerns with respect to red tape. As far as I’m concerned, this Bill 7 does not go anywhere near accomplishing all the requests of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business in terms of red tape reduction. They’ve asked for the introduction of regulation on regulatory accountability. Again, the government I’m sure would argue that Bill 7 is a response to that, but CFIB is looking for much more. They’re asking for legislation to prescribe regulatory reduction targets to ensure that there is zero net growth in terms of regulations and red tape, helping to reinforce the 1-to-2 rule, whereby for every new regulation affecting small business and tying them up, two regulations would be eliminated.", "They’ve also asked that the government fully implement the regular review of high-impact regulations. They’ve asked that there be a review of the regulatory implementation process at all government agencies and delegated administrative authorities, DAAs, including organizations and government agencies like the Technical Standards and Safety Authority, Stewardship Ontario, Ontario Electronic Stewardship, Ontario Tire Stewardship and others. The CFIB has also asked the government to rebrand the online regulatory feedback form, make the tool permanent and improve services offered through bizpal.ca.", "Again, I would recommend to the minister over the course of this debate that he look at all of these recommendations, not just implementing half of the first one and calling it a success on the part of the government.", "But I looked at this bill in the broader sense, and we’ve talked about it in terms of the economic climate that this bill is being introduced in and also some of the other economic competitiveness challenges that we face in the province of Ontario.", "As I’ve discussed in the past, in our riding we have an issue in terms of traffic congestion through the community of Morriston in Puslinch township. I should really begin by acknowledging and paying tribute to a good friend of mine, the former mayor of Puslinch township, Brad Whitcombe, who passed away tragically this past weekend. Brad was a good friend. He was an outstanding mayor of the township of Puslinch. He was a warden of the county of Wellington. He was really an outstanding community leader in our riding. He passed away so suddenly; it’s a shock to all of us. I know that I pass along, certainly, the condolences of my family and of all in the House who knew him. He was a great man.", "He advocated for the Morriston bypass very effectively through the years, and I worked with him on this issue. But as we know the Minister of Transportation is in the process of finalizing and preparing the southern highways program, the updated five-year plan for new construction for highways.", "I’d like to again put on the record some of the concerns of my community as well as some of the adjacent ridings. We would argue that this is not just an issue for Puslinch township and Wellington county, but it’s a huge issue for the Hamilton and Niagara regions because it involves the access of Hamilton traffic to the 401. Obviously the pressure point is in the community of Morriston in Puslinch township, which has become the bottleneck, but at the same time that affects a big part of the province of Ontario, and I again look to the adjacent MPPs, some of whom are in the House right now. I see the Minister of Municipal Affairs; I appreciate his efforts in the past to advocate for this project. I see the member for Cambridge who is here; I believe she’s very supportive as well. We’re trying to work to get this on the five-year plan.", "The Morriston Bypass Coalition was here in October. They put these facts to the government. A recent University of Waterloo study on the southern Highway 6 corridor estimates that daily commuter traffic is more than 22,500 vehicles annually—that’s more than eight million vehicles—and annual commercial traffic is between 930,000 and 1.2 million vehicles.", "An analysis of Statistics Canada trucking commodity origin destination data illustrates that the corridor—again, Highway 6 through Puslinch township—is a key link in our trade with the United States, with up to 150 million kilograms of goods being transported to the eastern United States along the route each year. While the posted speed limit on Highway 6 through Morriston is 50 kilometres an hour, the peak speed reached is only 34 kilometres per hour on weekdays between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Mr. Speaker, if you had the opportunity to see this, you wouldn’t believe it, because the traffic is sometimes lined up for kilometres and travelling at a snail’s pace through this small community.", "The Morriston bypass project would alleviate ever-worsening traffic issues in our area, saving local businesses and commuters more than $15 million a year today and more than $30 million per year by 2031. The estimated value of commuter traffic and commercial travel time saved during peak periods with the proposed bypass applied to 2011 traffic would be $15.3 million. By 2031, the annual value of commuter and commercial time saved during peak periods with the proposed bypass is more than $30 million.", "Again, I would suggest that this is important information relevant to the debate of Bill 7, because it deals with economic competitiveness, and certainly the government would argue that Bill 7 is all about trying to make the economy more competitive. We need this project in our riding to make the province more competitive.", "Despite the long-acknowledged need for the essential infrastructure by the government, construction of the Morriston bypass is now decades overdue. The province acknowledged the need to reroute Highway 6 more than 30 years ago, following an initial study that began in 1978, and the Morriston bypass project was presented to the Ministry of Transportation going back to 1994.", "In January 2009, the Ministry of Transportation received environmental assessment approval for the new route from the Ministry of the Environment. That was after a meeting that we had here at Queen’s Park with representatives of Puslinch township council and the Minister of the Environment of the day, John Gerretsen, that I had set up and arranged. We were very pleased to get the support of the Minister of the Environment, but that is now five years ago, Mr. Speaker, and we’re concerned that every year that goes by, this environmental assessment—someone along the line is going to say it’s stale-dated, and force us all back to the drawing board. Surely the government can move more quickly than that, and it should.", "In a letter to the Guelph Mercury newspaper published in April 2010, the Liberal MPP for Guelph, who is now the Minister of Education, wrote a letter to the editor. She was quoted in this letter saying, “The transportation ministry is actively working on this project, and the Morriston bypass will be built.” I appreciate the support that the member for Guelph has demonstrated publicly for this project, and I would encourage her to continue to speak up for the need for it, because this issue affects Guelph and benefits Guelph, I would argue, as much as it benefits my riding.", "Despite all of the past assurances from the government, the Morriston bypass unfortunately is not currently listed as a planned project in the ministry’s five-year investment plan, or what we call the southern highways program. But, again, we are trying to get it on the plan.", "Businesses have made significant investments in our area on the understanding that the government was moving forward, or will be moving forward, with the Morriston bypass. But with every passing year of inaction, the success of these investments and the jobs that they are have generated, quite frankly, are put in jeopardy. Opened in 2005, for example, Tim Hortons’ Guelph facility has approximately 500 employees. Each year, more than 4,600 trips are made along the Highway 6 corridor to and from the facility.", "Maple Leaf Foods has a new 282,000-square-foot distribution centre in Puslinch township and a 402,000-square-foot prepared meats facility currently under construction in Hamilton that will ship approximately $200 million in goods along the Highway 6 corridor each year. It’s my understanding that there have been meetings at the highest level within the government, with a Maple Leaf Foods’ senior executive and with the Premier, urging—obviously, because of the significant investment, that Maple Leaf Foods has made in our area—that they need the Morriston bypass to be built. Of course, Maple Leaf Foods is part of the Morriston Bypass Coalition.", "Canada Bread, in 2011, invested $100 million to help build Canada’s largest commercial bakery in Hamilton. Supporting 300 full-time jobs, the bakery ships approximately $24 million worth of goods along the Highway 6 corridor each year. Of course, as you can imagine, the bread being shipped from the plant, stuck in that long lineup that’s kilometres long through Morriston—obviously, we need to do something about it, and the solution is to build the Morriston bypass.", "We have Nestlé Waters Canada located in Puslinch township. It is Canada’s largest bottled water manufacturer and distributor. Its 900,000-square-foot facility in Guelph employs approximately 300 people and ships $10 million to $15 million worth of goods annually through Morriston. They are part of the coalition as well. They are pushing for the Morriston bypass, and we are working together.", "In terms of the Morriston residents: With their local main street serving double duty as a major transportation artery for the province of Ontario, local residents have legitimate concerns about the safety and well-being of their families. This section of Highway 6 has a much-higher-than-normal crash rate, with approximately 47% more collisions than the provincial average. Since 1994, 22 people have lost their lives on this stretch of highway, with four people killed, tragically, in head-on collisions since 2004.", "I’ve met on numerous occasions with Bill Knetsch, who is the owner of the fine restaurant that we have in Morriston called Enver’s, that many of you will have heard of. It’s often written up in Toronto Life as an outstanding destination restaurant. Morriston restaurant owner Bill Knetsch said residents take their lives in their hands trying to cross the main street. Having witnessed a number of serious collisions himself, he shudders whenever he sees children riding bicycles along the roadway.", "I would totally agree, having been privileged to represent Puslinch township now for a number of years, first between 1990 and 1999. After redistribution in 1999, I was no longer the MPP for Puslinch, and it was represented by other members, including the now member for Guelph. The fact is, I have again resumed responsibility for Puslinch township as a result of the redistribution in 2007 and have really tried to do everything I possibly can to advocate in this House.", "We have a very good case that we’ve made. The Morriston Bypass Coalition actually came together as a result of a suggestion and a recommendation by the former Minister of Transportation at the time, Bob Chiarelli. We had a good meeting two or three years ago with representatives of township council. The minister said to us at that time, “Get the business community to speak up. If you want this road built, you’ve got to bring people together and get the business community to speak up and push for the economic arguments.” Well, we’ve done that, Mr. Speaker. We’ve done it, and I think we’ve done it very effectively. We have this large coalition of big businesses. There are hundreds of jobs in play here. Surely to goodness the government is going to finally realize the importance of this project and get it on the five-year plan.", "In closing, Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank you for your indulgence on this important issue of Bill 7. I appreciate it. I look forward to the continued debate on Bill 7." ],

On the surface, people would argue that if you’re trying to find a way to make sure that you have a strong regulatory system that protects the environment, protects health and safety but does it in a way that is able to make it a little bit easier to navigate through—I don’t think anybody would be opposed to that.", "The government is making a big fanfare with this particular bill and this particular initiative, but when you read the bill, it’s a two-page bill. It essentially gives the government the powers it currently has, which is kind of an odd thing to do.", "First of all, the government has delegated the authority of the Legislature to cabinet in most of their legislation. Whatever bill goes into cabinet, the regulations are written by cabinet, and that’s something that has been delegated.", "What this particular bill also does is it raises the question about how we write regulations. The problem in the way we do regulations now is, because it’s done by cabinet, often those people who need to know, who want to be involved in the regulatory process, may or may not be part of that process, because it’s by invitation only of the cabinet and of the minister responsible.", "I think it begs the question: Should we be thinking about how we’re better able to review regulations as they’re written—or after they’re written, at the regs and private bills committee, a committee that is specifically struck in order to look at regulations? Currently, the ability for members to review regulations is quite limited, and I think it raises an interesting point: that if the government was truly serious about being transparent, it would find some kind of way to take that whole regulatory thing out of the dark and put it under the light, where it needs to be." ],

Ontario ranked number two in North America in terms of information, communication and technology.

He has served consistently and honourably since 1990. I think one of the reasons he does is his ability to work with all sides of the House. His advocacy on behalf of the Morriston bypass just reinforces that for me. It is an incredible amount of tenacity that, with very few exceptions, he is able to tie every legislative proposal that comes forward into the value of the Morriston bypass.

We have the ability, or the minister has the ability, to set up different protocols for cluster development. I would say that maybe a more focused approach would be something that would call on the government to develop a national manufacturing plan or a provincial manufacturing plan in conjunction with partners at the federal level, something that’s being called for not only by the manufacturing industry, specifically automotive, but also by workers’ groups, whether they be union or otherwise, that are telling us, as lawmakers, that we’re missing the boat. We’re not really doing anything when it comes to attracting investment and consolidating. Whether it be regulatory burdens or incentive programs, we’re not doing enough. It’s too fragmented and the province needs a strategy.

I remember these times well, because at that time I was working in the automotive industry in Niagara. As many of you know, Niagara was the centre of economic activity that fuelled the entire province.", "During that period, we developed some of the strongest industries in the entire country and lots of clusters. A large majority of the cars this country built and exported to the world were made right in the place I call home, Niagara. We made these cars out of steel produced in Ontario, in Hamilton. We used resources drawn right here in Ontario. A few decades ago, there was massive economic development happening right across this great province, and I witnessed it first-hand.", "This bill discusses clusters, which it describes as a region of activity where related businesses work together to thrive. This was the steel manufacturing cluster in Hamilton, industrial sectors in Windsor and tourism in Niagara. These clusters developed on the backs of hard-working people of this great province.", "Businesses looking to expand knew that Ontario provided the smartest, most dedicated and hard-working people you could find. They knew we had the capacity to take their businesses, to innovate, to have resources close by, to keep transportation costs low and to work with local companies to bring them to the next level. Without government interference, these businesses used their surroundings to expand.", "Quite frankly, when businesses did well, people did well. When the automotive sector was booming, people in Niagara were doing well. They were employed. They had decent, well-paying jobs. They could put in a good day of hard work and come home with a well-earned paycheque. This is the same story for the hard-working people of Ontario, from our resource industry clusters in the north to the industrial clusters in the south. As many of you know, the last decade has not been the same story unfortunately.", "But these examples highlight the importance of developing our regional clusters. We do this through government support, by listening to our key stakeholders and by reducing unnecessary government regulations that stop businesses from coming to Ontario. The more businesses we can bring to Ontario, the better chance we’ll have to develop these regional clusters. The stronger the development, the better it is for the taxpayers of this province.", "Mr. Speaker, when it comes to Ontario, there is no reason why business shouldn’t want to be here. We still have industrial buildings, which were so busy years ago, ready to be used again. We have an educated population, full of young workers who just want to work. I’ve met with these young people in my riding. It is incredible how smart they are, how dedicated they are and the hours they will put in to get the job done. When I talk to my colleagues here today, there are a lot of young people working for MPPs in this room, and I don’t think anybody would ever argue how hard they work on our behalf.", "We have got the resources and the infrastructure here to make our companies successful. The question becomes, how do we support these businesses? This bill proposes two ways. First is to reduce the burdens that might stop companies from coming to Ontario. The second is to encourage clusters so their development is quicker and much stronger.", "So let’s take a look at the first half of the bill. Reducing burdens is a good thing, so long as we know what they are. This bill defines this as “the purpose of the statutory, regulatory, procedural, administrative or other requirement that creates the cost.”", "If this bill is well-meaning, that is a good thing. I’ll repeat that: If this bill is well-meaning, this is a good thing. If I’m reading this language right, this means that anything which cannot justify the cost paid for it should be eliminated. This is a statement that, at face value, is well-meaning. We just need to make sure we’re not being unreasonable. Of course, there are a few things the current government has done which I believe can be eliminated, but I won’t discuss that here.", "Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to thank the staff from the Ministry of Economic Development. Yesterday, they had some of their very talented and intelligent staff sit down with me and brief me on the contents of this bill. They explained that the language referred to shortening forms that may have become pointless over the years.", "Obviously, we do not want businesses having to cut through tons and tons of red tape if they want to set up shop right here in Ontario. But we have to be clear: It has to be unnecessary red tape. Of course, this bill isn’t entirely clear as to what the Minister of Economic Development will consider to be unreasonable burdens.", "I made this clear as well: We support removing any of the burdens that may exist because of too much paperwork or outdated policies. We just want to make sure the bill says that. If not, Mr. Speaker, there could be issues around regulations and rules that exist to protect workers. Workplace safety regulations come to mind first. I know my colleagues that are here today, and probably all those glued to their televisions back in their offices, are worried about that too. They want safe workplaces across the province of Ontario.", "But I’m worried that instead of helping businesses grow safely, this act is a smokescreen that will scale back safety laws that protect our workers. According to this bill, the minister could say we’re paying too much to keep our workers safe in their work environments. Maybe the minister feels that instead of investing in our businesses here in Ontario, he can cut costs by cutting out regulations that companies are forced to have to keep our workers safe—the same safety regulations, Mr. Speaker, that workers have fought for decades to have. They’re not in place to be inconvenient. They are in place to make sure that no man and no woman—and, in some cases, some of our young children that go and work part-time as they’re going to school—ever has to worry about maybe not coming home, as we’ve seen in this province before.", "There are examples of this all across the province of Ontario. As the member from Nickel Belt has mentioned before, there are serious concerns with the Liberal government and their love affair with private clinics that outsource medical care to private buyers. They’re setting up shop faster than we can keep track of them, yet they are running around proper health and safety standards.", "I had the privilege just the other day to go and talk to our brothers and sisters at ONA, right down here at the Westin. They had a thousand nurses and workers. I had a chance to talk to them. You know what they told us and what they informed us of, what their convention was about and what they said to our labour minister from the Liberal Party? They told him the number one issue in their workplace is safety and how they were being hurt on the job.When you look at sectors—you look at the steel sector, at the auto sector—you would think that’s where all the injuries are happening. The number one workplace is with nurses, getting hurt on the job.", "So yes, reducing red tape has allowed private health clinics to open up quickly and allowed them to take Ontarians’ hard-earned money, and put their health at risk. You only have to talk to ONA on that issue, and the nurses who do an incredible, incredible job for all of us every day.", "Instead of people going to clinics to get healthy, they’re actually getting sicker. Think about it: health clinics not following health regulations. Let me say this again: I’m all for reducing unneeded burdens that allow businesses to open right here in Ontario. But we can’t support it if the minister is going to use this clause to slash and burn regulations that keep our people safe and healthy in our workplaces across the province of Ontario.", "On paper, it looks great. And quite frankly, it’s a page and a half, this bill. Like I said, I was thrilled to get the opportunity to talk for an hour on a page and a half. But it wasn’t the page and a half that concerned me; it was what was trying to be said in that page and a half. So on paper it looks great. The government lets a private clinic set up shop. They open quickly; the government overpays the developers; and in the end we pick up the costs when things go wrong.", "Regulations need to be closely examined before they are slashed. This bill provides nothing up front to address that issue. It gives the minister the authority to slash regulations and report on them after the fact. We need provisions that protect citizens and employees.", "Let’s take a look at another issue, one raised by the MPP from Kitchener–Waterloo. We have a serious issue in this province where our young workers are being put in dangerous situations involving heights. There’s no legislation that demands that employers do their part and properly give their workers height training. We see young workers, our sons and our daughters, our grandkids, workers who are out there striving to get a job, who are afraid—and my daughters have told me this—to refuse unsafe work, getting injured and killed in the workplace. We can’t be cutting burdens like that when it comes to training and regulations. Certainly, we need to implement regulations to save workers’ lives. When it comes to getting business here in Ontario, let’s support them. Let’s make sure there are no unnecessary burdens to overcome, but let’s make sure this bill isn’t used as a wholesale deregulation of very important standards.", "It could be the case that some health and safety training that is regulated costs money. But companies that say that need to ask themselves a more important question. This is important. If you ask the businesses across the province in Ontario, they’ll tell you the same thing: What is the cost of paying an injured worker or going to court? On the face of it, it may look like removing certain burdens would save money, but realistically, having some regulations and restrictions helps to make sure some companies aren’t paying much higher fees later on.", "That’s what I’d say when it comes to the definition of a burden. If you’re discussing removing procedures that are costly and unnecessary, let’s get it done. Let’s do it. Let’s make sure it’s easy for business to open up shop in my riding in Niagara, in Sudbury and in Toronto. But let’s make sure we’re not opening the doors for companies to skip over regulations and put the people of Ontario at risk. Let’s make sure we legislate where we must to protect people and remove burdens where we can to foster better businesses and business growth here in Ontario.", "We never want to see a person get injured or even killed because there was not enough analysis done when it comes to removing a regulation. If we do this right, we can create an Ontario where businesses have no fear of unnecessary regulations, but also where workers and everyday citizens can sleep at night knowing that proper safety regulations are being followed. I believe, at the end of the day, that becomes a win-win for everybody. That’s where we should go.", "The first part of the bill is interesting. It requires that the minister submit a report to this Legislature every year on the work they’ve been doing to reduce unnecessary burdens. Like I said before, this bill is pretty vague in its language. The definition it offers of burdens can be looked at in a number of ways. If the minister were to clarify in the act how this government is going to distinguish between what a regulation is, a burden necessary to protect the public interest, and what burdens are unnecessary costs to businesses—that’s what this act should be looking at. Then I would feel a whole lot better.", "Clarifying this act is the best way to make sure we’re eliminating what isn’t necessary and keeping what is vitally important. I fear that one report always made after the fact will be quite lengthy and oftentimes far too late. In the case of our clinics or our workers, a report after the fact would reverse the side effects of mass deregulation.", "When you take a look at the bill, it says that the report will be done sometime before June 30, but when you follow closer into the language, the language says, “but it may be extended.” The word “may,” in the world I come from, is a very soft word when it comes to language. You always like to say “shall”; you like to see something like that. What could happen in the report: The report could be done on June 30 one year and the next year you’re expecting another report on June 30, but they could extend it to December 31 because that constitutes a year. You have to have some concerns around that.", "The other concern I have around the reporting: Wouldn’t it make a lot more sense that, before you do anything and eliminate any regulations or put any hardships onto the business—why wouldn’t we do the report before, and have that discussion and make sure what they’re doing is something that makes sense to all of us?", "The example I got yesterday from my colleagues was WSIB. You can talk about WSIB in this room for probably hours, on the problems that we have there. But on the forms what they’re saying is, “One of the things that’s really giving us a hiccup is that somebody may get injured on the job, but there’s no lost time involved.” They didn’t get off the job. They didn’t lose, really, any time on the job, yet they have to fill out this long, long form on exactly what happened. They said that they would like to see that form shortened. Well, that would make a little bit of sense. I could understand that.", "Those types of things we could have, but it would be nice, before we see the report, if we actually had that dialogue. I think for everybody in this House—if they could make it a shorter form from a long form, I don’t think that’s an issue. That’s my concern with the reporting, we’re going to get it all after the fact, so clarifying this in the act is the best way to make sure we’re eliminating what isn’t necessary and keeping what is vitally important. I fear one report—always made after the fact—will be quite lengthy, so I’m concerned about that.", "Let’s make sure we make Ontario the best place in North America to invest. We all know our problems with people finding jobs. We’ve got everything an investor could want. I want to repeat that for my colleagues across so they hear it quite well: We’ve got everything an investor could want right here in Ontario. We have manufacturing, we have natural resources, and most importantly—and I’ve heard this coming from folks from all around the world—we have the smartest, most dedicated and the hardest-working workers in the world. There is no reason Ontario cannot be the economic powerhouse it has historically been. We need to work with businesses and workers alike to make that a reality.", "If we have smart and dedicated economic development, we can finally lift Ontario out of the slump that has existed since the financial downturn and give people the work they deserve. That’s in the first part of the bill, which is removing government from the process, where it makes sense, and allowing businesses the opportunity to set up and grow here in Ontario—that used to be a commercial. Do you remember that? “Set up and grow in Ontario.” Maybe I’m the only one who remembers that. Maybe I’m showing my age here; I’m not sure. I didn’t get any feedback over there; they didn’t even pay attention to that one. I thought that was a good line: Set up and grow here in Ontario. That’s what we need.", "The second part of the bill actually puts the government back into the process. The second part of this bill deals with clusters. For those of you who are unaware, according to this legislation, clusters tend to be considered geographic groupings of similar businesses. We all understand that. At first glance, it may just look like a few groups decide to set up shop in the same area, but identifying and nurturing these clusters is far more important than that. When a group of businesses cluster together we see some great things when it comes to economic growth. By being situated close together, there is an increase in competition, but not always just competition, oftentimes collaboration as well, which is equally important. By being so close to one another, these businesses tend to be innovative and grow off of one another.", "So when these clusters start to form, the best and the brightest who work in these industries that are being developed move in to the region. When they move to the area, more businesses are attracted to come to these centres of innovation and take advantage of these employees or, just as important, the resource base. A pool of working, wherever it is made, makes a certain geographic area attractive, whether that be up north, whether it be in Kitchener–Waterloo or whether it be in Niagara. The more businesses that come, the more jobs they make. I think we all understand that. That’s what the idea of the cluster is. The larger the businesses, the more competition, the more innovation and so on, as it goes. So you can see why developing these clusters is a good thing. Probably one of the most famous examples is Silicon Valley in the United States.", "Mr. Speaker, right here in Ontario—right here in Ontario—we have a number of clusters that provide some of Ontario’s best jobs, well-paying—things that we need right here. Two great examples are the IT cluster in the Waterloo area and the automotive cluster in Windsor, and in Niagara, my area of the province of Ontario.", "In St. Catharines, we have a General Motors plant that employs 2,000 people, both union and non-union. The plant builds a V6 engine. It has engine lines and assembly lines. But what happens when an automotive plant is in your area? The plant employs people who live in St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Welland, Port Colborne—the entire area. Basically every city in the region would have employees there. But there’s support there it builds off of.", "There’s a CAMI plant, which turns out the Equinox and the Terrain. So you can see, that’s a bit of a cluster. If you talk to the workers down there, they have a lot of parts suppliers that are supplying to that plant. Well, CAMI has about 3,000 employees, and they say that every automotive industry job creates another six to seven spinoff jobs, direct and indirect jobs—very important clusters.", "I’m going to tell you a quick story about a plant. It’s called SpencerARL. It does logistics for the transmission plant in Niagara. Now this was a plant that came into Niagara Falls, and they were awarded the job of supplying to General Motors, doing some inspection, doing some of that stuff for them. They started with 11 employees—11. As we showed the highly skilled workforce that we had here—people in the manufacturing sector who unfortunately had lost their jobs in places like Hayes-Dana or Edscha—they saw that they had workers right in Niagara who had the experience to work in the automotive sector who understood what it’s like to work in a plant, who understood what it was like to work shift work.", "I don’t know how many in this room have worked shift work. Shift work is not always easy. It’s not easy on the family. Trying to get your kids to hockey when you’re working shift work—a lot of that responsibility would fall on one of the parents, one of the partners of the relationship, male or female. Because in a lot of cases in these workplaces today, there are women working there. There are men working there. Some are working in the same plant, and they’re all taking their kids to different stuff. But SpencerARL is a good example of what a cluster can do.", "So General Motors awarded a new transmission line to the St. Catharines plant, and I believe it was close to a $600-million investment in St. Catharines—all good news. General Motors made that decision. I believe—like I think everybody in the room does, all my colleagues here—that we have some of the most talented workers in the world right here. We know how to build cars in this country. We’re the best.", "But SpencerARL started at 11. Today, Mr. Speaker, do you know how many employees they have there? I know you’re dying for me to tell you, because you’re looking right at me. Three hundred—300 employees. They’ve grown from 11—by the way, all unionized; that was never an issue at this company, which I think I like to say. They came in and they sat down with the union when they had 11. We hammered out a collective agreement, and I can say a very good collective agreement, because I bargained it with the company across the table. They were excited to come to Ontario. They were excited to open up in Niagara Falls. It was the first manufacturing—I was on city council as well in Niagara Falls—to come to Niagara Falls in close to 20 years, and they grew from 11 to 300. That’s what the cluster is about, quite frankly.", "They’re 12 minutes away from the plant, so just-in-time is nice and easy. We can talk about the infrastructure that we need to fix to help businesses as well; we can’t be stuck on the highway, on the 401, all the time. But this is a plant that’s 11 or 12 minutes away. Just on time, they get the parts there. It’s absolutely incredible what’s happened. But they grew from 11 to 30 because of a cluster, because General Motors made a business decision to come to St. Catharines and the surrounding area—SpencerARL being the case here—and grew from 11 to 30. I think that’s what we’re talking about when we talk about clusters.", "The offshoot to that was that there’s another company that, because the basement in General Motors was empty and because of, again—I didn’t participate in this—the bargaining of the union, they agreed to utilize the open space in the basement to have another company come there. They’re called Offsite. What happened is that they came into the basement and the same thing happened: They started with 12, maybe 14, employees. They’re now up to 80.", "As a cluster grows, what happens? It’s a highly skilled workforce, so they’re excited to come to Ontario. Why wouldn’t you be? It’s a great province. So the clusters can certainly work, and I think I’ve given you two pretty good examples.", "Now, I don’t know the names of the companies, but there are tool and die shops that have now come in and that are now doing work within the area. As you see the automotive cluster, you see how it grew. We went from, say, 11 employees at SpencerARL, 11 employees in the basement, to where now we’re talking 400 employees making what I would consider a fair wage with fair benefits, working in the province of Ontario and taking home a paycheque to their families. I think that’s all good news for us. I certainly believe, on our side of the House, that we can support that. Why wouldn’t we support it? It’s putting our kids and our grandkids to work.", "The big thing in Niagara is that some of the other plants closed, like Dana, like Edscha, where they lost jobs, they’ve now been put back to work doing the same thing they’ve done their entire life because of the cluster and because of a decision, and, quite frankly, through the support of the Ontario government, that we were able to negotiate a brand new transmission line in the St. Catherines plant, and now the cluster is growing. Tool and die, inspection, machine shops: It’s absolutely great.", "I wanted to tell that story because I think it talks to the bill on how clusters can work. They certainly can work in Niagara around automotive.", "I can talk about tourism because I have a few minutes left. It looks like I have lots of minutes left, so I’ve got lots of time to talk. It’s one of the things I enjoy doing. We can talk about tourism, and I’ll do that for a minute.", "The reason why I’m going to do that is because I think it’s important. We’re going back a few years to 1995, in that area; it might be 1994, but it’s back a bit. As you get older, your memory isn’t quite as good, but it’s in that area. There was a decision made to build a casino in Niagara Falls. It’s going to create 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 jobs when it’s up and running. It’s a good-news story, right? It’s tourism. I’d ask my colleagues, how many have been to Niagara Falls here? I think everybody has been to Niagara Falls. Right?" ],

What it did is it created a cluster of other businesses, direct and indirect. You know what I said about the automotive sector? That’s exactly what happened in tourism. Now you need somebody to supply the food, so now you have a group that is doing that.", "What happened in Niagara Falls and, I believe, put it on the map just outside of the falls, was that billions and billions of dollars were invested in new hotels in Niagara Falls, creating thousands and thousands of jobs—again, a tourism cluster, something that we needed.", "Quite frankly, I’m going to make a pitch. The city of Niagara Falls, while I was sitting on city council—we’re happy with the two that we have. We believe there should be more investment in upgrading one of our casinos, but we believe there is room for another casino in Niagara Falls. That’s one thing we think we should work at. The other thing is that we had a cluster in Fort Erie, the same type of thing around tourism.", "Now, think about what we’re saying here, because the bill is talking about clusters. We have an automotive cluster, we have an IT cluster, we have a tourism cluster. In Fort Erie, we had a cluster. They had the slots in Fort Erie, and the slots, through their revenue, were providing some revenue for the racetrack. You know how that all worked. It created 300 jobs, and then it created jobs in the hotel sector, the restaurants and all the local businesses. So now you’re creating four and five more jobs.", "The problem that we had with that particular cluster is—and a decision that I’m hoping, at some point in time, we can sit down with the government and get changed—let’s reopen that casino and continue to have that cluster and those jobs.", "At the racetrack, there were 1,000 jobs: 700 direct, 300 indirect. The casino, the slots part of it, had almost 300 jobs. Revenue was going to the council. Some of the revenue was going to help with the purses at the track.", "What happens with that cluster? Who wins? The government of Ontario wins, because they’re getting tax dollars, which we know we need from looking at where we’re at. We create jobs at the slots. We create jobs at the racetrack. We create jobs at the local businesses, the local restaurants and the local malls. That’s how the cluster should work.", "Tourism can be an extremely important cluster right across the province of Ontario. We know what it does for Toronto, with the tourists who are here—it’s incredible every day—from all over the world. So the clusters can work. I know I got a little bit off topic there, but I think it’s important to talk about how clusters can work and put people back to work.", "I didn’t talk—and I should, I guess, for the people who are from Toronto. I don’t know how many are in the room today who are from Toronto. There’s an auto plant right here on the highway in Oakville. It’s a very good plant, Local 707, producing great products. They just had a big announcement of more jobs down there. They’re running full out. It’s a really good local, a really good plant: high quality, highly skilled.", "What happens in Oakville—I saw you put your hand up. What happens in Oakville? It’s the same thing. Right? In the plants there, the workers are going to work six, seven days a week. The skilled trades are in there working. What happens outside?

The bill is particularly vague—and that’s my concern with the bill—when it comes to the language around it and the support of the clusters. Remember, I used that example: “may” and “shall.” That’s why it’s important to have strong language when you put a bill together: “We shall do this.” “We shall do that.” “We may do a report once a year” or “We can extend that report”—those types of things are not, and why I say it’s vague.", "This bill says, “Ontario can act as a catalyst to spur the development of clusters. By working with businesses and other entities to develop plans with respect to the development of clusters, Ontario can promote the growth of jobs and the economy.” It sounds great, doesn’t it?

I support this province acting as a prime supporter of our businesses’ clusters and working with key players in those sectors to create a strong development of our economy. I’m sure my colleagues heard that.", "Mr. Speaker, maybe this bill means a big shift in policy from the Liberal government of two weeks ago.", "Some time ago, Ford approached the province of Ontario with a plan. It was going to develop a small fuel-efficient engine right here in Ontario. It was going to tap into the manufacturing cluster that exists in Windsor—I never talked about that cluster, but there is a really good cluster in Windsor—use our hard workers, use our access to resources, our industrial strength. They were going to expand their operations to produce that engine right here in Ontario. By tapping into the manufacturing sector in Windsor, they were going to create 1,000 jobs.", "We’ve got economists who say that for every one job created directly in the automotive plant, there are six spinoff jobs—some say it’s as high as eight—created for the economy. So for 1,000 jobs, that’s an extra 6,000 people, roughly, who would go back to work, and in this case, including the 460 people who are on layoff currently in that plant. I talked to their chairperson yesterday about this, and he agrees: We have to be more proactive; we have to sit down and make sure, with all the stakeholders, so that we’re getting in the front door of these investments and finding out how we can make sure that when companies are going to invest, they’re going to invest right here in Ontario. I think it’s important that all the stakeholders do that and find the best way to be more proactive than reactive to these types of investments.

Research showed that there were dozens of children in Halton and Hamilton who were going without adequate food over the weekend, and so an idea was born to help those little ones.", "It’s simple. It all starts with plastic bags and boxes of food to fill those bags. Here’s how it works: Every Thursday afternoon, staff and volunteers gather at the Food4Kids offices. In the backroom are boxes filled with fresh fruit, healthy snacks and juice boxes. On the evening I was there, each of us picked up a bag, filled it with one item of food from each of the boxes and then sealed the bag and dropped it off into a bin. We did this over and over again for several hours. In very little time, we had managed to stuff over 140 bags with an assortment of fresh fruit and vegetables, along with a mixture of the healthy snacks.", "Once filled, the packages are distributed to local schools every Friday morning for needy kids. The unmarked bags are then placed directly into students’ backpacks.

It’s appropriate that we stand today to debate this bill in the House, as November is Lung Month.", "I want to begin by once again welcoming and acknowledging the many stakeholders who are in the gallery today and who have actually been introduced twice. We recognize these individuals along with many others who work tirelessly to advocate for all Ontarians—and their families—who suffer from a variety of lung diseases. I can fully appreciate the fact that they are here in support of this bill, and they were here in the House as I introduced it yesterday as well. I want to acknowledge the hard work they’ve done as lung health partners in assisting with this bill.", "It takes collaboration amongst our many partners concerned with lung health issues to make changes to reduce the risk of developing lung disease. The Ontario Lung Association and their many partners involved in lung health have done tremendous work in advocating for legislative changes over these years, making a significant difference in lung health for all Ontarians.", "Speaker, this past spring I went to the Run aLung event in my riding of Cambridge. It was created for Kayla Baker, an extraordinary teenager who had battled cancer, then pulmonary fibrosis, had received a double lung transplant at the last minute, then lost her fight to regain her health. Her story touched our entire community and many did the five-kilometre run in support of her.", "After the run I met with her mother, Susan Tremblett, to discuss our shared experiences about raising children who needed a double lung transplant. My own son Rory was fortunate that he narrowly avoided a lung transplant, as his lung health improved enough during extensive treatment in hospital for his lung disease. I promised Susan that if I were elected I would do everything in my power to try to influence health policy in Ontario regarding lung health and to continue to raise awareness about lung health, the importance of prevention of lung-related diseases, and promote the importance of organ donation in Ontario.", "It was actually at this event that I first met George Habib, the president and CEO of the Ontario Lung Association, who is here today. We spoke at length about our shared concerns, shared passion for improving lung health for Ontarians and shared vision for the government to look at any new legislation through a lung health lens. He asked me to sign the 4 Lung Years Pledge as a candidate in this past June 12 provincial election. I promised that, if elected, I would not only support a comprehensive lung health action plan for Ontario, but that I would present it as my private member’s bill. Today, I’m very proud to keep that promise.", "Speaker, this bill seeks to establish the Lung Health Advisory Council for the purpose of making recommendations to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care regarding research, prevention and treatment of lung disease, and would raise lung health awareness about the risk factors that contribute to developing lung disease.", "Chronic disease continues to be a growing economic burden on Ontario’s health care system, and lung disease accounts for a significant and disproportionate portion of these costs. Lung disease is a leading cause of health care utilization, including hospitalizations, emergency department visits and admissions. Currently in Ontario, there are more than 2.4 million people living with a serious lung disease, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD, lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension and cystic fibrosis. This represents approximately one in five of all Ontarians. The current direct and indirect cost to the Ontario economy of these three diseases is estimated to be more than $4 billion and is anticipated to grow by a whopping $310 billion in 30 years. However, there are currently available solutions that could be implemented immediately. Prevention, early diagnosis and treatment can lead to positive health outcomes.", "Better care in the community can and does prevent emergency department and hospital visits, admissions and re-admissions, as I well know as a former care coordinator for the CCAC. Our community team of health professionals was able to intervene with several patients many times on my caseload to prevent further hospital admissions.", "Unfortunately, lung disease does not currently get the same attention as other chronic diseases and illnesses in Ontario. Of the four chronic diseases responsible for 79% of all deaths in the province, from cancers, cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases and diabetes, only lung disease is without a dedicated, coordinated, province-wide effort to minimize the health and economic burden of the disease. Health Quality Ontario plainly states that where there is a “clear strategy to improve results,” progress, such as a reduction in expensive hospitalizations and better quality of life, follows. A coordinated and integrated approach to advancing Ontario’s lung health is very necessary.", "Caring for countless patients of all ages with breathing problems and lung disease for over 30 years as a nurse led to a lifelong concern about lung health and a passion, for me, to try to influence health care policy to improve factors that affect it.", "The feeling of being breathless is one of the most frightening experiences anyone can describe. Years ago in the emergency department one afternoon, a nursing colleague of mine was admitted with an acute asthma attack, with such little breath that he was unable to speak. The panic in his blue-tinged face was alarming. He was pulling off the oxygen mask that touched his face, as he felt he was suffocating, and he was thrashing around so much that it was difficult to provide the care and the life-saving treatments he urgently required. With calm and very swift care by our whole emergency team and a great deal of one-on-one reassurance, we were able to narrowly avoid putting him on life support and improve his breathing significantly.", "The next day in the intensive care unit, he tearfully thanked his colleagues for saving his life. He articulated that when he could not breathe, nothing else mattered. He had not previously recognized the severity of his asthma. In fact, he said he probably denied that truth, even as an experienced health professional, and he wasn’t sure or clear on what triggered his severe attacks. He said that more education needed to be done with the public about lung health to bring awareness to risk factors that contribute to lung health conditions.", "Providing care in such emergency care situations, although difficult, was something that, as a critical care nurse, I was well trained to do. For me, the issues of lung health are also very personal. As a mother who raised a child with severe lung disease who was often so short of breath that he could not walk up a flight of stairs or even remain at home for many months at a time, it was extremely difficult for our family to experience. Indeed, my husband, who wished to be here today, was so emotional about this time that he preferred to watch on TV. I understand the need for families caring for their loved ones with lung disease to have the best possible treatments—but more importantly, how best to prevent lung disease in the first place.", "During the almost four years that Rory spent admitted to hospitals in the early 1990s, he was between the ages of 10 and 14. Some of the health care professionals who were involved in his care had a lack of knowledge regarding his condition and what caused it. They couldn’t understand that his complex lung issues also included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, even at such a young age. When he was about 13 years old, again in the early 1990s, during a prolonged nine-month stay at a hospital where he was under continuous observation, a doctor continuously asked him how much he smoked, because it was the only explanation she could think of to account for his severe emphysema. Clearly, there’s more work to do to raise awareness about lung health, prevention and treatment in Ontario.", "As a society, we have actually come a long way in awareness and behavioural issues regarding lung health. It’s hard to believe this now, but when I started at SickKids, down University Avenue, as a new nurse over 30 years ago, there were smoking rooms for parents on each ward in the hospital. Staff could smoke in the cafeteria, doctors could smoke in their offices, and in adult hospitals patients could smoke in their beds.", "Years ago, asthma care was inconsistent, medication regimes were less effective, and asthma attacks caused a great number of pediatric hospital admissions. Indeed, at peak times in the year at Sick Kids hospital, the ward census and number of asthma admissions were reported on daily. A focus on the prevention and treatment of asthma during studies to develop best-practice guidelines and a standard of care right across the province worked, in trying to have a consistent, effective approach to asthma treatment for all Ontarians.", "In my experience, more can be done to make lung health a priority in Ontario, with evidence-based best practices that are communicated to and adopted by health care providers across Ontario. This approach means fewer hospital admissions and improved outcomes for those suffering from lung disease. I’m proud to be part of a government that continues to make changes to protect our lung health, and I look forward to the legislation that will be reintroduced regarding flavoured tobacco.", "Previous legislation passed by this government restricts smoking from restaurants, workplaces, and cars with young children inside, and that further underlines our commitment to reducing smoking-related diseases.", "The support of this government, which followed through on the commitment to close all coal-fired generation plants in Ontario by 2014, has also made a positive difference in the quality of air we all breathe.", "I look forward this afternoon to the debate regarding this bill in this House." ],

I think people listening would be quite stunned to hear of the number of people who suffer from lung disease. To say that it’s going to increase by 50% in the next 30 years is kind of shocking to people.", "We both could probably tell you some awful stories from the hospital. I don’t think that anyone who hasn’t experienced not being able to catch their breath to fill their lungs with air, even a little bit—the panic in those patients is terrifying for us to see as nurses, because it is immediate. As Maslow’s hierarchy of needs says, it’s air first. If you can’t breathe, nothing else matters. It is very terrifying. So anything that we can do to help in the prevention of lung disease, we should be doing.", "She mentioned a coordinated and integrated approach—no question. It is kind of surprising that lung disease is the only major disease that does not have a strategy, so I applaud her for taking her past background as a nurse and bringing this issue forward.", "I know that smoking is a large part of lung disease. I have, in my riding of Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock, one of the higher percentages of people who smoke, at 23.2%, with the Ontario average, which I know the member mentioned, at 17.8%. So we can do a lot better on the education aspect of that and keep assessing the stop-smoking programs that are available, if they’re working, to see what we can do better.", "It always alarms me when I go past high schools and see the number of kids out smoking, especially the number of girls. It’s not an official poll; it’s just me seeing what’s going on in the community, and I’m shocked. Obviously, we need to do something better, and I don’t know what it is out there.", "I can share the nursing story of working the night shift at Toronto General Hospital, just down the road. The nurses smoked on the night shift. Sometimes in the doctors’ offices, once you went in, the ashtray was there, and the doctors were smoking too. So we have come a long way. We do have to do a much better job.", "The nice thing about private members’ bills is we can bring a lot of things forward that are positive for our communities and for the people in the province of Ontario.

Hopefully, as I do this talk, you’ll see why.", "Thank you for allowing me to speak on the issue of lung health in regard to this bill. I’d like to take a moment and talk about one aspect of lung health, and that’s lung cancer. It is an issue that has affected my life and my very dear family.", "But first, let’s start at the beginning: what lung cancer is. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in Canada. There are two types of lung cancer: small-cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer. Both of these grow differently and have different symptoms. If you find lung cancer early enough, there’s a 40% to 50% five-year survival rate, but the problem is that lung cancer is hard to find and sometimes there are almost no symptoms. In advanced lung cancer cases, this drops to around 1% to 5%.", "Some 26,100 Canadians will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year. This represents 14% of all new cancer cases in 2014. On average, 72 Canadians are diagnosed with lung cancer every day. You can put that in perspective right in this chamber: That would mean that everybody in the PC party and the NDP could have lung cancer. Put that in perspective and take a look at what that means.", "According to the Canadian Cancer Society, about one in 12 Canadian men is expected to develop lung cancer during his lifetime, and one in 13 will die from it. About one in 14 Canadian women is expected to develop lung cancer during her lifetime, and one in 17 will die from it. When those people get sick, the province is here to support them, but the best way to fight lung cancer is through prevention. So how do we do this? How do we protect ourselves, our loved ones and those in our community from this terrible disease? The first and best way is either to quit or avoid smoking—and I’ll talk to that later.", "In the last few years, we’ve made great strides in preventing smoking, especially around young people. We have to get to our young people to make sure they don’t start smoking, before they become addicted. Nothing is more heart-wrenching than seeing a young person affected by this disease. Working hard and working together, we’ve managed to scale back those odds, though there’s still work to be done in educating those in the province of Ontario about the dangers of smoking.", "Evidence shows that you’re 10 times more likely to develop lung cancer if you smoke. Think of that for a minute; think about the danger you could be putting yourself into. I’m glad to say that I don’t smoke and never have, but not necessarily some of my family members.", "We’re also starting to discover other things that cause lung cancer. Over the summer, in one of the neighbourhoods in Niagara Falls, we were delighted to have Mike Holmes stop by, whom many of you probably recognize from his work on TV. I went with him to one of our subdivisions to discuss the issue of radon in homes. Mr. Holmes was able to tell me and local residents of the importance of monitoring this odourless, colourless and hard-to-detect gas. It seeps into your house through cracks in the foundation. Though there’s still research to be done, we can tell that some homes with high amounts of radon may be affecting people’s lung health.", "Mr. Holmes is working his way across the country to promote radon awareness and testing for it. He was quick to tell me that some homes might return a test to say there isn’t any, and the house right next to them will be off the charts. I’m not a home construction expert by any means, but if I take my advice from anybody on this issue, it would be from Mr. Holmes.", "Another factor is staying active. We need to make sure our young people—and our seniors, for that matter—are living active and healthy lifestyles.", "These are the sort of things we can do to keep our lungs healthy and keep them safe. If we stop smoking, if we’re aware of the causes and we stay active, then we can dramatically reduce the effects of lung cancer.", "I’m happy we’re discussing this because I do believe that the government plays a role in this. I believe we have a responsibility to monitor the effects of lung disease and do everything we can to educate people and prevent it.", "Unfortunately, I want to close by talking about my own experience. My mother passed away in 1991, 23 years ago, at the tender age of 61. Mom was active in our community. My dad was fortunate enough to work part of his working career at General Motors. From that, there was an organization within the union movement called the Women’s Auxiliary. My mother would go there. They would play cards and darts, and that would be their social connection, and she had a lot of good friends. They really loved each other. My mom ended up being the president of that organization for 20 years, arranging a number of socials. When people went on strike, they’d make sandwiches. Years ago, we used to have a hall, and they used to make the roast beef dinners.", "I can remember telling a story about this. When I was young, nine or 10 years old—and, like today, there were not enough volunteers. So they’re doing a wedding one night and my mom took me to the hall. I was thrilled to go at that young age. I was eight or nine. My mom told me that if I would come, she’d feed me a nice roast beef dinner. For me, that was important. When I got there, I didn’t know I had to wash dishes for three hours to get that roast beef dinner. But having said that, they were preparing the food for a member of the local.", "But unfortunately, my mom got sick. Then we found out that she had lung cancer, and she got really sick, and she lost a lung. The doctor at that time said to her very clearly, “If you want to continue a productive life, you’re going to have to quit smoking.” Our family members, my sister, my brother, our relatives, our circle of friends, would say to my mom, “Mom, you’ve got to quit smoking.” So my mom tried a number of times, but she couldn’t quit smoking. A lot of us have friends, maybe some in this room or some within your caucuses, who smoke and have tried to quit and they couldn’t.", "So what happened? The cancer came back. She had half her lung removed; she had half a lung left. My mom went down to—we’re not very big. You can tell I’m not very big, and my mom was smaller than I am. She went down to 90 pounds, 85 pounds. And we begged her, “Mom, you’ve got to quit smoking. It’s going to kill you.” We went to the doctor with her and the doctor was clear: “Gloria, Gloria, for your family”—my dad had already passed away—“for your grandkids, you have to quit.”", "No matter how hard my mom tried, she couldn’t quit. No matter how much she loved her family, she couldn’t quit. At the end of the day, my mom passed away long before she should have.", "So if there’s any advice I can give with this bill, it’s that we’ve got to tell our young people that when you have that first cigarette, that may be the start of a lifelong battle to stop smoking. Collectively, we have to do everything we can to make sure young people don’t start smoking. For my mom, it’s obviously too late. For people that are listening today, talk to your kids about it, because once you start, most people find it almost impossible to quit—including losing their life.", "Thank you very much for giving me the privilege to talk to your bill." ],

They saw a good young man, and now he’s working for them. It’s great that Chris Yaccato has moved from my office to the Lung Association.", "What is very refreshing as well, recognizing the importance of Bill 41 and the efforts, the actions, the foresight and the willingness of the member from Cambridge—the bill, I can see, is having the support of the entire House, and deservedly so. It’s one of those bills that are hard not to support.", "Briefly, what does the bill do? The unfortunate thing is that I only have a couple of minutes when I really have so much to say about it, as my first granddaughter and daughter-in-law also suffer from asthma. My granddaughter since has moved to BC. She’s a bit better; perhaps the air is better in BC. But I know the effect of that.", "Very clearly, Bill 41 is called the Lung Health Act, 2014. To some, this might not mean very much, so we have the long explanation which the member has provided. The long name actually is “An Act to establish the Lung Health Advisory Council and develop a provincial action plan respecting lung disease.” How wonderful it is. In short, the bill calls for a health advisory council, which would create a provincial lung health plan. Why is that, Speaker? We heard the member say—and it’s worth repeating—that lung disease is the only major chronic disease without a dedicated strategy. If there is one—with many others—it’s the lung disease that should have a strategy. Speaker, you and I and everyone in our province, young or old, we want our lungs healthy for life. We want our lungs healthy for life.", "What does the bill do? Through the council, it is to prevent lung disease, to improve patients’ outcomes and to save health care dollars as well.", "I want to give you a few statistics, and then I’ll go to some of the other views about what the council could do.", "Just to give you an idea, not only the health effects but lung cancer, in 2011, cost the province of Ontario some $293.9 million. In 2021, it will jump to $8 billion; by 2031, it’s $19.6 billion. If I go to 2041, it’s $33.5 billion. If we were to pass this through quickly and get it implemented, I can say without hesitation that this would go a long way in making a difference not only in the health of our people, especially our young people, but also financially for the health care system.", "This has been said before: 2.4 million people in Ontario are living with asthma, COPD or lung cancer. I had to ask the member from Cambridge, “What’s COPD?” People watching the TV would say, “What the heck is Mario talking about, COPD?” It’s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This number is expected to grow to 3.6 million in 30 years.", "There have been significant increases in the prevalence of COPD and asthma in the past two years. Approximately 850,000 Ontarians are living with COPD, and 1.9 million Ontarians with asthma—one in five children. Beyond chronic lung disease, influenza and respiratory infections cause 2% of all deaths in Ontario.", "Also, according to the World Health Organization, lung disease is the third-leading cause of non-communicable-disease deaths in the world. Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer, killing eight out of 10 people who have it.", "I think my time is up, Speaker. As I said, it’s unfortunate that I can’t say much more, because it requires much more, but I want to give some time to other members.", "Again, I want to congratulate the member from Cambridge for bringing this wonderful Bill 41 to the floor of the House and, I hope, speedy passage." ],

We’ve heard about asthma, cystic fibrosis, IPF. It just makes me think of so many people—and I stand on their shoulders. That’s how I want to say that.", "I think of a good friend of mine. We’ve been together for decades. She has dealt with asthma. From time to time, things will trigger her asthma, and she has to rush to the local hospital for Ventolin treatments. I know that scared look that the member for Cambridge referred to. But the other side of the coin is that I also stayed behind to care for their kids as she and her husband went to hospital. It affects everyone. When the kids don’t understand what is happening to their mom when she can’t breathe, that’s something you don’t forget either.", "Then we talk about cystic fibrosis. Again, we stand on the shoulders of people who worked so hard to try and make a difference. I think of our local Kinsmen Clubs. The Teeswater Kinsmen and the Lucknow Kinsmen work so hard to raise money for cystic fibrosis, and I salute them too—in fact, all Kinsmen Clubs across the province.", "In terms of IPF, I was thrilled this past summer to see action on this finally, once and for all. I’ve been reading in petitions for months upon months, in terms of getting some action on consideration of the drug known as Esbriet for people suffering from IPF. I think about Barb, one of the champions who have been to Queen’s Park time and time again. She’s just a wonderful soul. We stand on her shoulders today as we look forward and put our support behind something that has been long needed in Ontario.", "In terms of IPF, I think about those petitions I read in, and I couldn’t help but recognize so many names that stood behind specifically a family and a gentleman from Mildmay, Hugh Detzler. He was a poster child for the need for Esbriet in this province. I was very, very quick to respond in late August on Twitter—and it went around like wildfire—that considerations for qualified sufferers of IPF would now be given in Ontario for the drug Esbriet.

As you get older, those symptoms may be confused with other things—the way it was shared with me yesterday.", "I think what I realized yesterday is that my dad was right: You need to be proactive about your health. Taking this test didn’t last more than five minutes. The people who facilitate the test care so much. They make you at ease, and make it easy for you to be proactive. That’s a message that’s really important here as well, as we think about the type of action plan and framework that goes around the support that this bill requires.", "I’d be remiss, as you all may know, not to touch a little bit more on COPD. As I mentioned earlier, the one thing I learned from my dad is that you have to be proactive about your health. A couple of years ago, the last photo I had with Dad—darn it, I thought I was going to make it through—was a Breathers United t-shirt. We were holding it up, and we were saluting everyone who was working so hard to make sure that people understand what it’s like to have difficulty breathing. COPD is a nasty, nasty disease, but Dad surpassed his life expectancy by seven years because he chose to be proactive. He learned to live with COPD for 12 years, and that’s, again, because he was proactive. He sought out support groups that were proactive.", "His legacy is extended today through the actions that we’re taking in supporting Bill 41.

I didn’t know this until recently, but over 5,000 hospital emergency department visits related to COPD each year take place through the LHIN, which is really quite incredible when you think about it.", "Preventive measures are of the utmost importance, and this piece of legislation will give more resources to health care workers in their fight against lung diseases. It will also give important focus and attention to some of society’s most pernicious and prevalent conditions: asthma; lung cancer; emphysema; as the member opposite mentioned, IPF; and COPD, just to name a few.", "The good news is that smoking is on the decline. In my own riding, the smoking rate is 17.4%, just below the provincial rate of 17.8%, but that number is still too high, and I believe that we can do more to lower this number. The Lung Health Act is another tool that we can use in this battle.", "Just three to nine months after quitting smoking, lung function can increase by as much as 30%, and symptoms, such as shortness of breath and coughing, can disappear. After 10 years, the risk of lung cancer is reduced by 50%. So educating the public on all of the risk factors that contribute to lung health decline, including smoking, can go a long way in ensuring that Ontarians have healthy lungs today and in the future.", "COPD is just one of the significant lung diseases, as we mentioned earlier, facing our society. Lung cancer, IPF, emphysema and asthma, among others, are serious problems in our community. They can devastate families, as has already been noted, and can cost our society billions of dollars.", "On a personal note, I lost my father to lung cancer as well. Twenty years ago, Dad passed away, far too young, at the age of 72. We watched him die, and it was devastating. We could have prevented that, and I’m hoping that through initiatives like this legislation we can do that so that other families won’t have to lose loved ones far too young.", "At the age of four, I developed asthma and have coped with it my entire life. I became seriously ill with pneumonia and I was in and out of hospitals as a young person. It has gotten better with age, but I still cope with asthma. So I understand too what pulmonary function is all about and how, as a woman, it can be extremely devastating.", "To tackle the diverse obstacles to achieving optimal lung health for all Ontarians, we must co-operate and share best practices. The Lung Health Advisory Council proposed in the legislation would do that.", "Mr. Speaker, Boehringer Ingelheim, a research-based pharmaceutical company located in my riding of Burlington, is a shining example of the types of partnerships that can lead to improvements in the lives of Ontarians. Boehringer Ingelheim recently partnered with the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement in an effort to bring better care and outcomes to COPD patients through a program they call INSPIRED, Implementing a Novel and Supportive Program of Individualized care for patients and families living with REspiratory Disease.", "Of the 19 sites in Canada, seven INSPIRED sites are in Ontario, and I’m happy to say that there’s one at Joseph Brant Hospital in my riding, and it’s working very well. A collaboration such as this is critical to the future sustainability of not only our health care system but all of Canada. Creating the Lung Health Advisory Council would only enhance the ability of organizations and programs like these to ensure that Ontarians get the most information about how to keep their lungs healthy and get easy and efficient access to health care programs when they need them most.", "Monsieur le Président, ensemble nous pouvons créer un environnement plus sain pour les poumons de l’Ontario. Le Conseil consultatif de la maladie pulmonaire est un outil qui promouvrait la recherche, la sensibilisation et le traitement dans nos communautés. Avec la collaboration de l’Association pulmonaire, du ministère de la Santé et des Soins de longue durée et de plusieurs autres, nous pouvons améliorer la santé de notre province.", "In closing, ultimately it’s our responsibility as legislators to keep Ontarians as safe and healthy as possible now and in the future, and this bill will do just that. I would like to salute my colleague the member for Cambridge for her important work in this regard and for her efforts to make Ontario a healthier place with the Lung Health Act, 2014." ],

I, like many of my colleagues, have read different petitions into the register here and talked about lung health and gone to the various events that the lung association has held here at Queen’s Park. I was very pleased when Chris was in my riding earlier this year during the election campaign to sign the lung health action plan, and I felt great at that time. I was out running the roads in my shorts and sneakers and knocking on doors, and I felt fantastic.", "How quickly that can change. I don’t know if you noticed, but for the first couple of weeks that the Legislature was sitting after Thanksgiving, I wasn’t here. The big reason for that was, leading into the Thanksgiving holiday, a pulmonary embolism made its way from behind my knee into my lung and was pressing up against my heart. There have been a lot of tears here today as people have told their personal stories, but I can tell you, as the father of two young girls who are 13 and 11, there were a few tears shed when that happened as well. It’s a very life-threatening thing. It certainly puts a lot of things into perspective when something like that happens.", "I’m so glad that I’m able to be here today. My daughters don’t have to cry and tell the story about their dad. But, obviously, it has put a new perspective on how important our lungs are—I’ll throw the heart in there, too. It’s pretty important to operating on a daily basis.", "Breathers United has a new meaning for me. “When you can’t breathe, nothing else matters,” has a brand new meaning for me. That’s for sure.

I so appreciate your personal stories, the personal touches. I think it is evident in the House today that lung health affects each and every one of us.", "Today, I come full circle to the reasons I first ran to be a member of this assembly.

It motivated me to bring this bill forward, and I do hear support throughout the House. I thank all the members in the House for their support a little later.", "This bill, as we know, addresses the need for the Lung Health Advisory Council, to make the recommendations regarding lung health issues, and it would focus on research, prevention and treatment of lung disease.

Again, public health will scramble to respond, as do treatment systems, but in many cases with less than satisfactory success. We must have programs in place designed to not only accommodate some of the diseases I mentioned but any new threats. There probably will be something on the horizon, perhaps Marburg virus. We don’t know.", "Now, there presently is no legislation directing the Ministry of Health to call together any kind of comprehensive plan or program, so this proposed law would essentially set in place a decision-making tree or structure and set in place policies so that we can hit the ground running.", "I’ve often felt that our province’s health care system really doesn’t adequately reflect the need for prevention to the extent that it should vis-à-vis treatment. In my view, it’s a system designed to treat illness, not so much to prevent it. It’s basically oriented towards physicians, towards hospitals that are in the business of treatment, by and large. I’m not a physician; I worked in the health care field for 20 years. I’m not a research scientist, but I did work for a provincial research agency for 20 years.", "Many physicians in Ontario, unlike our present Minister of Health, are not trained in tropical medicine, or aren’t necessarily trained in public health, for that matter. This hit home to me many years ago. I returned from a six-month stint in South America. I was working in shipyards. I owned a boat down there. I was up to my neck in the Paramaribo River and the Amazon, and I brought home a number of tropical skin diseases. Fortunately, my physician in Port Dover, Dr. Thompson, was from Jamaica and had training in tropical diseases, and he explained to me that there wouldn’t be another doctor in the area who would know what to do with what I brought back from South America.", "Given my previous background, I am bound—I feel bound—to take a neutral, objective, evidence-based, science-based, research-based approach to crafting this legislation. I’m calling for a provincial framework. I’m calling for an action plan through our Ministry of Health, a plan that, first and foremost, encompasses surveillance, education materials and guidelines—guidelines for prevention, identification, diagnosis, treatment and management, including emergency preparedness—and calls for the sharing of best practices provincially and across our country. It would instruct the Minister of Health to bring in legislation to bolster research collaboration among all concerned, particularly those in the public.", "I would ask for referral to a standing committee for hearings, and I also know there is a call for a select committee. There are different ways we could go, of course. It indicates that a website should be set up within a year.", "So again, one of my goals really is to facilitate an efficient, more effective allocation, essentially, of what I consider scarce health resources. Going back to prevention, it’s much more cost-effective to prevent than to treat. We know that the worldwide cost of SARS, for example, was $40 billion, and the bill in Canada came in at $2 billion, so prevention is key. Prevention is certainly key when there is no vaccine or no effective treatment. Obviously, when you’re dealing with a particular affliction like that, prevention is the only option.", "As far as definitions in general in the legislation—when we talk about vector-borne or zoonotic diseases or infectious diseases, their transmission involves an animal host. In some cases, it involves a vector. It may be a mosquito, with respect to West Nile; it may be a tick, with respect to Lyme.", "Over the past two millennia, there certainly have been periods in history where disease outbreaks have wreaked havoc in human populations. Advances in medicine have tamed much of this, but complete eradication is still at bay for so many diseases.", "Those dealing death, like the present concern with Ebola, get most of the attention, but other newly arrived diseases like West Nile—there was quite a ruckus about West Nile, certainly in my area down on Long Point on Lake Erie, seven years ago—or Lyme disease are devastating for those who may have picked them up.", "Changing environments: Diseases are changing, and those in charge need to change and accommodate, as do the rest of us. My concern is that these newly arrived diseases, the unknowns, compete for attention. They compete for scarce resources. To partly accommodate that, I call for a framework to set priorities with respect to allocation of resources.", "I mentioned surveillance. Going back to surveillance, we need a program that must be designed to properly track incidence rates and to track associated economic costs. Timely and accurate information is crucial to detect, to monitor. As I said, it’s more effective to prevent rather than to treat. We know that from SARS. Part of that was blamed, as I understand it, on lax prevention and hygiene.", "A few decades ago, so many of these diseases I’ve mentioned were not a concern in Ontario. That has changed. There has been what I consider a clear and immediate threat. Again, the importance of education: We just can’t get all our information from CNN or from websites.", "In my area—and I do try and put out the word—if you’re involved in farming, fishing, hunting or biking, or spending a lot of time outdoors or working outdoors—I think of our MNR staff, for example—you have to keep an eye out for the symptoms.", "This summer I met with three people in my constituency office. They all reported that they felt they had Lyme. They felt, like others in their situation, that the health care system wasn’t there for them. In this case, they reported they were paying out of their own pocket. They received a diagnosis in the United States, and I just think that’s unfortunate.", "The stories are different. These three are in the prime of their lives. They saw a debilitating change when they caught the diseases and were diagnosed. They were concerned. They felt that some of the MRIs were unnecessary, and the other procedures. They advocated the long-term antibiotic treatment. I feel the jury is out on that one.", "I’m not taking sides on any of those issues, by the way. That’s up to government. We have government for a reason. That’s up to the framework, the action plan, the process that I’m proposing to make those kinds of decisions and to continue to make those kinds of decisions.", "Lyme disease: It’s the blacklegged tick. I don’t have time to get into a lot of detail. It’s a hot spot down in my area: the north shore of Lake Erie, the north shore of Lake Ontario, and along the St. Lawrence. Both Long Point and Turkey Point were very early hot spots. The signs are up there, but I don’t see people—we have hundreds of thousands of people come to our provincial parks in the summer and I don’t see them with long pants and socks, rolled into boots, to protect themselves from ticks.", "West Nile is mosquito-borne, as we know. Mosquitoes like long grass and standing water. Most people infected develop no symptoms; about 20% will develop what is known as West Nile fever. I don’t have time to go into the symptoms, but again, as with other zoonotics, in this case an animal host was first detected in Africa in the 1930s, and was detected in Ontario in birds. At the time, I spent one weekend driving around with a dead crow in my trunk, waiting for Monday morning to take it into the health unit to be tested.", "I’ve mentioned West Nile and Lyme. Other vector-borne would include equine encephalitis virus, malaria, yellow fever—travel-related, not endemic transmission within our province of Ontario.", "We hear so much about Lyme. Including probable cases, our public health system identified 185 cases in Ontario. There are more cases of malaria in Ontario, actually—220. West Nile comes in at 239.", "I feel there’s much work to be done; hence my proposal with respect to a comprehensive framework and an action plan to address new and emerging diseases." ],

Lyme disease has been considered reportable in Ontario since 1991, but unfortunately our response continues to be insufficient and unacceptable.", "Too often, we hear stories of residents of this province—a province with a universal health care system—forced to cross the border into Buffalo or Detroit and pay for medical services that are not being provided for them here. I understand that Lyme disease is a topic that even medical professionals continue to debate, in terms of what the best forms of treatment and responses are. The fact that our constituents are forced to travel outside the country for care is proof that we can do better.", "If you would indulge me for a few minutes, Speaker, I would like to discuss a couple of stories specific to my riding of Hamilton East–Stoney Creek. As I’ve said, it is a concern that we have heard many times, and I believe it will help to illustrate the need for greater response in our province.", "A lady by the name of Anita Kos is a constituent of mine. Anita struggled with Lyme disease for almost a decade before she finally was diagnosed in the United States in 2013. I’ll read a quote from Anita: “If it had been caught early here, it wouldn’t have got to the stage it’s at now, where it robs me of any quality of life and independence. It wreaks havoc on every system of my body and it’s very unpredictable, so I don’t know hour to hour how I’m going to feel. It’s a horrible way to live.”", "According to the Canadian Lyme Disease Foundation, there are three stages of this disease: early infection; spreading of the infection; and chronic Lyme. As time is allowed to pass, both the diagnosis and the treatment become increasingly more difficult. Symptoms worsen, and there’s not a single system in the human body that this disease does not affect.", "In the early 1990s, there was only one known endemic area in Ontario: at Long Point Provincial Park. Since then, Ontario has seen an increase in the distribution of ticks, especially in eastern Ontario. And this is the important part: Public Health Ontario acknowledges that this has resulted in “an increase in locally acquired human cases of Lyme disease.” Public Health Ontario has also stated that “the incidence rate of Lyme in Ontario has been steadily increasing since 2002.” Yet we continue to stand back and allow this to occur.", "Anita doesn’t know where she contracted Lyme disease, but, sadly, she’s glad to know now that she has it as it has allowed her to begin treatment and the path to recovery. But the treatment isn’t cheap—far from it. For Anita to visit the Sponaugle Wellness Institute in Florida, it costs nearly $4,000 a week.", "Speaker, every time I hear stories of the exorbitant, outrageous costs of health care south of the border, I have a renewed appreciation for our system of universal health care as provided to us by the great New Democrat and our greatest Canadian, Tommy Douglas. I can assure you that fellow citizens being forced across the border to pay for health care is not the system that Mr. Douglas had in mind when he created it.", "I attended a fundraiser last year that members of our community held for Anita and her family to help them cover the cost of her ongoing care. While I was humbled and amazed by the generosity of the organizers and attendees, the fact that an individual Ontarian could be forced to fundraise for medical costs was the true take-away from this event. The fact is, we need to do more.", "Anita is not the only constituent of mine who is suffering from this disease. The Thiessen family, friends of mine who were stationed in Russia, doing work over there—consisting of parents Douglas and Julie, and their sons, Josh and Zac—are a wonderful family I have gotten to know in Stoney Creek through the incredible artwork that Josh does. He is now a renowned artist who is gaining fame in Canada. He studied under Bateman. He’s a naturalist, with his paintings. This young gentleman is in his 20s, and some of his paintings are already selling for over $20,000. They’re a wonderful family, but I was shocked to learn last year that all four members of their family have been diagnosed and are suffering from Lyme disease. Though the family remain in good spirits and continue to have a significant positive impact on our community every day, they are still experiencing a lot of the same hardships that Anita faces, especially the father.", "Speaker, the list goes on and on.", "The bill we are debating today is not going to be an instant solution for the problem, but it is a good step in the right direction. I pray that our researchers and our physicians can come up with a solution. This is a complex medical issue, and though I don’t have a medical doctorate like our Minister of Health or the fine doctor across from me, I do have the common sense to see that we need to make changes and address this growing concern.", "The bill will require the Minister of Health to develop a provincial framework and action plan that establishes a provincial surveillance program, standardized educational materials and guidelines regarding the prevention, identification, treatment and management of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases.", "There are a lot of significant asks here, and they are something that I expect all members of this House should and will be able to support.", "I’ve spent the majority of my time discussing Lyme disease, as it is an issue which I have encountered most frequently from my constituents visiting my office, but the same principles apply for all vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. The fact is, we need to take the necessary steps to address this issue head-on and support all Ontarians, our physicians and our researchers, and all the people who are suffering from or at risk of contracting one of these diseases.

Ontario has a robust strategy in place for the surveillance, prevention and control of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, including the promotion of public awareness of these diseases and emergency preparedness. An effective framework for the surveillance, prevention and control of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases already exists under two different pieces of public health legislation: on the one hand, the Health Protection and Promotion Act, and the other being the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion Act, including the Ontario Public Health Standards.", "The HPPA sets out the legal reporting requirements for a list of infectious diseases, including zoonotic, which are diseases that involve transmission from an animal to a human, and also vector-borne, which are those that require an intermediary, if you will, often a mosquito, for the transmission from one human to another human. Of course, many of these diseases are of concern in Ontario. Among them, of course, we know SARS, West Nile virus, Lyme disease and Ebola virus disease.", "Public Health Ontario collects and analyzes this data that we receive in order to track incidence rates and to identify any trends requiring public health action in order to mitigate any outbreaks or prevent the spread of the disease. The Infectious Diseases Protocol that this government has under the Ontario Public Health Standards sets out the specific guidelines for the prevention and the identification and management of reportable diseases.", "At the provincial level, educational materials on zoonotic and vector-borne diseases for members of the public and health care providers are created and distributed by my ministry, and of course shared with the local public health units. The Public Health Agency of Canada also shares consistent public messaging and resources for vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus and Lyme disease.", "Speaker, members may be interested to know that Ontario is currently one of only two provinces and territories to have a public health veterinarian within its Ministry of Health with sole responsibility for the zoonotic and vector-borne disease portfolios. Ontario’s track record with respect to zoonotic and vector-borne diseases demonstrates just how effective our existing framework for prevention and control is, including, for example, the successful management and prevention of rabies since the 1990s and West Nile virus since 2002.", "It’s also important to note that while Ebola virus disease continues to be an ongoing concern in West Africa, there has never been a case of Ebola in Canada or in Ontario, and the risk to Canadians remains very, very low. Nevertheless, we have taken precautions to ensure the safety of all Ontarians, especially our health care workers, our first line of defence against Ebola. Specifically, my ministry has worked together with Ontario health care providers and partners to provide them with guidelines regarding Ebola virus disease diagnosis, specimen collection, infection prevention and control, occupational health and safety measures, and laboratory testing.", "Since then, at my request, the interim Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Mowat, has issued directives to all acute-care settings and paramedic and first responder services on the procedures necessary to protect the health of workers and significantly reduce the risk of spreading the disease. In fact, further directives from the interim chief are currently being prepared in consultation with key partners.", "The acute-care directive requires that at all times two registered nurses provide care to each patient confirmed to have Ebola, and they must not care for any other patients. Further, we’re enhancing the province’s Ebola readiness strategies in six key ways.", "First, my ministry has designated 11 referral hospitals across Ontario to serve as referral centres for the treatment of any confirmed Ebola cases.", "Second, my ministry is working with emergency medical services to designate and equip ambulances to transport Ebola patients to designated hospitals for treatment. The first responders on these ambulances would wear impermeable, full-body barrier protection in order to protect themselves.", "Third, the Ontario public health laboratory now has the capability to test any potential Ebola case in this province. This provides Ontario with local capacity that makes test results available sooner; actually, within about four hours of receiving the sample.", "Fourth, my ministry has created a formal health workers minister’s advisory table on Ebola preparedness to ensure that the needs of health care workers are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. It brings together key stakeholders and partners to provide input and advice to inform the ministry’s decisions as we continue to ensure Ontario’s readiness. The first meetings, of course, have already taken place.", "Fifth, my ministry created an Ebola Command Table, which I chair, and which includes the interim Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Deputy Minister of Health, Public Health Ontario, our partner ministries, representatives from the province’s local health integration networks and designated referral hospitals.", "Finally, the province is enhancing the availability of personal protective equipment to protect health care workers who treat Ebola patients. My ministry is maintaining a website with information on the risk posed by Ebola virus disease for members of the public and health care providers.", "In closing, I want to assure all Ontarians that their safety remains my top priority, a priority strongly supported by our province’s framework for prevention and control of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases in Ontario.

I have sort of a good-news story and a bad-news story I would like to share from my riding when it comes to—one is a zoonotic incident and one is a vector-borne incident.", "I guess I’ll share the good-news story first since we were just talking about Ebola and the health minister spoke about some of the protocols that are in place when dealing with a possible Ebola case. As many of you know, being in Prince Edward–Hastings, I represent the city of Belleville. Over the Thanksgiving weekend, it was early on the Thanksgiving Monday morning when a suspected case of Ebola walked into the emergency room at Belleville General Hospital. It was a member from our military who had been delivering health supplies to Sierra Leone. When he arrived back at home at CFB Trenton, he felt very, very ill and immediately came into the Belleville General Hospital. Full credit to the staff that were on early in the morning on Thanksgiving Monday. They had that patient isolated in an observation room within four minutes of his arrival. They did excellent work, and I have to give proper credit to the registered nurse, Chris Wilson, who was on duty. He immediately put on his protective clothing so that he could protect himself and care for the individual. The calls went out, as you would expect that they would go out when this type of a case, or a suspected case, makes its way into your hospital. We’re very fortunate to have a great chief of staff at Quinte Health Care, Dr. Dick Zoutman, who actually is an infectious disease expert in his own right, so he knew exactly what to do. The physicians and the staff handled that situation extremely well.", "Fortunately, after several hours of waiting for the test results—and one of the things that the minister hit on is that we need to get those results quickly, because in this day and age, the way the Twitterverse goes, that poor guy, who came into the hospital to get checked out as a possible case of Ebola, had Ebola, as it was reported on Twitter. Everybody was in a frenzy, not just in the Belleville area but across Ontario and in Canada. We even had international attention because this individual made his way in.", "The entire staff responded very quickly. If I could, I’d just like to give credit to Dr. Michael de la Roche, who is the chief of infection control. As you can imagine—it was Thanksgiving weekend—he was at a cottage an hour away, and immediately came in at 4:30 in the morning. All of the staff at the hospital were on heightened alert.", "Things did seem to go according to plan there. They are making some changes to the way that they deal with things, as the minister has done in his capacity as the Minister of Health here in Ontario. We can always learn from these types of situations.", "Now the bad: I just want to share a quick story about a problem in Prince Edward–Hastings and in other parts of Ontario as well, and that’s Lyme disease and the fact that there don’t seem to be proper protocols in place. I hope it is something that can be dealt with if the member from Haldimand–Norfolk gets his select committee or does manage to get this bill to committee. We need to have protocols that are in place across the province, where those who are working in our emergency rooms, and our family physicians and general practitioners, have the right information to pass along to people. I can tell you that it’s really a patchwork kind of approach to dealing with Lyme disease, depending on where you go.", "We’ve had a real outbreak of ticks in the central Hastings region, where I’m from. As a matter of fact, we just came through deer hunting season. There was a young kid from Tweed who was out hunting. He had seven ticks on him when he arrived back. It’s a serious problem. You have to make sure that they know how to remove the ticks, first of all, and what the symptoms are, to know about Lyme disease and whether or not you could be negatively affected by Lyme disease.", "I can tell you the story of one couple from the Centre Hastings area, and this is not unfamiliar; I believe the member from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek alluded to it as well. Members of the public can’t get the treatment, in our hospitals and from our physicians in Ontario, that they need to deal with this disease. There’s one woman in my riding who has to drive to Plattsburgh, New York—it’s about a four- or five-hour drive from her home—every six months to see a physician there to get the medication that she needs. Every time she goes there, it’s $700 or $800, and that doesn’t even include her medication, which can cost $500 to $600 more. She has dealt with this disease since 2006 but can’t get anyone in this country or in this province to look after her symptoms and her prognosis, which is Lyme disease.", "I know others are going to want to touch on this. I don’t want to take too much of their time. But we really have to start to get this right. I think what the member from Haldimand–Norfolk is proposing in his private member’s bill is a great way to start to get us headed in the right direction when we’re dealing with these zoonotic and also vector-borne illnesses." ],

I’m certainly pleased that the Minister of Health is here to hear this story.", "Just a few weeks ago, I went to a fundraiser in Fort Erie for Amanda Wilson. Frankly, I was shocked at what they were raising funds for. Amanda is a young lady who is a border security officer. The Legion hall was packed; there were 600 or 700 people there. They were raising funds. Her co-workers were there; the other border security officers that weren’t protecting our borders were there; her family was there. I had the privilege to talk to her father, who obviously is very, very concerned.", "She’s a young woman who is talented, smart and hard-working. She had contracted the disease. She was working on the front line at the border, like a lot of folks from Fort Erie, but now she has been out of work for over a year, all because Amanda was bitten by a tick.", "The problem is—this is why I’m so glad that the health minister is listening to this—none of the testing here in Ontario came through that she had Lyme disease. For people like this, they get really sick and they stay sick for a long period of time. Amanda was going through an unbelievably tough time, with her family by her side. People with untreated Lyme disease kept getting worse. As my colleagues in the other party mentioned, the symptoms of Lyme disease look like symptoms of a number of other very bad diseases—MS, Alzheimer’s.", "She went to the United States, and finally she was given a proper diagnosis that said what it was. It was Lyme disease. We have to ask ourselves why. Today, she is receiving treatment in Buffalo, New York, right across the river from her own home. The fundraiser I went to was to raise funds to pay for her medical bills, which are now currently over $100,000. You see, Amanda cannot get proper treatment here in Ontario because we weren’t able to do the testing that said she had Lyme disease. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to a lot of people probably in this room, but that’s what happened.", "She has been incredibly strong during this entire ordeal, and so have her family, her friends and her co-workers. But there are others like her. We shouldn’t have to have fundraisers to help people who are sick receive medical care in the province of Ontario.", "I appreciate the debate on this issue. I want to encourage this House to help the people of Ontario receive the medical care they have a right to.", "I’ll finish up by saying this to the Minister of Health: If you’d like to get more details on this or set up a meeting with the young lady, I would like to do that, but I think the bigger issue is, we’ve got to find out what the issue was here, to make sure it never happens to anybody else again. Thank you very much for standing." ],

Recent studies done in Ontario show that warmer temperatures increase tick reproduction two to five times. I can tell you that since we’re heading to four degrees Celsius, which is a higher base, that is twice the rate of warming that is now understood.", "I have suggested a few times that we should raise this above the level of politics. To my friends in the Conservative Party I would say this: How are you going to pay for this, my dear friend who introduced the bill? If we have a fivefold increase in ticks in the next decade or so, we’re likely going to have a fivefold increase in disease. Do you know how devastating that will be? I’m waiting to hear what the position of the Conservative Party is, if it’s so concerned about Lyme disease. When we know that climate change will increase this by 500%, how do you deal with the devastation on families that you clearly and rightly see is a problem without addressing climate change?", "We’re going to get into politics—as long as you have free carbon dioxide and you don’t have a trading mechanism like all of Europe does. It doesn’t have to be a carbon tax, but there has to be some sort of trading mechanism. How do you fight this when carbon dioxide is emitted for free and there’s no market mechanism that rewards businesses to reduce it?", "I can give you about a half-dozen other diseases that are also going to become epidemic at rates we’ve never seen, costing our health care systems billions of dollars.", "I find these private members’ motions very important, but when you divorce the causal effect and you don’t want to address the epidemics that are going to come with this new climate beyond food shortages and other things, we’re not having a realistic discussion.", "These are real vectors for disease: the rapidly changing environment—because climate is going to impact a two-degree change in the United States. The mean temperature change in Ontario will be one of the highest in the world at five degrees, and we become the next new belt, because, as you know, these insects and these mites have heat—thermal—detectors. That’s how they move.", "Mr. Speaker, I will close. I will leave some time for my friend.

She’s just a phenomenal lady who has suffered with Lyme disease for years upon years.", "Just last week, during our constit week I had the opportunity to hear the story from a gentleman by the name of Lyn, who was the first person in Huron county to be diagnosed with Lyme disease.", "Before I get into those stories, I also congratulate the member from Haldimand–Norfolk for recognizing the importance of looking at the big picture. So much is at stake. I think about the genuine concern about Ebola. There’s a program associated with the agri-food sector called the Advanced Agricultural Leadership Program. For the first time ever in decades, this particular organization was going to send their current class to Africa, but unfortunately that trip was cancelled because of the fear and concern over Ebola, and, most importantly, how it’s diagnosed and treated.

I think I, in my family, must have the sweetest blood, because I am the magnet for mosquitoes. I can’t help but express concern every day that we’re out and about.", "When it comes back to Lyme, I think about the people who ask for permission to go hunting at the back of our farm in the bush when deer season rolls along. I think about the people who have met with me in my constituency office, expressing concern. I also think about the people who have done so much and incurred so much.", "Just this past week, on Tuesday, the member from Haldimand–Norfolk held a media conference. He had a brave individual sit beside him to share his story. I was chatting with Will’s wife. Knowing how this has rolled out, I said, “How much have you had to spend to try to maintain a certain level of health for your husband?” Speaker, they had gone into debt $40,000. It’s not right, it needs to stop, and we need to start identifying opportunities to help these people instead of driving them to the States and driving them to Europe for treatment.", "I also want to recognize that this is not new. Finally, we’re doing something about it today. In 2013, Better Farming, a publication that’s known widely through rural Ontario, celebrated something. One of their journalists, Mary Baxter, wrote an article called “Lyme Disease: The Painful and Hard-to-Diagnose Condition.” It was nominated and won best agricultural story in the world. I just want to recognize that the award was announced in Sweden, where judges called Baxter’s piece “beautiful” and said it used “a nice mix of human-interest storytelling and scientific research, exemplifying great journalism.” That was back in 2011, but I can tell you—and if I could get a page to bring me another glass of water, I’d appreciate it—people have suffered for so much longer.", "A brief snippet out of Lyn’s diary: “Feeling better, but will more than likely be on a long road back to normal. Starting to feel someone is sitting on my chest. I guess doctors will figure this out, hopefully.” Then, sadly, he continues to write in his diary: “Had to retire earlier than I had wanted to.” It’s just not right.", "Then there’s Deborah, who has quite a story. She contracted Lyme herself, but found she had passed it on to her three sons. When I first met her a couple of years ago, her children were ages five, seven and eight, and our eyes just welled and our hearts broke when she spoke about her oldest child, Caleb, who had been struggling with his health since the age of three. He had had countless tests. In the end, he ended up having to see a psychiatrist. That’s where, ultimately, he was put on anti-psychotic drugs because they were desperate. His brain was in a fog. He was unable to learn even basic academics. He had regressed to a point of no longer being able to read and write. Deborah met with the school board and they made a painful decision to send him 45 minutes, one bus ride, each way, to a different classroom, where he could get the emotional and behavioural support that he needed.", "Doris, a champion who pulls everyone together in support, has suffered long with Lyme disease. It broke my heart last week when she shared with me that there were times she would just want to die, because people don’t understand how Lyme disease affects an individual. That’s when Deborah said even her own son, now at the age of 11, would rather die than continue living this, because they felt there was no hope.", "But now, due to the member from Haldimand–Norfolk and the support of the House today, we do have some hope." ],

I recognize, of course, the remarks of the Minister of Health, who reinforced and affirmed the provincial existing framework and all the various programs and our liaison with public health units across the province and designated hospitals for high-end illnesses, be it SARS or be it Ebola. For example, Etobicoke General Hospital in Etobicoke North was one of the sites and centres for SARS control.

It’s got a sort of strangely named bacterium, by the way, Borrelia burgdorferi, and I’ll probably have to give that exact spelling to Hansard later.", "Of course, one of the confusions, and perhaps I might use this opportunity, is that the symptoms can be very, very non-specific. You’re looking at stiff neck, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, fatigue, muscle aches, joint pain and, of course, this sort of specialized migrating bull’s-eye kind of skin rash. So it can be very confusing. It’s not common that patients will present with all of these. They’ll have their own menu choice of them, and that’s unfortunately one of the reasons why perhaps diagnosis is not done quite as early as it might be.

Ontarians assume that democratically elected municipal councils make the rules and decisions on local planning matters. However, that belief is routinely proven wrong by the Ontario Municipal Board.", "Last year this government conducted a consultation exercise on Planning Act reforms. I was chair of the city of Toronto’s planning growth management committee. I led the city’s process to develop a response to that consultation. There was stakeholder consultation; we listened to various stakeholders. Toronto city council unanimously endorsed a series of positions upon which this bill has been constructed.", "I also want to note that city of Toronto planning staff consulted with many of their peers in Ontario, their planning peers, in the formulation of positions to find those that had some common ground with other municipalities. I want to thank Jennifer Keesmaat and Kerri Voumvakis, the senior staff at the city, for their thoughtful assistance in this.", "This bill contains amendments to existing legislation that will address three broad themes. It aims to restore more local decision-making on planning matters back to local government while balancing the need to continue to maintain an accessible mechanism for appealing poor decisions to the Ontario Municipal Board. It will modernize certain aspects of the Planning Act, and it also seeks to grant municipalities increased powers to address the pressing demands created by growth and development. There are some specific amendments to the City of Toronto Act.", "In terms of restoring local decision-making, this act will prohibit appeals to the OMB of official plan amendments that are made by a municipality to conform with changes to provincial policy or provincial growth plans. It will also require the Minister of Municipal Affairs to endeavour to align changes between provincial policy statements and provincial growth plans and provide direction on their interpretation.", "Municipally initiated official plan amendments, once they come into force, would also no longer be subject to appeal to the OMB for a period of five years.", "Zoning bylaws that implement municipally initiated official plan amendments would no longer be subject to appeal for a period of five years from when they came into force, and site-specific zoning bylaws would no longer be subject to appeal for a period of five years from when they came into force.", "Municipalities will also be able to pass bylaws which would restrict the making of applications to the committee of adjustment with respect to a site-specific bylaw for three years from the passage of that bylaw unless the variance being sought is truly technical or housekeeping in nature.", "This bill proposes to require the OMB to make decisions that are consistent with those of the municipality and restrict the ability to introduce new evidence to the OMB that was not used or available to the local council when they were making their decision. Appellants would have to clearly explain their reasons for an appeal and list the evidence they propose to make their application upon. Also, the timing for filing appeals would be lengthened in a number of instances—official plan amendments from 180 days to 240, concurrent zoning bylaw amendments to an OPA from 180 to 240 days, and a zoning bylaw amendment from 120 days to 180 days. These changes will allow municipalities more time to review proposals without the threat of a pre-emptive appeal to the OMB.", "All of these measures are meant to ensure that local municipalities have the final word on many planning matters, that the OMB’s scope to overturn municipal decisions is circumscribed and that general appeals against an entire official plan will be curtailed as having insufficient supporting evidence to proceed. These measures will restore the public’s confidence in the planning system, restore accountability to elected officials and potentially save municipalities significant resources that are expended on preparing for and defending against numerous appeals.", "I also want to be clear that none of these measures will abolish the OMB and the ability for property owners to appeal applications or decisions. However, it will limit the ability to frustrate local municipalities’ ability to approve and enforce properly formulated plans or bylaws.", "This bill will also modernize the planning process. Electronic notices will now be allowed and deemed to be valid notice.", "People all over this province cannot understand what a minor variance is. The four tests established to assess what a minor variance is are too vague, and this bill would require the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing to enact regulations to define concepts for the determination of whether a variance being sought is minor or not and what the meaning of the term “desirable for the appropriate development or use of land” means.", "Municipalities now throughout the province of Ontario have the right to establish local appeal bodies for committee of adjustment matters, but they do not have the right to revert back to the OMB if they so choose. This bill would give municipalities that right to make a choice and be able to change their minds in the future. It will also give municipalities the right to set appropriate fees to cover the costs of the committee of adjustment and local appeal body without the right of people to appeal against those fees.", "Finally, the third theme of these amendments is about giving municipalities more tools to manage the impacts of growth and development. This bill will grant municipalities the right to promote built form that is well-designed, encourages a sense of place and provides for public spaces that are of high quality, safe, accessible, attractive and vibrant. It may seem obvious that municipalities would expect excellence in design; however, they have had too few tools to mandate it from developers.", "This bill will grant municipalities the power to try to address the shortage of affordable housing in the province by allowing municipalities the power to implement inclusionary zoning bylaws that would mandate the provision of affordable housing in new developments that contain 20 or more new housing units.", "This bill will allow municipalities to pass bylaws implementing a formula-based mechanism to secure community benefits in exchange for increases in height or density under section 37 of the Planning Act, thereby creating a more transparent and predictable process for both developers and communities impacted by development.", "The amendments proposed that are specific to the city of Toronto are the ability of the city to be able to enforce conditions related to the development onto the title of a property. So when a property changes hands from one developer to another, the new property owner, the new developer, wouldn’t be able to try and renegotiate everything.", "This would also, specifically to the City of Toronto Act, prohibit the ability to appeal the fees that would be set for the city of Toronto’s local appeal body. It would also instill within the legislation that the local appeal body, within its rules of procedure, would have to mandate mediation and related procedures.", "Also related to the city of Toronto, which has a very specific official plan, it would amend the Building Code Act to require the chief building official of the city to apply the rental housing conversion and demolition policies of the official plan as applicable law against the granting of demolition or building permits for the conversion of residential rental properties. What that means is that in the city of Toronto, where we have several hundred thousand units of rental housing, we have very strong policies protecting against the conversion of those properties. However, the chief building official, under the Building Code Act, might still be compelled to issue a building permit or a demolition permit for those. That is a loophole that causes angst to hundreds of thousands of tenants within the city of Toronto.", "Also related to the city of Toronto, this bill proposes to prevent appeals of interim control bylaws to allow planners and communities the time to carefully study the future growth in a neighbourhood.", "This bill, if adopted, will restore more local decision-making on planning matters to Ontarians. It will increase transparency and accountability in the planning review process, and it will allow for better alignment between provincial policy statements, growth plans and local official plans. It will give cities, towns and villages across the province of Ontario more of a say—a final say—in how their communities will grow and evolve.", "Mr. Speaker, I have 25 years of experience in planning matters, not just as a city councillor but as practitioner, designing, consulting and assisting the development industry in moving forward, so I know both sides of these issues.", "These amendments are ones that the city of Toronto, in consultation with stakeholders within the city of Toronto and in consultation with professional planners in other municipalities in this province—these were positions that were brought forward to the government as part of the consultation process around planning reform. These reforms would allow development to continue apace. They would ensure, however, that those who are elected in their local councils, when they stand up, pass a bylaw and tell their residents that the process that they participated in to establish a bylaw or an official plan or a secondary plan—that it has some meaning, that zoning bylaws don’t simply become zoning guidelines and official plans don’t simply become something that can be amended on a daily basis.", "I trust that members of this Legislature listened carefully, and I look forward to their comments. I hope I can count on all of their support." ],

I want to commend him for that.", "However, I have some real problems with the bill. Most of it relates to the consultation. We heard in the presentation that the consultation was with the municipalities and with the planners who work for municipalities, but I didn’t hear of the consultation that’s required between the people of the cities and towns in Ontario, the other side of the equation.", "This bill was introduced Tuesday afternoon, 48 hours ago. In my experience in this province over the last 30 years, consultation in planning matters is measured in months and years—the consultation to put in new legislation—not 48 hours.", "It makes over 20 changes to two pieces of legislation and two regulations, one of which is under a separate piece of legislation. Some of these changes, as the member described, would have a significant impact on planning and land use in Ontario. In fact, I’ve seen many government bills that have made far less significant changes, which is very concerning to me.", "The nature of a private member’s bill is that it has less debate and often less public scrutiny than a government bill. Today, we have 12 minutes per caucus to present our concerns on second reading of a bill that impacts every riding in the province of Ontario—only 12 minutes to lay out what amendments are needed if this bill were to proceed to committee.", "I know that the MPP from Etobicoke–Lakeshore has a municipal background, and I hope this bill is the result of his personal experience and thoughts. I hope that it isn’t, as some people have suggested, an attempt by the government to sneak through significant legislation on a Thursday afternoon.", "I don’t have time to list all our concerns with this bill, but I do want to go through a few of the items that I have concerns about, particularly those that reduce consultation and take away the right for members of the public to appeal.", "Mr. Speaker, this bill contains an amendment to section 2 of the Planning Act. As members may recall, this section of the act sets out the areas of provincial interest that municipal councils must have regard to when carrying out their responsibilities. This covers important areas such as the protection of ecological systems, protection of agricultural resources and accessibility for persons with disabilities. These are core values that we all share. They’re fundamentals.", "This section also includes a commitment to the minimization of waste. To the many people in my riding who are fighting a landfill site proposal to ensure our drinking water is kept safe, that is a key value and very important.", "Mr. Speaker, this bill amends section 2 to add promotion of built form that is well-designed and “encourages a sense of place.” I’m not sure that most of us could even significantly define “sense of place.”", "I agree with the goal of having attractive buildings, but I don’t believe that it is equivalent to those other values. I don’t believe that it belongs at the same level as other provincial interests—the core values—outlined in the section. Each of these items becomes a responsibility and a burden to municipal councils. When it is a key value that we all share, I think that councils are happy to take on that burden, but adding less important items to the list results in it becoming over-regulation and red tape for our municipalities.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m also concerned that this bill reduces the ability of people and organizations to appeal decisions and actions in numerous ways. First, it removes the ability of people to appeal fees charged by appeal boards, which means that these fees can be raised to discourage appeals.", "This bill also makes changes to the Municipal Board such that appeals must be consistent with original decisions. That means there’s really no longer a real appeal, whether it is for community groups facing a development on environmentally sensitive areas or a company trying to build a factory that has been blocked by not-in-my-backyard syndrome. There would be no opportunity to change a decision and no opportunity to correct an error if one has been made.", "The bill also changes the rules to address how new information is presented at appeal hearings that would have a material impact on the decision. If the municipality submits recommendations within the proper time frame, the appeal board has to make a decision consistent with recommendations. Again, this eliminates the ability of having a real appeal.", "The bill also lengthens the time before appeals can be launched. If someone has applied to a municipality for a zoning change or an official plan amendment and the municipality doesn’t deal with it currently, the applicant has the right to appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board after 180 days of no decision. That’s about six months. This bill lengthens the time to 240 days before an appeal can be launched and the applicant can get a decision. Again, that will not speed up development.", "The bill also removes the right of people in Toronto to appeal an interim bylaw, and it would block landowners from applying to the committee of adjustment for a variance for three years following the passage of a site-specific bylaw.", "Taken together, all these changes will result in a significant reduction in the ability for people to appeal decisions. That certainly doesn’t make the system more fair, and it doesn’t make the system better.", "In September, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing was directed in his mandate letter to lead “a review of the scope and effectiveness of the Ontario Municipal Board,” but before the minister has had an opportunity to do that review, with little or no consultation, the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore is making dramatic changes to the Ontario Municipal Board and burying them in what appears to be an omnibus bill presented here in private members’ business. We agree with the need to review the Ontario Municipal Board—and I want to commend him for bringing that forward—and make changes that ensure that it works better and is more transparent. We’re also looking forward to the consultations and to hearing from all the parties that would be impacted, not a select few of the parties. We cannot support legislation that would make significant changes to the powers of the OMB before that consultation occurs. Frankly, I don’t expect the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing—I think he would have trouble supporting this bill, too. We’ll see that after the end of the debate.", "This bill would also limit public input on provincial policy statements by amending the section that sets a requirement for the minister to consult on these statements, adding a requirement that the minister must “seek to obtain the timely approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.” In other words, “Don’t consult too much; get the approval done so we don’t have to wait.” That would actually force the minister to limit and rush his consultation. This is rather ironic coming from a member of the government that is always talking about conversations and open government.", "I hope that this government, rather than supporting this omnibus bill, which was introduced too late to give members and stakeholders sufficient time, will instead focus on the consultation. The changes in this bill will impact people across Ontario, such as community groups like the Oxford People Against the Landfill in my riding, who want to ensure that they can appeal any decision that would allow a landfill in our community. It would also impact people who are building homes for families across Ontario, the home builders of Ontario. It will impact companies who are trying to build factories and create jobs. It will impact environmental groups who are fighting to protect sensitive land. It will impact municipal councillors who are working to try to do smart land use planning for their community and trying to comply with the Planning Act. But unfortunately, very few of those people were even aware that this bill is being debated today. Even fewer have had an opportunity to read it or the time to research the impact of the changes.", "We have a number of very important reviews due or promised over the next five years: the Municipal Elections Act, the Ontario building code, the greenbelt, Oak Ridges moraine, Niagara Escarpment, the growth plan, the Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy and many others. I hope that these will include real consultations, that the minister will really listen to those people involved and that he won’t introduce or support legislation that makes changes in those areas before taking the time to hear from those people who will be impacted by those changes.", "Again, I want to thank the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore for putting the bill forward, which gives us the opportunity to talk about important land use planning issues. I’m not finding fault with the need to make changes; I’m just finding fault with the process we’re using. While we have concerns about many of the items in this bill, there are some positives, and I hope the member would consider a bill that focuses on those items, a bill that can be properly debated in private members’ business, given the right scrutiny, be put through and be the first private member’s bill passed into legislation. I just don’t believe this is the bill that can do it." ],

They supported it when Ms. DiNovo brought to it the House the last time. If it’s such an important issue—and I believe that it is—then the government should be bringing it forward as a government bill, and the member could then be bringing forward some other important bill.", "We all know what inclusionary zoning is. I’ve heard about it a lot over the last three or four years. It’s a tool that can be used by municipalities. It’s not mandatory. All it does is give municipalities that want to create affordable housing in their jurisdictions the ability to do so. There have been many municipalities across the U.S. and Europe that have done this very successfully over the years. There are numerous municipalities across Ontario, there are numerous city councillors and regional councillors, and there are numerous jurisdictions across Ontario that have all supported inclusionary zoning.", "A number of agencies like the Canadian housing federation and other housing advocates across this province have all supported it as well. But unfortunately, we’ve been waiting six years to get it approved. Maybe it will get approved this time, now that we have a sitting member bringing it forward, but I won’t hold my breath.", "So how can we bring inclusionary zoning to Ontario? Well, I heard the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore. He makes some good points in this bill, but I got up and spoke to the ministerial statement just a couple of hours ago on National Housing Day. We have hundreds of thousands of people in this province—165,000 people, I believe—waiting for affordable housing. That’s households, not people. So it could be as high as 400,000 or 500,000 people in the province waiting for affordable housing. This is one of the tools that would give municipalities the ability to go out and require some assistance from developers.", "Here in the city of Toronto, very few rental units get built across the city. I think it’s as low as 1,200 or 1,400 units a year, when in fact we need 10,000 units a year just to keep up. The population in Toronto is increasing by 100,000 people a year, and all of those people need affordable housing. So I think that the government needs to move forward with this inclusionary zoning proposal.", "There are other ways to assist people who are in need. We need to get rid of vacancy decontrol. For those of you who don’t know, that means that when somebody moves out of an apartment that is rent-controlled at $800 a month, the landlord can increase that rent to $1,500 a month if they want. That’s kind of the second-worst thing for affordable housing in this province.", "We also need to get rid of the rent control piece that exempts buildings built after 1991 and make sure that every rental unit in this province actually has rent controls applied.", "As I said, there has been lots of support for this issue, and I really think that it’s time that we move forward. I know that the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore has some other issues in his bill that I’m not going to address today. I’m sure that if this bill ever sees the light of day and gets to a committee level, we’ll have lots of time to hear from those who are opposed and those who are for and hopefully make the amendments work for all." ],

It is, indeed, a privilege to be able to represent them in the Legislature.", "I want to first of all applaud the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore for this private member’s bill that speaks to some concerning issues in the city of Toronto. In my riding of Trinity–Spadina, we’ve experienced explosive growth in the downtown core. I’ve lived there for the last 14 years, so I’ve witnessed first-hand what type of growth we are experiencing there, and I want to share some of that experience today in this House.", "At first, it was quite exciting to see the gentrification of my riding. You see new development projects happening; you see new shops coming in. As I was experiencing significant stages in my life—getting married, having kids and acquiring property myself—I started to realize that there is a significant lack of services and infrastructure in this riding, things like green spaces, parks. In the downtown core, we don’t have the luxury of having big front yards and backyards, so we have very tiny ones. We need green spaces and public parks where we can walk our dogs or take our kids to a playground. We don’t have that much space left in the downtown core.", "Again, daycares and schools: When a lot of people moved into those condos at first, it was closer to work, so they figured it was a transitional place: “I’m just going to be there for a few years.” But after five years, six years, close to 10 years, they want to form a family, start raising kids, so they’re looking around for daycare spaces and schools, and they can’t find any—all these problems.", "The biggest issue I heard while knocking on doors earlier this summer was transit, congestion. The root cause of all of this inadequate infrastructure—there’s something wrong with the current planning system. I’ve spoken to many residents who said to me that they want to make sure the local elected officers, including councillors and, quite honestly, their MPPs, get involved in making sure that these planning decisions stay local. The residents’ association should actually have a say in how their community should look in the next little while.", "I think this bill brought out something that’s very interesting: proposing some predictability in the planning system we have right now in the city of Toronto.", "Also, it talks about eliminating the possibility of someone who may be playing some little game with the existing system; for example, if I were to develop a condo and I come to an agreement to build 30 storeys—and I need to go through the amendments of the zoning bylaw to achieve that—but after a couple of years, right before I start building it, after I pre-sold so many units, I go to the city and say, “I want to change that. I want additional height and density in this.” I think this bill is effective to eliminate these kinds of possibilities, because to me, there is also a consumer protection aspect to it. If I’m an investor and I put my money down to buy a condo—it could be for my own living or it could be a rental unit—and two years after, I find out there’s additional height, additional density in this condo I’m buying into, I may not be too happy with that. If I were going to have a family later on, I would be concerned about the density in the community that I’m living in.", "Another key issue I hear over and over again is the so-called section 37. Basically, for those of you viewers who are not too familiar with this, it’s a section that allows the municipalities to be compensated for additional height and density, but there is a serious lack of transparency right now about section 37. We don’t know how much exactly is there from section 37.", "The money, I assume, is well-used to bring additional infrastructure to the community, whether it’s a park, whether it’s a community centre, whether it is some art on the street to promote cultural diversity that we have the pleasure of enjoying in the downtown core, but we don’t know how much is in there. Really, the money was meant for more service, more infrastructure—perhaps a school—those necessities that a community cannot go without, especially in the case of extra density.", "I would like to share some of my time with my colleague from Beaches–East York, but I think this bill has shone some light on some of the possibilities. Quite honestly, I think it’s quite creative. I’m glad we have a member who was the chair in the city of Toronto’s planning and growth management committee for quite a lengthy time, and very knowledgeable on this issue. It’s fortunate for the House to have a member like the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore.", "One last thing I want to share with the House is that I myself personally attended and participated in a public consultation last winter with regard to OMB reform. It is public consultation. It is across the province. I myself was in it, and I heard a lot of suggestions about changes to the Planning Act. I think this bill brought up this awareness and this need to maybe take a look at some changes.", "I also want to mention that my predecessor, the former member for Trinity–Spadina, Mr. Rosario Marchese, was a strong advocate for making sure that planning decisions stay local, although I disagreed with his private member’s bill with regard to exempting Toronto from the OMB, because I think that that will put the community in a place where there is no appeal body. Again, this bill talks about different tools to realize that option of having a minor variance appeal body at the municipal level.", "So I welcome the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore’s private member’s bill. I feel very personally attached to this bill and I look forward to discussing this more in the future." ],

My first one was on limiting the powers of prorogation, and I don’t know—that died on the order paper after 11 days here. The whole place closed it down.", "But I’m going to tell you why I think the Ontario Municipal Board needs reforming, and I’m happy to see you touch on it in here. The member had said that municipalities don’t have the tools to manage or negotiate with developers. I am the first person to concede that municipalities have a very tension-filled, awkward relationship with developers. Some of those developers are incredibly aggressive. Some of them make certain donations. There is an influence. Some of them are very progressive, and they understand. They have bought the intensification model, which we fully support.", "But Waterloo region was targeted by the Places to Grow legislation as a region which should grow to a certain amount and the province told the region of Waterloo how to grow. So they set about doing the consultation—almost 10 full years of thorough consultation. I will say this about the residents of Kitchener–Waterloo: They are informed; they are engaged. If they become enraged, they become even more engaged. So they showed up, and they helped the region shape what is a very progressive plan for growing, forward.", "They developed this long-range, strategic plan for growth. It has hard lines around our rural areas. It has targeted neighbourhoods for intensification. It’s built all the way along the LRT, which is a joint project with the province. The province did originally say they were going to give two thirds, then they said one third and, fingers crossed, the money will flow. That project is going to go ahead, and the success of that project is very much dependent on a progressive plan.", "The region developed their plan and tabled it. It was challenged by developers to the Ontario Municipal Board. The Ontario Municipal Board found in favour of the developers, and not by a small amount. The region wants to grow by 84 hectares. The OMB said, “No, you’re going to grow by 1,084 hectares.” They overruled 10 years of consultation and 10 years of planning. They overruled the province. This is a big thing; right? So the province joined the region of Waterloo in the appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board. This is how crazy it is. The Liberal government is joining the region of Waterloo to protest the OMB not upholding its own provincial legislation.", "It gets even better. It’s Thursday afternoon; I’m trying to keep us awake here.", "Then there was the question of bias on behalf of one of the lawyers because she had done some sort of work with the OMB and she was part of the OMB. So then the Ontario Municipal Board decided to investigate themselves to see if they were biased. This is Monty Python material here.", "It’s very clear that the Ontario Municipal Board needs to be reformed on the operational side, not just the travelling road show that happened last year where everyone got together and said, “I like it,” or, “I don’t like it.” Who cares about liking it or not liking it? It’s supposed to uphold provincial legislation, and it’s not. These members on these boards are overruling municipalities and therefore they are overruling the democratic rights of the municipalities who are duly elected by the citizens, so therefore they are undermining democracy in the province of Ontario. It’s a really big thing.", "Some people say, “We need it.” You know what? I don’t think it can be fixed. I don’t think that it can be fixed. Our member from Trinity–Spadina last year said, “For municipalities who have the capacity, who have the wherewithal, who have the knowledge to develop a progressive planning strategy, they should not be subjected to the Ontario Municipal Board overruling those local decisions.”", "To conclude, there is a cost to an unelected, unaccountable board overruling municipalities, both from an environmental perspective—that’s a cost to the local taxpayers because infrastructure investment gets spread out. Obviously, there’s a problem with funding infrastructure; that’s why the Liberal government is so desperately trying to find cash in all the wrong places.", "I am a little bit hopeful—that little kernel. I’m hopeful that the member, in his experience, can convince the Liberal government to follow what all of us know to be true: that if intensification is going to be successful, if the province does want us to grow in a progressive, affordable and sustainable way so that we can have shared prosperity in the province of Ontario, then the Ontario Municipal Board needs to be either pulled out or restructured. On this side of the House, we just don’t have the faith in the Liberal government to fix it entirely, and we do not think that the municipalities should undermined by the Ontario Municipal Board.", "In case you didn’t realize, I feel pretty strongly about it. I hope that the region is successful in its appeal because it’s costing everybody. Progressive planning should be a win-win-win for everybody, and in this case, it is not. So we’re going to be supporting this bill." ],

Certainly, in my riding in Beaches–East York, this was one of the most important issues going door to door, particularly in the southern end of the ward, known as the Beach. The residents’ associations were up in arms about the repeated—repeated—attacks on democratically elected decision-making at the municipal level because, ultimately, the OMB was interpreting rules that were so broad in a way that was not satisfying the neighbourhoods.", "I have so many neighbourhood associations in my riding. You have to appreciate that the Greater Beaches Neighbourhood Association is an umbrella group now of the Beach Triangle Association, the Kew Beach Neighbourhood Association, Toronto Beach East Residents Association, Friends of Glen Davis Ravine, the Norwood Park Neighbourhood Association, the Beach Waterfront Community Association and the Balmy Beach Residents Association. There’s even the Danforth East Community Association and Kingston Road Village.", "Every single part of my riding is so well-represented because the greatest benefit we got from the OMB over the years is a rallying cry for residents to come together and say, “They’re going to do what?” We’ve seen this time and time again as developments come up, and residents are fighting because they want to preserve the unique characters of their neighbourhoods. The developer comes in on the basis of a very vaguely worded official plan. The neighbours say, “Well, we can’t have this building. It’s too big. It’s dominating. The traffic studies are fake. The whole character of the cladding is wrong. It’s going to change the character of the neighbourhood.” So they rally together and they discover how expensive it is to go to the OMB. They discover how long it is and that they’re outgunned.", "What I find fascinating about the member for Oxford—and I always enjoy listening to your remarks. You’re so well informed on so many of these aspects. Interestingly enough, I get the sense that your residents’ associations want to use the OMB to protect against bad decision-making at a local level, where our residents’ associations don’t want the OMB to protect developers from good decision-making in our municipalities." ],

The difference here is, once they make a plan or a bylaw, then for a certain period of time, that is the law.

  "text" : [ "I am pleased today to rise to speak to Bill 21, the Safeguarding Health Care Integrity Act. This bill would prohibit the sale of plasma and blood products in Ontario. While I appreciate the intent of this bill to protect those who are in need of plasma, I also have concerns that this bill will, in fact, reduce the supply of much-needed blood products.", "My first comment on looking at this bill is that I find it ironic that this bill sets out to stop the sale and purchase of blood products in Ontario. Meanwhile, as we speak, 70% of Ontario’s plasma comes from the United States, where plasma donors are paid. This just seems incredible to me, that there is this urgency by this government to stop the sale and purchase of blood products; meanwhile, they buy them from the US, where donors are paid. I guess what it means is that as long as we don’t do it physically ourselves, we’re willing to bend the principle of only donated blood.", "The bill would not change Ontario’s importing of plasma that was purchased beyond our borders. I’m really not quite sure why the government thinks it’s logical to disallow the purchase of plasma in Ontario but allow the purchase of plasma from other jurisdictions where the plasma, in fact, has been purchased. This is certainly a paradox in my mind.", "I am concerned that without the ability to purchase plasma, Ontario will have a shortage of the life-saving blood product. Currently, Ontario collects enough plasma for transfusions, but does not produce enough plasma protein products to be entirely self-sufficient. I think all of us have heard the advertising by the blood agency about how many contributions are necessary for an accident and things like that.", "Instead of making the purchase of plasma illegal, perhaps the government can look at other solutions to increase the supply. Some patients in need of plasma require upwards of 1,000 donations each year. That means there have to be more than three donors per day. Demand is high, and it’s only increasing. We must ensure that we have adequate supply. That surely has to be the most important aspect.", "I would like to echo my colleague from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, who recently called on the government to consult with stakeholders on Bill 21 to ensure those who would be affected by the bill have some input. This bill is complicated and has a life-or-death potential for its stakeholders, unfortunately. It is not a bill that we can just pass and not think about the consequences. We are impacting people’s lives here, and in some cases whether they live or not. How can we not let those involved have a say in this bill? It is not right.", "I know the government does not like to consult with people whom they are directly impacting. The child care file is an example, with providers and families affected by decreased child care spaces and rising costs because of Bill 10. But we should always consider our obligation to consult. People have a right to express their opinions. We need to let people whose lives depend on plasma have a choice on how they receive their life-saving product. If an individual is comfortable with the sale and purchase of a donor’s plasma, then they should have that option knowing full well that checks and safeguards are already in place to keep people safe.", "Recently, the Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association, PPTA, came to Queen’s Park to discuss with us, as members, the importance of this plasma. This association represents over 450 human plasma collection centres in North America and Europe, as well as the manufacturers of life-saving plasma protein therapies. Their members produce 80% of the plasma protein therapies in the US and 60% of those manufactured in Europe. They collaborate with more than 20 patient advocacy organizations. Collaboration, by the way, is something we should be doing as well with Bill 21.", "According to the PPTA, patient groups are not opposed to compensated plasma donations, and using plasma from compensated donors is not unsafe. According to the PPTA, over the past 20 years there has not been a single reported transmission of HIV or hepatitis through any plasma collection by certified paid plasma donors. There are rigorous safety tests and standards in place in order to protect recipients of plasma donations. For these reasons, the PPTA opposes Bill 21.", "Not only do we have to hear from those whose lives are affected by the need for plasma, but we need to hear from front-line health care workers and those who see the day-to-day need for plasma and blood products. I know the Liberal government wants to rush their bills to royal assent, and we’ve had time allocations that have cut off the debate of many important bills, but I think this is an irresponsible course of action for Bill 21.", "The College of Physicians and Surgeons have asked for consultations on this bill. I think that when a group like this suggests consultations, they should be mandatory. Who better to speak to a bill pertaining to our health care system than front-line health care workers? They know the urgent need for plasma better than anyone else. They see it every day. We need to hear their perspective and their ideas on what we should be doing to increase the supply of plasma, because they might have more interesting and innovative ideas than those which we have here in the Legislature.", "We at Queen’s Park do not have a monopoly on good ideas. Now, more than ever, we are seeing an increasing demand for plasma, as it is being used not just for emergency situations and short-term treatments but we are also seeing plasma used for other life-saving treatments and pharmaceutical products—for instance, those that help combat Alzheimer’s and hemophilia. We must ensure that we don’t have a shortage of plasma for those who need it immediately and for those who need it for their daily medical treatments.", "As we see an increased demand for plasma, we will be stuck with the question of how we are able to receive more: either by increased donations here in Ontario or perhaps an increased purchase of plasma from the United States—again, where it is purchased from donors. In Ontario, where we have had a tradition of donated blood products, this is admirable. But it has also changed over time: There are so many uses that the blood products can be used for that the demand is growing as not only the population grows, and therefore just a natural increase that way, but it’s the increase in the usage of the blood products that means that this kind of challenge is something our health care providers have to deal with.", "As I said at the very beginning, it seems to me that there’s no greater, higher, moral ground for us to argue that we’ll buy it from somebody else outside our borders but we won’t buy it from people within our borders. That seems very difficult, in my mind, to be able to support and be able to argue that it makes sense, quite frankly.", "In Ontario, there are volunteers who donate plasma, similar to those who donate blood. I applaud these volunteers and thank them for their life-saving contributions and I implore more Ontarians to donate plasma.", "As I just mentioned, we will be seeing an increased demand for plasma as we make advances in medical technology, and we cannot fall behind. The notion that we would fall behind because of a shortage is just unconscionable. The process by which we acquire—as I said moments ago, it is hard to justify why we can pay for it coming from somewhere else but we can’t pay for it coming from our own homes.", "People count on these technologies, and we must ensure that we have the products for the treatments so that people can continue to live. I know that in this debate we have spoken about the Krever report, which studied the tainted blood scandal of the 1980s and made recommendations. I would like to cite from the report, which illustrates the difference between the 1980s and today—specifically, the technology and safeguards that have been implemented in the last 30 years which make our blood and plasma donation system safer. The report also cites the lack of oversight of donations, especially compared to the US and other countries:", "“The US Food and Drug Administration exercised a regulatory function over the US blood industry. It licensed and inspected blood banks that were involved in interstate commerce. It not only made regulations, but also supervised the blood industry by issuing guidelines and recommendations that were more than advisory. Compliance by the blood industry was expected and obtained. In Canada, the federal government”—this is the 1980s we’re talking about—“regulated the manufacture of blood products and the collection of plasma by plasmapheresis, but it did not actively regulate the collection and processing of whole blood. Unlike its US counterpart, the Department of National Health and Welfare never issued guidelines or recommendations for the collection of blood in Canada. Until the summer of 1985, neither the federal government nor the provincial governments gave the Red Cross directions or showed any leadership in helping the Red Cross to cope with issues of transfusion-associated AIDS.”", "Furthermore, Canada did not screen donors as rigorously as we should have. I thought back to my own personal experience in the 1980s. Prior to being unable to donate blood, I regularly donated blood, as I thought it was sort of a civic duty, and I was healthy enough and so forth. But I do remember that it was by the individual—when they were asked about any illnesses they had. There was no proof; you just went in and said, “No, I don’t have this.” Certainly, there were people who did have blood disorders that they may not have known about themselves. The notion that we did not screen donors as rigorously as we should have is putting it mildly.", "“The risk-reduction measures used in Canada can be summarized briefly. As early as January 1983, the Canadian Red Cross Society proposed that it would adopt the joint statement of the US blood bankers as a working policy, subject to approval by the medical directors of its 17 blood centres. That approval was given unanimously. In the months that followed, the Red Cross did not, however, implement any of the recommendations in the joint statement. In particular it did not implement the recommendation that ‘all donors should be asked questions designed to elicit a history of night sweats, unexplained fevers, unexpected weight loss, lymphadenopathy or Kaposi’s sarcoma,’ the signs and symptoms of AIDS....", "“The information known in the period … was sufficient for public health officials, regulators, and blood bankers in the United States, western Europe, and Australia to take preventive action to restrict the blood supply from persons at high risk of contracting AIDS. It should have prompted a similar response in Canada.”", "Health Canada addresses the safety of paid plasma donors. Its response:", "“Lessons of the tainted blood crisis must never be forgotten, and action has been taken since then to help prevent a tragedy like that from happening again. There are no plans to change Canada’s voluntary blood for transfusion donor system. However, technological advancements have made plasma products safer. New measures such as heat treatment, filtration or treatment with chemicals have been put into place to remove or inactivate viruses or other contaminants when producing blood products from plasma. There has not been a single case of transmission of hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV caused by plasma products in Canada since the introduction of modern manufacturing practices over 25 years ago, despite the fact that most of the plasma donors were paid.”", "I think it’s really important to emphasize the conclusion here. What we are saying is that with technology, with the kinds of opportunities to adopt the best practices of other jurisdictions, it’s very clear from the record that our blood supply is safe. It has nothing to do with whether the individuals were paid or unpaid donors.", "The fact that this bill suggests that somehow there’s some kind of medical or moral ground, as I already mentioned—to suggest that it’s okay if we import it from somewhere and they pay, and therefore we have to pay, but we’re not prepared to do that for the people of this province.", "I think what we see from the quote from Health Canada sums up the argument that the status quo is working. The Liberals are seeking to change a system that is not broken and are yet again refusing to hear from the medical experts, the people in the field who are the most experienced." ],

Rather than focusing on health and providing that, we’re focusing on—well, not we, but we’re seeing a trend in those who are offering care to want to be paid for it, to make that profit, and that shouldn’t be the focus. It should be about providing care, not providing wealth.", "We’re seeing a trend in the upselling of procedures and treatments just to make more money off patients. This shouldn’t be allowed. We’re seeing medically superfluous tests that provide profits rather than necessary results. We’re hearing more about medical tourism—my point being, we’re seeing a trend in money being the focus rather than health. This is another place where the system can’t be undermined for the sake of making a buck.", "We know that there are dangerous loopholes, and we’d like to see them closed. We’d like to see the government really stand up, focus attention and stop turning a blind eye. We need oversight. I might be going off in a different direction, but we need oversight, and you can’t see things with a blind eye.", "We had the opportunity earlier to meet with some people talking to us about poverty reduction.

It’s an honour to stand before you today to speak about Bill 21.", "Our voluntary blood system ensures that blood and plasma collection in this province remains safe and true to our common values. Health Canada, as we all know, has received licence applications from a for-profit company to open plasma collection sites in Ontario that would pay people for their plasma. Health Canada has left that decision up to the provinces, and since this matter arose, we have heard from many health care organizations, advocacy groups and individual Ontarians who are opposed to private, for-profit plasma collection. We have to listen to these voices. They have serious concerns about the safety and integrity of our blood system. Why? Because allowing payment for our blood puts our system at risk. It’s at risk of abuse, it’s at risk of unsafe practices, it’s at risk of people jeopardizing their health and the health of others in order to make a fast buck, as the member from Oshawa mentioned. It makes me uneasy about the notion of paying for bodily fluids or anything else in this vein—pardon the wording.", "In addition, the member from York–Simcoe says there aren’t any instances of unsafe paid plasma donations. But I know that if it were to happen that there was an instance of lack of safety in this, the members opposite would be the first to ask why we didn’t protect it.", "I think that this is a system that works. That is why our government is taking steps to protect the integrity of our national public blood donation system and to avoid the development of a parallel private collection system in Ontario.

It is just reality; you might as well deal with it.", "I was happy to hear the member from Halton, on the government side, say that we need to hear from the professionals, and we do.

  "text" : [ "I’m honoured to rise today on behalf of the residents of Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry to speak to Bill 166, the Strengthening Protection for Ontario Consumers Act. At long last, reform of the Tarion Corp. and new home warranties in Ontario comes to this Legislature. Ever since my election in 2011 and my first appointment as critic to consumer services, I’ve heard many individuals and groups who related their ongoing gripes with Tarion and highlighted the challenges faced by ordinary Ontarians when trying to enforce what many of us would consider a basic requirement of buying a home in Ontario: buying one that is well built, safe and the one the buyers want.", "For most of us, our home will be our life’s largest investment. In the GTA, acquiring a place to call home can easily entail committing more than 10 years’ worth of an individual’s gross wages to the transaction. When we factor in other expenses, such as taxes, utilities and the cost of day-to-day life, our home becomes an asset around which much of our current and future net worth revolves.", "Defects compromise not just homes and their value, but compromise an entire family’s future. Ontarians don’t only need to contend with Tarion and with the builder to see that their investment is safeguarded, they must keep their timely payments on a mortgage, whose value probably exceeds that of the defective house. This isn’t a situation any family would want to find themselves in.", "Construction gauges our economy. When builders build, it is a sign of confidence in future growth and prosperity. Through obligations and programs such as the building code and new home warranties, the government seeks to ensure that the construction doesn’t happen just for construction’s sake, and aims to enforce a consistent, minimum standard of safety and suitability for habitation.", "Consumers and experts have known for a long time that this enforcement role should not be combined with that of the builder, yet that’s exactly how Tarion has worked. Consumers have demanded a better system for years, asking for a regulatory framework where they could trust the arbitrators and resolve their disputes efficiently. When the government finally took the initiative and ordered a review be conducted by Justice Cunningham, many breathed a sigh of relief.", "Before I continue, I would like to point out some of the concerns raised by those who participated in the consultations with Justice Cunningham. Many consumers were uncertain as to how their participation in the consultation, whether through a written submission or the oral presentations made at one of the round tables, would impact their current disputes with Tarion, some of which had reached the tribunal level.", "The unfortunate reality for many Ontarians is that they do not need to develop an in-depth knowledge of a system such as Tarion and home warranties until an issue arises and they hit a wall. While the justice was thorough and accommodating of numerous individual needs, we should keep in mind that many individuals who had witnessed those less-than-desirable characteristics of a new home warranty framework in Ontario may have been deterred from providing feedback.", "I attended one of the justice’s round table consultations in Toronto as an observer and I was surprised by the small number of individuals present. This was not an isolated incident. Consumers who got in touch with my office reported low attendance at other public consultations held throughout the province.", "The climate was such that consumers who had legitimate grievances about the system’s workings were concerned about the possible negative consequences and outcomes in their disputes with Tarion if they voiced them, leading to more legal expenses, a devaluation of their home or the loss of the home altogether if the defects rendered it uninhabitable. How could such a concern even be conceivable in the province of Ontario?", "We have an expectation of fairness and impartiality in our dispute resolution system, whether through the courts or through alternative means. As Justice Cunningham said in his report, the multiple functions carried out by Tarion made conflicting priorities possible within the organization. It acts as a regulator for the building industry, as the monopoly warranty provider and as the arbitrator in disputes between the builder and the consumer. It created a situation where the judge could be thought to have an interest in the case’s outcome, a situation Justice Cunningham recommended we resolve by removing some duties from Tarion and keeping it just as the regulator for the industry.", "The justice, however, did not simply recommend splitting one monopoly into two agencies. Recommendation number 1 from the report highlighted that Ontario should follow the model already used internationally and in provinces such as Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan, where new home warranties were offered in a competitive market.", "In this bill, we see the current act governing Tarion repealed and substituted with two acts establishing just two authorities but continuing the new home warranty plan and mandating that new homes be registered with it. The mandatory nature of the new home enrolment makes competition in new home warranty provision impossible, as it makes no sense for builders to pay twice for the same insurance product: once to the warranty authority and once to a private insurer.", "Competition in a market with set and enforced minimum standards is a good thing. Competing for the same customer base encourages providers to enhance their product, reduce their price or improve their service, or all of the above. This happens on a daily basis in other businesses and there is no reason to assume consumers would not be well served by a well-regulated, competitive new home warranty marketplace.", "Earlier this year, I wrote to the minister highlighting that, as legislators, we can give the government many options to implement legislation gradually without having to come to the House every time. Gradual implementation of the justice’s recommendations can be achieved by proclaiming new acts or new sections as key stakeholders become ready to transition to the new regulatory framework. What we see in this bill instead is the creation of a new warranty monopoly without the corresponding future ability to create a competitive warranty market.", "The government is also continuing the current system under which the warranty of a new home is not an insurance product subject to strict oversight and control by financial oversight bodies, but an assurance from the builder to the buyer.", "This goes against Justice Cunningham’s recommendation number 3 which explicitly stated that new home warranties should be an insurance product. This definition change could bring many benefits. First and foremost, providers of insurance are subject to much stricter oversight standards than conventional delegated authorities are. The ministry’s model for delegated authorities changed in recent years with the routine introduction of Auditor General oversight into legislation. However, this is a far cry from the level of oversight exercised over insurance providers.", "Here’s Justice Cunningham’s list from his report:", "“—requirements for minimum capital;", "“—corporate governance rules;", "“—investment restrictions;", "“—reporting requirements to a designated statistical agency and to the Superintendent of Financial Services ...;", "“—obligation to refrain from defined unfair and deceptive practices;", "“—requirement to contribute to a compensation association that compensates policyholders who suffer loss when an insurer becomes insolvent; and", "“—obligations to comply with various requirements regarding the insurance policy and the handling of claims;”", "—a mandatory complaint process; and", "—lastly, dispute resolution through the Financial Services Commission of Ontario and the General Insurance OmbudService.", "Tarion, as it is today, has an internal ombudsman tasked with resolving complaints arising from the handling of consumer claims against their builders. It may be better than nothing, but it does not provide the same level of independent oversight as the Ombudsman of Ontario, FSCO or the General Insurance OmbudService can provide.", "We are disappointed that the government has not considered all the recommendations of the Cunningham report. There is little to no need to create new products or craft brand new legislative frameworks. Providers of new home insurance in those provinces with a competitive marketplace have expressed interest in serving Ontarians and making their products available to them. Clearly, there is an appetite among consumers and among potential, regulated and accountable providers for change which, to date, this government has not delivered.", "Throughout the Tarion review and the nine years that led to it, consumers have complained both openly and in confidence about the procedures in place for making a claim with Tarion and resolving it through the administrative and legal means. In particular, stakeholders highlighted the need to reduce the cost and time commitment required to resolve a complaint in a definitive manner.", "Justice Cunningham’s report contains several recommendations concerning the dispute resolution process. He documented consumers’ concerns with the current system effectively and extensively, noting how the involvement with a monopoly regulator and the warranty provider caused a perception of an inequitable process.", "Moreover, adjudication by an independent body would help deliver a fresh look at warranty claim disputes that the consumer and the warranty provider have not been able to resolve. A fresh-look component is important. By the time the dispute reaches adjudication, both the consumer and the warranty provider have formed significantly entrenched opinions regarding the claim and the facts presented therein. Independent and impartial review helps bring an objective perspective to what can be today instead a greatly contentious process.", "In recommendations 20 and 21, Justice Cunningham highlighted that any alternative or complementary dispute resolution process implemented under these new provisions should coexist with—not substitute itself to—existing homeowners’ rights to sue and pursue appeals through our court system.", "The courts also guarantee a certain standard and an array of remedies that are available to consumers in the case of a victory. I am pleased to see that the government has explicitly guaranteed the explicit continuation of existing remedies in section 52(18), although they gave themselves the power to affect these existing remedies by regulation.", "This is not an approach we can agree with. Ontarians have the rightful expectation to be able to take an issue to court or a tribunal or an adjudicator, and to have access to these remedies that will resolve the issue completely. If and when this right is to be taken away, and the remedies available to consumers against the warranty provider or the builder are to be restricted, such a provision should come to the floor of this House for a full debate and examination. Giving the minister the power to unilaterally remove remedies is far too big a step.", "Regulation is an effective tool for clarifying details that are either too cumbersome to put in legislation or that are subject to frequent change and would grind this House to a halt if they were to be approved in their new form in three readings every time they were to be altered. The building code is an example of such a regulation, as are electrical and technical safety standards. They all have a common thread uniting them: any reasonable person in Ontario would expect some form of regulation to exist in that sector. The public might not know what the regulation says, but they know that a regulation probably exists.", "There is no reason for any Ontarian to expect that their right to a certain level of compensation or a certain standard of performance has been taken away.", "There is little awareness among Ontarians of the difference between legislation and regulation, or of the fact that regulations do not go through the House but are approved at the ministry level and come into force when they are filed electronically and displayed on e-Laws, a resource most Ontarians might not know exists.", "To give the government a blanket power to remove or limit the existing remedies, including potentially those previously awarded in other disputes, does not serve either the cause of fairness or that of transparency.", "Dispute resolution was clearly a sore point for many consumers and other stakeholders who came to Justice Cunningham with feedback. More than a quarter of the recommendations of this report—nine of the 37 total—address issues that arise when a consumer and the warranty provider disagree over a claim.", "Here are some of the issues he addressed:", "—independent, neutral and accessible process;", "—review of decisions of the independent adjudicator;", "—the right to sue;", "—the role of a warranty provider in dispute resolution;", "—flexible and accessible process;", "—the costs of the adjudication;", "—onus of proof;", "—the use of experts; and", "—self-represented litigants.", "I would like to touch on some of these recommendations before continuing.", "Access to justice, whether it comes in the form of court action, administrative tribunals or some form of alternative dispute resolution, relies on some key principles, among which are clear rules, clear standards of evidence, and affordability.", "For many homeowners, the current state of affairs made appeals against warranty decisions prohibitively expensive, and therefore potentially deterred legitimate claims from proceeding to a rightful appeal.", "Justice Cunningham pointed out that consumers today face a significant burden of costs associated with pursuing a warranty claim through the process, including at the Licence Appeal Tribunal.", "Firstly, navigating the system with any degree of certainty requires specialized knowledge and necessitates the hiring of skilled legal counsel. My office often welcomes constituents who are in need of guidance for appeals. Most often, these issues involve social assistance decisions and rental disputes. In all of these cases, we seek to direct the constituent to legal resources to ensure they have the best shot at presenting their case. In many instances, the combination of the constituent’s complaint and their income makes them eligible to receive legal aid.", "For many new homeowners, this is not an option. Legal costs begin adding up, putting additional pressure on a family budget already strained by a mortgage and the other costs associated with the defect in question.", "Many consumers are forced by circumstances to self-represent and have to overcome an additional challenge of well-represented opposition in the face of Tarion and the builders themselves.", "Justice Cunningham was clear: The proceedings must be solely between the consumer and the warranty authority that would pay out the claim. We are pleased to see that the government has taken this recommendation on board fully by specifying in the new act that the parties to a hearing before the tribunal are the consumer and the authority alone. The recommendations related to self-represented consumers can help make the process easier for them, especially through increased training for tribunal members regarding self-represented applicants.", "A clearer and more concise statement of the procedures and aims for the tribunal hearing can also help self-represented appellants prepare their presentations and evidence in a way that will deliver their argument effectively and in the appropriate formats. Despite this, the PC caucus and I agree with the review’s overall drive to make sure disputes have every opportunity to de-escalate before they end up before a tribunal. To this end, the recommendations include a mandatory internal dispute resolution process and access to independent adjudication. Beyond legal costs, other expense considerations deter current consumers from pursuing current claims further.", "As Justice Cunningham stated in his report, the current framework does not determine who carries the onus of proof into a warranty dispute. Because of this ambiguity, consumers feel that they must engage professional experts to carry out assessments and investigations on their property to determine a set of facts related to the claim and bring the experts’ conclusions to a hearing where they are likely to be contrasted with those of experts hired by the builder or the warranty authority. Aside from duplicating work, this situation also causes an escalation of claims costs to the authority and the consumer, as well as tying up the tribunal’s resources.", "I am an engineer, and I am very much aware of the cost of specialist engineering and assessment services. When bad construction is an issue, it shouldn’t be a matter of pitting one expert’s opinion against the other. Justice Cunningham understood this well and did recommend that an adjudicator could hire an expert to assess the situation and deliver an objective statement of facts.", "Bill 166 takes a small step towards making the warranty claim process easier for consumers, but falls short of implementing the full guarantees envisioned by Justice Cunningham. The consumer is now only required to show the symptoms of a defect rather than proving its cause in order to make a claim. This makes the process of initiating a claim easier, and it is bound to help many consumers who might discover a defect only a short time before the expiry of the prescribed warranty period.", "As an example, a two-year warranty period covers defects that may result in water penetration into the building, whether through foundations, the walls or windows. By clarifying that the consumer need only to prove the symptom of the problem rather than the cause, Bill 166 will make it possible for somebody to initiate a claim the moment they see water damage without having to hire somebody to investigate the problem to determine if the water indeed came from the windows rather than through a bad roofing job.", "These changes are also inserted into Tarion’s existing enabling legislation, but only upon proclamation rather than royal assent, meaning only consumers who haven’t had their claims decided on by Tarion will benefit from the new provisions. This doesn’t help many categories of consumers. First, it offers no help to those consumers whose claims have already been dismissed and who, for one reason or another, including high legal and expertise costs, could not pursue a potentially legitimate claim further at a tribunal. We can understand the lack of recourse for someone who has already lost at a tribunal: what has been judged is final. This is an essential part of the separation between our power and that of the judiciary. There should be still a legitimate debate as to how we can better protect those consumers who have not yet taken the appeal step or who may be facing the prospect of making a claim regarding their new home.", "Secondly, it provides no guarantee to today’s new home buyers as to when the new, simpler and more manageable burden of proof will take effect. For all they know, they could buy a home today, and by the time they have to file their two-year claim—or even their seven-year one—the new standard of evidence may not have been proclaimed and they would face the same hurdles as many consumers who have come forward during the Cunningham review to voice their dissatisfaction.", "Enacting this bill in its current form also risks creating a particularly unpleasant incentive for Tarion. The section that amends the Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act states that only claims that have not yet been decided on by the Tarion Warranty Corp. at the time of the proclamation are eligible to be considered under the new burden of proof. Consumers who are either currently or soon to be embroiled in the first stages of a claim should be able to count on this Legislature to see that justice and fairness are enforced and seen to be enforced. Their confidence in the legislation and the procedures underpinning Tarion as it exists today are borne in part from a perception that the deck is stacked against the consumer. However much confidence we may have in Tarion, we should consider providing consumers with a clear indication of our intent to reform the current claim system and do better by consumers through a clause that would make consumers eligible for consideration under the new regime for claims under consideration or filed after the day the bill was introduced. This is not an unreasonable proposition.", "The original version of the Cunningham report was received by this government in December 2016, over 10 months ago. In the time since, the government would have worked with key stakeholders and with Tarion, in conjunction with the additional working group they convened, to hammer out the details of how the report’s recommendations would have been implemented. The changes to the burden of proof provisions should therefore come as no surprise to Tarion. Making the burden of proof reform retroactive to the day of the bill’s introduction would be the least we can do, as legislators, to cement in consumers’ minds the confidence that we are committed to changing the new home warranty disputes.", "Consumers are, unfortunately, right to be skeptical of the government’s commitment to following through on a comprehensive and detailed review such as Justice Cunningham’s. As just one example, since the early 2000s experts in the health sector have called for a minimum legislated standard of care, yet the government hasn’t committed to one yet. Ontarians who wished to see changes in how beer, wine and spirits were sold in Ontario have been waiting for years, since 2005, when a reputable report to then-Minister Greg Sorbara recommended sweeping changes to the LCBO.", "With this report, matters were even more complicated. Justice Cunningham’s original scheduled report release date of June 2016 had to be pushed back as a result of the multitude of issues brought to light by consumers and stakeholders who had plenty of experience and knowledge to share. This turned out to be a much deeper investigation than was originally envisioned by the government.", "The then-minister’s remarks certainly prove that the government expected a fairly smooth ride through the review process. In the Toronto Star article on the initiation of the Tarion review, Minister Orazietti was quoted as saying that he expected the review to endorse the status quo and to find Tarion an effective consumer protector. He would not have used those words unless he had either been briefed so, or held a genuine belief to that effect. In both cases, Justice Cunningham’s feedback during his work on the review would have likely come as a shock and shown consumers that the government had an unexpected reform on its agenda.", "The delegated authority model was created for the purpose of industry-led self-regulation in those sectors where public safety and confidence needed to be preserved but direct government intervention would have been cumbersome. This is the vein in which the Technical Standards and Safety Authority, the Electrical Safety Authority, the Travel Industry Council of Ontario, the Real Estate Council of Ontario, Tarion and other agencies should operate. This model was not, however, designed to exist outside of government oversight or leadership, yet this is precisely what the present government has allowed to happen. When consumers and the opposition brought significant issues with agencies such as the TSSA to the government’s attention, the usual response was that the authority in question was an arm’s-length corporation. The absence of share capital and a more informal board appointment process made these authorities exempt from oversight by legislative committees. Limits in existing independent officers’ enabling legislation contributed to creating the perception and, in some cases, a culture of opaqueness that does not belong in an agency tasked with administering an Ontario piece of legislation, collecting mandatory membership fees, issuing licences, inspecting licence holders and meting out punishment.", "I commend the present minister for admitting that Tarion has strayed too far from government, and vowing to bring more control over the corporation’s regulation-making power. Bill 166 implements direct ministerial control over the vast portion of Tarion’s regulation-making ability, ensuring that the government of the day bears the responsibility for public policy passed by the corporation. This should be the first step towards a broader reform of the delegated authority model.", "I have called for such a reform for a long time and have a bill on the table to open up such authorities to several trusted oversight bodies and public information tools. For instance, the current government’s approach to creating new agencies includes Auditor General oversight. This may be a positive development, however, it fails to address the complete lack of such oversight at existing authorities.", "The Ontario Ombudsman is not allowed near any delegated authority, and the furthest concession this government has made in that regard is the mandatory appointment of an internal ombudsperson in the new warranty authority. It is, again, a very small step in the right direction, but not nearly enough.", "Licensees who can see their livelihoods threatened if they do not comply with the authority’s every command cannot as much as demand to see the authority’s top salaries. The most recently created authorities in the condominium sector, in home inspections, as well as those envisioned by Bill 166, only require that the agencies disclose salaries in accordance with a ministerial regulation rather than the more comprehensive sunshine list.", "Isn’t it time we stopped taking half-steps when we have the tools and the knowledge to implement reform on a much larger scale, setting ourselves and our institutions up for the next decades rather than catching up to what consumers and businesses have been expecting for just as long?", "The government is no stranger to taking dramatic and sudden action in the wake of public concern or outrage. In the time I have been here, I have been witness to the government’s rushed changes to cool-off periods for water heater contracts, only to see the status quo restored quietly a few years later. When the public demanded their loyalty points stay with them forever, the government stepped in with a rushed piece of legislation that caught all stakeholders by surprise.", "“Consultation” is a word this government often uses, but its meaning changes depending on the prevailing political wind. On one end, the government pays lip service to the concept by hosting pre-budget consultations and having the committee travel the province, yet writes and releases the budget before the committee has even finished hearing people’s feedback and drafting its summary of the hearings. On other occasions, the government outsources its consultative duty to outside agencies and relies on advice that is often drawn from very unrepresentative samples. For instance, the government prepared a major alteration on payday lending regulation in Ontario following discussions in focus groups consisting of less than 20 people in total, drawn entirely from the GTA.", "With the Tarion review, this government laid down a fairly solid foundation for a comprehensive and exhaustive examination of how new home warranties and builder regulations are administered in Ontario. They retained the services of a respected and experienced legal professional and, when needed, granted him additional time and scope to pursue his inquiry. When the report was released, it addressed a vast array of consumer gripes with Tarion as well as institutional accountability and conflict-of-interest issues that had not been addressed before. All that was needed now was the political leadership and the wherewithal to take the report, present it to the ministry’s legislative drafters and state: “Please make this happen.” Alas, this government chose another path, and in doing so impacted the credibility of its commitment to Tarion reform, as well as the confidence Ontarians can have in the broad concept of consultation on major issues affecting our province.", "With Justice Cunningham’s report in hand, the government convened an 11-member working panel appointed entirely under ministry control and bound by confidentiality agreements. Over the course of the first half of 2017, this working panel met and deliberated how to implement changes to Tarion and home warranties.", "If Bill 166 is the result of the working group’s deliberations, then they either were not given the justice’s report or second-guessed it with gusto. This isn’t right, and it sets a bad precedent for the province as a whole. We convene professional and scholarly reviews for the purpose of taking an informed and wise look at how we do things as a government, and seeking advice on how to do them better. When we are told by the reviewer that we need to improve in an area, what kind of mandate do we have to counter this recommendation by saying that everything is fine?", "The time-honoured tradition for this government is to compliment the reviewer, take pictures and shelve the report. In other instances, report recommendations have been cherry-picked and implemented piecemeal, as in the case of Bill 89.", "By taking ownership of their decision to either not proceed with a recommended course of action or to implement some recommendations over others, governments maintain their role as decision-makers in what they believe to be the public interest and remain accountable to the public and to key stakeholders who may wish to voice their discontent.", "In the case of the LCBO report, for instance, it is up to the Minister of Finance to address why something wasn’t done.", "The outstanding action on a recommended legislated four-hour minimum standard of care in long-term-care homes lies squarely on the desk of the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care.", "A member of the public inquiring about the government’s failure to implement a competitive and accountable model for new home warranties will find themselves facing a mire where no one seems to wield the final deciding power and everyone carries an undefined fraction of the blame for failing to act. This form of distributed responsibility strikes against the very heart of what it means to be a government and to be in government. Ministers are there to wield the power vested in their office and in their role with responsibility, judgment and integrity. If the Minister of Government and Consumer Services, or her Premier, did not wish to pursue a competitive provision model, they should have come out and said so openly.", "What Ontarians saw instead was muddied waters. A public and well-publicized review was submitted for deconstruction and second-guessing to an internally appointed panel that has served no purpose but to shield the present government from criticism. We have come to a point where if this government does not want to take an unpopular decision, it simply generates paper and delays until it can say the decision was made for them.", "We all lose from such an approach, first and foremost because important and necessary reforms are not undertaken and sitting governments aren’t held accountable for their failure to act. Secondly, public confidence in the value of the feedback they provide to their own government can and will be shaken to such an extent that eventually people may judge the exercise to not be worth investing their time into.", "When constituents ask me what the use of a written submission to the finance committee was when the budget was already written, I could not give them a satisfactory answer.", "Consumers who have had it with high-cost disputes with Tarion and have had to hire their own experts will be asking where the independent expertise and adjudication that Justice Cunningham wrote about are, and I doubt anyone on the government side of this House will rise and say, “We chose not to have it.”", "By deferring this decision-making process to others, or using as many talking shops as possible to shield themselves from criticism, this government encourages Ontarians to check out of their own provincial affairs. Owning your own decisions and being accountable for them is a mark of respect for those who took their time and resources to come forward and give their opinion, share their knowledge and illustrate their vision for change. It is one of the most basic duties that this government owes to the electors and residents of this province, who collectively trust us to represent and preserve their interest and their future.", "The PC caucus supports splitting the regulator and warranty provider roles of Tarion, and we continue to support Auditor General oversight over new delegated authorities. We furthermore support the government’s initiative to enhance the builder directory by prescribing in legislation a set of absolutely mandatory disclosures that the builder regulator must make public regarding its members.", "We have stated many times that principles that are basic, obvious and unlikely to change are best codified in legislation so consumers and stakeholders have a measure of certainty concerning what is expected of them. This bill allows the minister to prescribe more disclosures; however, we are pleased to see mandatory statements concerning complaints against a builder and disciplinary action taken against a builder by the regulator. Consumers have advocated for such changes and such legislative guarantees for years, and we are pleased to finally see them being implemented.", "We’re also pleased with the prospect of consumers having a lower proof threshold to clear in order to begin filing a claim for compensation under the new home warranty framework. As many advocates have pointed out, the purpose of a warranty, first and foremost, is to protect the consumer against losses. It is therefore not reasonable to expect a consumer to first hire an expert to prove the cause of a water leak into a building when a consumer-oriented agency would take the claim, let its experts assess the causes and, should the consumer disagree, go to appeal. By that same token, auto insurers don’t wait for a determination of fault to begin the claim proceedings.", "Bill 166’s provisions related to Tarion and home warranties are a small step forward for consumers. The failure to implement a competitive model, or at least lay the legislative groundwork to allow it to happen in the future, is a missed opportunity by this government to bring the province’s homeowners to the same level of choice, protection and accountability that homeowners in western provinces have already grown accustomed to.", "I would like to add a few words regarding deposit protection, an issue that gained prominence in recent months with the bankruptcy of a large builder. The amounts protected under the deposit protection scheme administered by Tarion are not written into legislation but determined by Tarion through builder bulletins, which then have almost the same force as a regulation issued by the government.", "In the real estate market we have today, homebuyers have seen the average price of a home in the GTA and elsewhere skyrocket while they were awaiting the construction of the property they put a down payment on. For those whose properties were built, this deposit protected their right to purchase a future property that would have netted them a profit at the moment it was built and transferred to them. Homeowners who paid deposits to builders who cannot deliver the home instead face the prospect of not being able to afford a home with the prices the market charges at that time.", "The bankruptcy of Urbancorp highlighted the low amounts guarantee at the time by Tarion, which did not adequately reflect the deposits required to secure a property in the GTA. The levels have been stuck at $20,000 for condominium units and $40,000 for homes since 2003. Considering deposits are about 10% to 20% of a property’s value, it becomes clear just how far our property boom has come so rapidly; $200,000 condominiums and $400,000 homes are not a reality for many, if not most, homebuyers in the GTA, who instead might have to contend with seven-figure price tags when taxes, fees and interest are factored in. If another Urbancorp happened today, many consumers could find themselves losing a significant portion of their deposit as well as their chance to get on the property ladder.", "Since then, Tarion has launched a review of deposit protection, and I expect the issue to be examined and addressed more frequently than once a decade in the future. This isn’t a duty that belongs solely to Tarion or the future administrative authorities that will replace it. The government must show leadership on the file when called on to do so. When prices for new homes began to climb, the issue of deposit protection amounts should have been obvious. In the wake of the Urbancorp bankruptcy, the government should have taken the initiative and ordered the review or exercised its power to issue regulations that would have made deposit insurance amounts reflect current home prices, and possibly set a mechanism for reviewing or adjusting these amounts on a regular basis depending on market conditions.", "Buying a home is stressful enough. Individuals and families have to contend with finding a home, deciding the bid amount, working with banks for mortgages, paying taxes and fees, and generally begin settling into a brand new environment. When things go wrong that shouldn’t, the warranty provider should be there to tell the consumer that they have their back. Many consumers did not believe Tarion was up to that task, and have called for reform. Today’s bill takes one small step towards making new home warranties work for consumers, but plenty of work still needs to be done.", "I now turn my attention to the part of the bill that concerns real estate brokers. Just like construction, the real estate industry and the professionals who work in it are the canary in the mine of Ontario’s economy. For most individuals, the purchase of a home is as much about their current economic situation as it is about their confidence in the future. Buying your first home often involves a mortgage and a commitment to pay a major portion of one’s income to a bank. The individual and the bank extending the mortgage must agree that the household income level will be sufficient and stable enough to meet the long-term obligation. When either factor is missing, real estate transactions suffer.", "Realtors know this, and they know their communities. It is a competitive industry, and professionals must approach homeowners and prospective buyers proactively every day to ensure that they are known for their professionalism, contacts and willingness to help residents find a home or sell their current property for the best price they can find.", "In some circumstances, a realtor may find that their client list includes a buyer and a seller whose interests match and would probably lead to a successful and mutually convenient transaction. Double representation in this case raises a series of questions that both the realtor and the clients must address before proceeding. The buyer’s interest rests with purchasing the home at the lowest price point the seller is willing to accept, whereas the converse is true for the seller. The government’s changes will limit a realtor’s ability to represent multiple clients in a transaction and also raise the penalties that can be levied against those who contravene the code of ethics established for the real estate profession.", "Having spoken with industry stakeholders, we are aware that these changes come following a period of consultation with the profession and are broadly accepted. We do not oppose additional disclosure requirements for those realtors who do represent more than one party in a real estate deal. Our main objective should continue to be the expansion of public choice and building consumer confidence in the marketplace that they participate in. By preserving consumers’ right to choose their most trusted realtor, even if they represent the other party as well, we recognize the real estate professionals’ role as facilitators of mobility and economic activity in our communities.", "Bill 166 further addresses changes to the way the travel industry is regulated in Ontario. The Travel Industry Act itself hasn’t been revised since 2002, when the last Progressive Conservative government enacted it. Travel has changed significantly since then, driven by rising incomes, rising Internet and computer use, and increased competition in travel services. When the Travel Industry Act first came into force, only a negligible portion of consumers used the Internet to search for travel options. Today, three quarters or more of travel transactions happen online instead of at retail locations.", "Travel booking websites have proliferated and offer their users a variety of experiences, filters and options. Some integrate flights, accommodation and car rentals to build a custom vacation or offer the consumer a set of prearranged options. Some dedicate their services exclusively to one of these categories. Some instead function as aggregators of information given by other websites, allowing the consumer to often choose the cheapest option.", "Regulation of such a distributed service provision model is difficult as individual jurisdictions such as Ontario have to contend with a marketplace where an Ontarian might look at a hotel in Mexico through a service headquartered in Spain, paying with a credit card through a payment system operating out of somewhere else.", "Faced with higher air travel costs, some Ontarians choose to fly out of airports located on the US side of the border. In our case, in Ogdensburg, they opened their airport, extended it a few years ago, and they have seen their service to Florida increase exponentially, as it’s a much cheaper option.", "In this context, travel industry regulators in Ontario need to accomplish three main aims: Firstly, they must ensure Ontario businesses provide the highest service quality to their customers and that consumers are shielded as much as possible from the adverse consequences of a provider’s bankruptcy. Secondly, they must work with providers headquartered out of Ontario, such as major travel websites, to encourage them to comply with Ontario regulation and disclosure requirements.", "It is not rare for consumers shopping online for travel to be presented with one price at the beginning of the transaction, in order to entice them to click through, only to be told that the offer is now no longer available and having the price adjusted upwards. Often, such adjustments happen so inconspicuously that a consumer in a rush might not even notice that the price has spiked until after they press the final pay button.", "In other instances, foreign systems tack on additional, previously undisclosed fees to the final ticket or accommodation price. When combined with high-pressure tactics, such as stating only a few seats are left at this supposedly convenient price, the effect on the consumer travel market is a reduction of overall consumer confidence.", "The travel industry regulator’s third main role is arguably the most important in tackling the impact of such practices on Ontario consumers. The regulator collects fees from its registrants in order to operate, rather than relying on taxpayer funds, and uses a portion of those funds to educate consumers on the guarantees available to them under Ontario’s travel regulation framework and the key issues they need to remember to address before buying and before leaving.", "According to surveys conducted during the Travel Industry Act review, just a fraction of consumers purchased travel health insurance prior to departing from Ontario. Constituents who have come by my office asking about OHIP coverage outside the province are often surprised how little coverage they actually have outside our borders. In such situations, we need to ask ourselves first whether we are covered under our employer’s plan, our pension plan or our credit card, for how long and for exactly what.", "Insurance policies, including travel health ones, can be daunting to read and can be quite complex. This is a massive and varied marketplace catering to individual needs and situations where a one-size-fits-all regulatory approach doesn’t work. The best course of action is to create an educated and active consumer population that is not afraid to ask the right questions.", "The major changes contemplated in Bill 166 involve the regulation of travel agents and the powers granted to TICO, the regulator, to enforce regulations against those who carry out activities for which registration may be necessary. The PC caucus agrees with these changes, especially as far as they concern the activities of people holding themselves out as travel agents or as people able to arrange travel but lacking the proper guarantees to back up the consumer in the case of trouble.", "I need to point out, however, that an approach that paints everything as either black or white, combined with the lack of oversight over TICO, as is the case with other delegated authorities, may lead to some undesirable outcomes in cases where no wrongdoing or misrepresentation takes place.", "As an example, I will take a hypothetical, ordinary Ontarian who helps organize a school or church trip somewhere abroad. In doing so, they make the airline bookings for the group members, buy train tickets from a foreign provider, book hotels and reserve museum tickets. Then they collect the money from the participants and hand over the tickets and the booking confirmations. Is such a person considered to be carrying on a business? Are they a travel agent and therefore mandated to register with TICO, or are they just a local community member who knows how to arrange a one-off trip?", "The government is legitimately fulfilling its role as a steward of the public interest by creating the tools that are necessary for the regulator to enforce compliance. If there is no price for disobeying the rules, the rewards for doing so will attract the wrong people to the travel business. As TICO gains these new powers to levy administrative penalties and search non-registrant premises, they must keep in mind to exercise them with caution and with judgment.", "The Ontario PC caucus has consistently called for a greater scope for Ontarians and Ontario businesses to appeal delegated authority action and will continue doing so.", "The last component of Bill 166 repeals the existing Ticket Speculation Act and replaces it with the Ticket Sales Act. This move was prompted by the scandalous events surrounding the ticket sales at the last event by the Tragically Hip in Kingston, where tickets were sold out almost immediately then reappeared at inflated prices on resale platforms.", "Before delving into the Ticket Sales Act further, we should take a look at the rules of supply and demand that govern any kind of sale, including that of event tickets. Arguably, the only commodity that is not finite and has no delivery cost is the air we breathe. There is a set quantity of almost everything else at any given time or there is a cost to bring it to the end user, which means that it has an intrinsic price at which demand and supply would meet, making the market clear.", "Event tickets, especially those for popular performances or once-in-a-lifetime events such as the Tragically Hip concert in Kingston are at the far end of the spectrum because the demand from loyal fans far outstrips the venue’s capacity. In a perfectly free market, artists would set prices high enough to deter demand in excess of the overall event capacity. This approach would, however, shut out most budget-conscious fans from live concerts altogether. Current ticket sales practices seek to balance these competing needs, sometimes succeeding and sometimes failing.", "Reports for some events highlighted that only a fraction, sometimes less than a quarter, of overall tickets were put on sale to the general public while the remainder were distributed among sponsors, promoters and other presale avenues. This is not inherently negative, as it is the means by which, for instance, radio stations and other entertainment stakeholders obtain tickets to give away to listeners.", "The secondary resale market, which the Ticket Sales Act seeks to partially bring under control, exists principally to ensure that tickets that haven’t been distributed through presales or that are held by consumers no longer able to use them can be assigned to willing spectators. It is not designed for people to make a profit off selling tickets as if they were securities. We buy event tickets because we want to watch a show, not because we hope they will appreciate in value as the event draws nearer.", "At face value, then, the government’s initiative appears measured and fair. Capping the resale value of a ticket at no more than 150% of the original value removes most of the profit motive from event ticket buying. Economically, this hard cap will likely not deter high ticket resale prices, but instead divert these transactions to unregulated channels. People buy event tickets for resale because they know loyal fans are willing to pay a higher price than that charged at the source. In doing so, they are exploiting an economically inefficient price at the point of public sale for their own benefit, leaving artists and event organizers without the extra profits they could have reaped.", "While this discrepancy between public prices and market prices exists, the opportunity for individuals to sell at higher prices in an unregulated setting will continue to feed the black market.", "Bill 166’s provisions on ticket-buying software will ban the sale of and use of buying bots in Ontario. This is fine, as long as the user in question is in Ontario. In a global marketplace, where goods, services and money travel along fibre optic cables and the Internet, this kind of limitation is a band-aid solution at best. Whether it is a single user running a bot from abroad or a syndicate buying up tickets without bypassing anti-bot verification, those with a will to profit from the inflating ticket prices will find a way to bypass this legislation.", "What is the solution, then? We need a multi-pronged approach on the organizer, the distributor, the primary vendor and the secondary resale platform levels.", "Buying bulk and bulk resale for profit leaves traces such as credit card numbers in common; phone numbers in common; bank accounts in common; IP addresses and email addresses; short ticket holding times between purchase and resale; and large purchases for many events, maybe in different venues on the same day. These are all elements of intelligence gathering that can help stamp out bulk buying at the ordinary fan’s detriment; however, there is hardly a way for us to codify these strategies into law. It would be akin to fighting a hydra, with every prohibition spawning two ways around it. This is a fight for those who are directly involved in the creation, distribution, sale and resale of tickets to join and participate in concertedly. What they need from us is the assurance that whatever initiative they undertake to protect fans, we will have their backs.", "I just wanted, in the last minute, to talk about some of the things that I have seen over the past. I bought tickets to Adele last year. Of course, you’re looking for a website, and it went to theaircanadacentre.com website, only to find out that when you’re checking out, it’s an American price, and there’s a large delivery price from Chicago as well as administration. So there’s an example where you look at something like theaircanadacentre.com—you think it would be Canadian, but it’s not. Those are the types of tricks that happen. So we have to be able to work with consumers to educate them, and make some of the standard consumer options that are there—make sure that people understand them, know where to go and know where they’re secure." ],

I’m going to have an hour to talk about Tarion and the mess that’s been created over the last number of years on purchasing a home. We’ve all done it, by the way; we’ve all bought our first home, and we’re all excited—our family is excited; the community is excited—to finally purchase a home, even though the bank really owns it for about 30 or 35 years, but that’s a whole other story. But at the end of the day, you’re excited. Then you move into your new home, and you have nothing but problems over a period of time, and it takes all that excitement away. Then you go to Tarion, who is supposed to help you, and they don’t help you. They fight you every step of the way to make the claims. I’m going to elaborate on that over the course of my hour.", "Today I’m going to talk about tickets, which he raised. When I began my speech earlier this week, I used an example that has been in the media quite a bit: the Tragically Hip farewell tour and the cost of those tickets. As you know, Madam Speaker, the news yesterday of Gord Downie passing broke the hearts of Canadians from coast to coast to coast. I’ll continue on that topic when I get a chance later. But I want to avoid the example, because what Gord Downie offered this country since his terrible diagnosis is beyond politics. He offered us hope and unity, and the idea that we could work together for something bigger than ourselves. His music inspired millions, but his social justice work was just as powerful. He taught us that it’s never too late to care for our neighbours and to make the world a better place.", "Let me close by saying: Thanks, Gord, and to the Tragically Hip and their fans.

I associate my remarks with the member for Niagara Falls about Gord Downie and the profound effect he had on our nation and how sad our nation is, as a whole, at his passing. We all recall the furor, justifiably so, that surrounded his final tour and the opportunity to get tickets for that, how these bots were able to take the tickets away from everybody else and then resell them at a rate that was outrageous, to say the least.", "We believe fans come first. For instance, that’s why we’re going to change the rules so fans in Ontario have what we would refer to as a real fair shot at getting the tickets they want while making sure ticket prices are affordable and transparent. The member was making reference to that.", "We used the input and advice of over 34,000 fans and dozens of entertainment industry representatives to do a lot of proposed changes to Ontario’s ticket laws that would make buying tickets fair and more transparent to consumers. People in the Niagara region will know, for instance, the Meridian Centre. Elton John is coming to St. Catharines, which is a very big deal for a community of our size. Elton John tends to go to these kinds of communities. Immediately, it was impossible to get tickets because the bots had bought them up. Using special techniques electronically the bots had purchased all these tickets and then were selling them at outrageous rates. We think this is very important. It’s contained in the bill, which is very comprehensive." ],

That particular approach has been implemented with success in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan, so I see that to be an oversight going forward.", "Having said that, we’re pleased to see that the new authorities will have Auditor General oversight and a mandatory internal ombudsman. Equally pleasing is that provisions easing the onus of proof currently imposed on homeowners will help consumers initiate claims and resolve them in a more cost-effective way than is done today.", "I wanted to turn, with the remaining time I have, Speaker, to real estate particularly and indicate that we support the additional disclosure requirements for realtors and brokerages. We welcome that in the spirit of openness and transparency.

There is some argument that because it was built off-site a lot of the warranty and building codes—who enforces the building codes in those cases? Really, the argument shouldn’t be, who enforces the Ontario building code? It really should come down to protection for the homeowner. We see with existing issues with Tarion, those are not looked after today. So you’ve got a couple who is afraid to say anything. They may have to try to sell their home.

But if we approach those questions with empathy and an open mind, I know that we can get it right. That is what we have done through our history, and that is what we should do going forward." ],

The law brought in by the Liberal government in Quebec has no place in Ontario. Indeed, it has no place in Canada. My leader has often said it doesn’t matter who you are, it doesn’t matter where you’re from, it doesn’t matter who you love, it doesn’t matter how much you make, and it doesn’t matter where you worship; you have a home here, in the province of Ontario, and we respect you. All Canadians have a legal right to their religious beliefs, including in the province of Quebec.", "I would be a hypocrite if I stood here in this place today to not support this motion. Speaker, you’ll recall there was a time in our history, in this assembly, where we thought about removing the Lord’s Prayer. I was a young MPP at the time—it was about 11 years ago—and I fought vigorously for the right to defend the Lord’s Prayer in this place. It was a time when my father was dying, and sometimes the only way I was able to get faith was to come in here and have half a minute to reflect.", "I was really pleased that we came as an assembly to come together and not remove the Lord’s Prayer, but to look around this assembly and understand that there are people of different faiths, whether that’s Jewish or Hindu or Buddhist or others, and we were able to incorporate something that was inclusive, not exclusive. I think that’s the Canadian spirit, and that’s why I’m proud of this assembly. Whether you wear a cross, a turban, a hijab, a kippah or any other religious symbol, you should never be denied any public service in the province of Ontario or anywhere else in Canada.", "The Canada I grew up in—I’ve always said it—was not diverse at all. I grew up in a small town called New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. But one of the greatest things that I have had to live in my life is to come here—to see the diversity in the city of Ottawa; in the riding I represent, Nepean–Carleton; and here in the most diverse city in the world, Toronto. There is no place for two-tiered citizenship in Canada, and as members of this assembly, we must always stand against that.", "I’ll leave on this point: The expression of freedom is never strengthened when we try to limit it in others. Therefore, I continue to oppose this bill. I would also ask that our government seek leave to intervene in any charter challenge on the constitutionality of this bill.

  "text" : [ "Some people have asked me: How did you get into this issue of life insurance and life settlements? I said that I blame it on one of my constituents, who is here with me today: Morris Adams. It’s his fault. Morris came to my office a couple of times and tried to explain a problem that he had. His problem was one of trying to take care of Ruth, his wife of 67 years, whom he takes care of diligently at home at Two Neptune Drive, up on Bathurst Street.", "Morris is still working as a chartered accountant—he still works. He has had a distinguished career, and again, he has saved his money his whole life and tried to do the best he could by his family. Now he’s at a point in his life—Morris reminds me he’s 91 years old. The trouble is that he is insurance-rich and cash-poor. He is running out of his savings because of the cost of taking care of his wife at home. He brings in a homemaker to try to help out. He has got to pay his living accommodations still at Two Neptune. Despite lifelong work and saving—an excellent citizen—he is having a great deal of difficulty financially at this stage of life.", "So he said that he approached his insurance company and said, “Listen, I’ve got”—I think—“about $300,000 worth of life insurance policies. Can I get any value out of them so I can get some money to help support my wife and myself?” I think the life insurance company’s response was, “Not while you’re alive; you can’t get any money. Now, if you die, you will get some money for your beneficiaries.” Morris said, “Listen, I want to take care of my wife now and I don’t look forward to dying. I want to live,” and take care of his wife, Ruth.", "That’s how I got involved in this whole issue of life settlements.", "I don’t know if anybody here—Mr. Bailey, from Sarnia, have you ever looked at your life insurance policy? Have you ever seen the print, the different options and different types? There must be about 50 different types of life insurance. Have you really looked at what they really mean and what you can do and cannot do and what the pros and cons are of the type of life insurance you have, term insurance or universal insurance? Anyway, it is really complex.", "What this bill tries to do is it tries to give people an extra option when they get a life insurance policy, and the option is this: If you come to a point in your life where you want to sell your life insurance policy and get some money that you need now to take care of yourself or your wife or your family, that you have that option in the life insurance policy. That’s what life settlements are: that you’re given that choice. Now, you don’t have that choice in Ontario. In 42 US states, they have it. Life settlements: You’ve got that choice. It’s been since 1994. In a number of Canadian provinces—Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia etc.—they have that option. Here in Ontario, for 80 years there has been a law on the books that denies seniors the right to that option.", "We know what happens to your life insurance policy now. If you read the fine print in your life insurance policy, it tells you that you’ve got two options. In Mr. Morris’s case, for instance—do you know what your two options are? One thing the insurance company will tell you is to just walk away from it and let it lapse. Even though you’ve paid premiums for 30 or 40 years into a life insurance policy—thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars maybe—you get zero out of that life insurance policy. You walk away from it. In fact, that’s what happens to most life insurance policies. People walk away from it because they can’t continue to afford the premiums.", "The other thing you can do is you can surrender the life insurance policy—that is, give it up. But you can only give it up to the insurance company you bought it from. And you know what you get back for it? Look at the fine print. My friend from Windsor, the fine print will tell you that you can only give it back to the insurance company that sold it to you, and you know what you get back for it? You’re lucky if you get 3%, 4% or 5% back.", "So here you are, you’ve bought this life insurance, you dutifully paid premiums, and you can’t access that cash.", "In this bill here, we’re asking for a choice to be made whereby you can have the option of selling it to a third party. There are markets that will buy these life insurance policies and they continue paying the premiums for you, but they’ll give you a value—50% of the value, 60% of the value, depending on what the market is for it. But at least you have some value that you choose to get out of that life insurance policy, rather than all those premiums and all that money ending up with zero cash in your pocket. That is what this bill is trying to do—it’s trying to say that seniors, especially, should have a choice at a point in their life of what they want to do with their life insurance policy.", "Some people say, “The government has the right to deny you this right.” Well, I think we underestimate the intelligence, the capacity, of 99% of our seniors. They have the intelligence to make these choices. The bill even calls for a 10-day cooling-off period so that they can re-evaluate, because life insurance is a very complex field.", "There are thousands of seniors who, through their quality of life and their hard work and their good habits, are living much longer in Ontario and throughout Canada and North America. Now it’s very common for our seniors to live to 80, 90 or 100. They’re living longer and longer. The tragedy is, as they live longer and longer—as Morris told me, “My biggest fear is that I’m going to run out of money. I’m running out.” If you’re living, as Morris is, here in the middle of Toronto—and he’s taking care of his wife; he’s still working. He said, “Mike, I’m running out of money. I’ve tried to get my life insurance to give me some money. There’s no go.”", "It’s a real thing that isn’t for every senior; it isn’t for every family. But it’s a choice that I hope, as legislators, we can give to our senior citizens. It is a viable option. Again, it has been on the books in the United States, and it is in most provinces. But it is not one that is supported by the life insurance association of Canada. They don’t like it.", "I think that we owe it to the people of Ontario to look at how life insurance works, to make it more transparent. Does life insurance really work for the benefit of seniors? Are they getting good value for their life insurance? Does it give seniors and Ontarians in general—those of us who pay for life insurance for years and years—the transparency we need? Is the life insurance policy in understandable, Canadian Tire English? I doubt it. You probably have to be a Bay Street lawyer to read a life insurance policy. I haven’t read mine. In fact, because of this I’m going to go back and read mine to see what the heck it means and if I’ve got anything.", "I think it’s a very good opportunity, as we look at life settlements, that maybe, beyond this bill, this Legislature could also start to open up the curtains behind this mysterious world of life insurance.", "I’m not trying to demonize the life insurance companies or the people who sell life insurance. What I’m trying to say is that we need to make it more transparent, more understandable, more consumer-friendly and more beneficial to the consumer. It seems to me, in this area of life settlements, most of the benefits go to the life insurance companies. Sure, there are many people who benefit by life insurance payouts and benefits. But we still need to find options that make life insurance much more to the benefit of the person who, in good faith, has paid premiums year after year, decade after decade, and now, at a time when they want to make a choice, as in Mr. Adams’s case—the choice is that he wants to keep on living in dignity, taking care of his wife and keeping up a reasonable standard of living by accessing policies that he’s paid for. Year after year, he’s paid thousands and thousands of dollars in premiums, so he has done his part. Now he’s saying, “Why can’t I access these policies?” which belong to him; they’re his assets. He cannot do it in Ontario.", "The interesting thing is that this same bill was put into legislation in the year 2000 as a result of the Red Tape Commission. It recommended that this be given in Ontario. Sadly, in the year 2000, this bill died; it never got proclaimed. I’m hoping that we will look at this, debate it and find out if we cannot, as a provincial Legislature, take this bold step and give our hard-working life-long good citizens—especially our seniors—the choice of accessing money from their life insurance policy in a free and open market. Right now, as I said, you cannot access that in Ontario. The doors are closed." ],

Life settlements, as this is known, involve the disposition by the insured of their insurance policy and it involves the disposition of all of their rights under a life insurance policy to a third party in exchange for a cash payment. That means: “I’m 20 years old. I buy a life insurance policy. I’ve paid into it. I’m 40 years old. I can stop paying today; it’s got a value, a $100,000 policy. Today, I would look to have the opportunity to sell it and have that money today because my family is taken care of by other areas of my financial plan.” That’s really what it comes down to.", "In Canada, there are four provinces that do not allow this; in fact, they explicitly prohibit this: Saskatchewan, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Brunswick. I’m sorry; those are the four provinces that allow it. All of the other provinces, including Ontario, prohibit trafficking, as they call it, of insurance policies.", "Bill 162, An Act to amend the Insurance Act to authorize life settlements, proposes amendments to section 115 of the Insurance Act to allow an exception to that current rule. It allows people to be able to sell their insurance policy. Right now the prohibition does not apply to the sale of a life insurance policy if the purchase is from the original policyholder and the policy has been held for at least 36 months. In reality, it probably would have to be held for a lot longer than that to have the cash value paid up. You’re not going to want to buy an insurance policy from somebody that they still owe a tremendous amount of money on. There are going to be certain restrictions and certain guidelines.", "Consumers deserve to have a choice. When it comes to their insurance options, as in everything else in Ontario, they should be able to have a choice. There are some who wrote to me who say that this is dangerous and opens up a potentially predatory market; there are those. There are many on the flip side—especially seniors—who know that some of the protections can be looked at here and believe that this should be allowed. They compare it, quite frankly, to the reverse mortgage. We hear a lot of comparisons to the reverse mortgage, which is really geared towards seniors, and it is a generally accepted financing tool—it’s a financing option, again.", "I know that there are professional organizations that people with this colour of hair tend to be a member of. I agree with what they’re suggesting, which is to get this thing to committee so we can talk about it intelligently. I think that’s really where we want to go. There are some red flags to opening the door for unscrupulous opportunists, but there are huge and wonderful advantages for seniors to be able to capitalize on the money that they invested in their security when that security, for whatever reason, is no longer necessary." ],

Speaker, this is an interesting one because, as the member from Eglinton–Lawrence had said, when it comes to insurance, it may not be in Canadian Tire English, or that you might have to read the fine print a couple of times. I did my darnedest to wrap my head around this particular bill, this particular issue, and I’m glad I took the time because I find it not just an interesting topic for conversation; I find it alarming, frankly. I would also like to welcome his constituent, Morris, here to Queen’s Park.", "I’m glad to know that constituents find their way into all offices and bring their issues forward. My grandma is 96, and I know how challenging it is for her to make ends meet and figure out the cost of care and accommodations and all of those stresses that she endures living in this province.", "What we have here, as I understand it, is that if I were to have a life insurance policy—and when I take that out initially, there are choices at the beginning and I can hopefully work with the company and figure out the right policy for me. Whether that’s to cover university for my dependents, whether that is to cover a mortgage or funeral expenses or what have you, there are different options as you’re getting into this—and fine print, as we have heard.", "I would like to say that what the member opposite said about making it more transparent and looking at the entire beast of life insurance and saying, “Let’s make sure that the folks in Ontario are getting what they should have and understanding what they’re getting into,” and to give them flexibility of products and coverage: All of those things are super-important. A lot of constituents come into my office and, whether it’s about home insurance or car insurance or insurance in general, there are so many concerns about the system. I wish that the government would be up to the task of holding the industry accountable in more ways—but that’s a different conversation, I think.", "What we have here is that if I buy a policy and then I get down the road and I say, “I would like”—as he said—“the flexibility to get some money out of this while I’m still alive,” then we get into the secondary market. This is saying that there would be a third party. Perhaps my friend over here, my colleague next to me, says, “Well, I’ll buy it from you. I’ll pay you more than it’s worth right now, but it’s not nearly as much as it’s going to be worth when you die.” That happens, I continue on my merry way, and whatnot.", "What if I’ve got dependents, and what about my funeral expenses, and what about what comes next that that policy would have covered? I’m not insurable anymore, is my understanding. Let’s say that I have dependents, Madam Speaker. Let’s say that I have a family and let’s say that I need that money. I’m not a senior, by the way. The feeling of, “Let’s look after our seniors”: I understand that, but this isn’t specific to seniors. This is anybody with a policy.", "Now if I’m a parent and I’ve got a number of children and maybe I have addiction issues or perhaps I have a gambling challenge—what if I’m desperate and I need that money? I need that money, so I work out that same deal with the guy who is waiting outside of the casino who says, “I’ve got some papers for you to sign.” What happens then? I’m not insurable again, and that money is gone. The benefits are gone, that safety net for dependents, for beneficiaries, for maybe university expenses, for mortgage—it’s gone.", "What I find in my constituency office is that a lot of folks that come in are desperate, they are oftentimes in crisis and they are absolutely up against it. They are up against it when it comes to the cost of accommodations, and I see nothing from this government about incentivizing the development world to actually get into affordable housing again. I don’t see a plan to make housing more affordable. I certainly don’t see a plan to lower bills. “Let’s sell off Hydro One and cut off all of our revenue streams and not have as much money to put into education and health care. Let’s actually not make medicine more affordable for people who are over 24.”", "So if we’re going to talk about giving people options, let’s give them options across the board. Let’s make life a little bit more affordable. In fact, let’s not even make it a little more affordable; let’s make it affordable entirely. Let’s look at the whole thing. Let’s give people options all along the way so that we don’t force them into counting the pennies at the end of life and saying, “Oh, my gosh, I cannot pay for things. I cannot look after the people I love. I cannot get to the end of this.” I know how challenging it is for people because we meet with them every day.", "This is something that FSCO is against. This is a bill that this member has put forward, saying, “FSCO will regulate it.” Well, FSCO is saying, “This isn’t a good idea.”", "At what point do we look at our responsibility to community members along their entire lifetime? Someone who works their whole life and is paying in should be able to have security all the way through.", "Lord knows, I’ve spent hours and hours and hours debating with this government on retirement security, with their Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.

People down in the US, in many, many states, have this opportunity as well. So from a perspective of fairness, we need to open up these avenues. Ontario shouldn’t be known as a disadvantaged province where seniors don’t have an opportunity to access life leases.", "I also want to address the question that, if consumers knew that this was a possibility and they spend all those years putting money into premiums, as I have, into life insurance policies—if they knew that this was a possibility when their cash flow might run short later in life, they may be more inclined to not put that money into a savings account but to be able to have the insurance, in case of a catastrophic event in their life, that would provide money for their families.", "So I think an unintended consequence—or maybe intended, because the member from Eglinton–Lawrence is so complex—it may be an intended consequence that this will encourage younger people to take out life insurance policies, which would be much needed to protect their own families. I think that could be a very important benefit of doing this.", "If you look at the provinces like Quebec, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia: They have this opportunity. So I think it’s important that we recognize that and that we take an opportunity to bring this kind of legislation to Ontario.", "It’s interesting that in my bill later on I’ll be talking about the fairness question as well—the lack of fairness has to do with a private corporation—Equifax, TransUnion—who don’t give us the same benefits, and I’ll talk about this.

That’s borne out by statistics that are available through the Ontario Ministry of Finance, which tells us that the number of seniors aged 65 and over is projected to almost double, from 2.3 million to 4.6 million, by the year 2041.", "Coupled with this projection, many seniors in Ontario continue to find themselves in dire financial situations. These circumstances often mitigate the importance of having a life insurance policy, in lieu of greater access to other forms of financial assistance. It’s clear that financial options for seniors, such as life settlements, have become increasingly necessary as Ontario seniors continue to pay more and get less.", "Speaker, if the primary purpose of Bill 162 is to propose ways to assist seniors financially, then the Liberal government should also consider options to make their lives, overall, more affordable.", "On the merits of the content of the legislation: I would urge the government to undertake a robust consultation on the content of this legislation; in particular, with the Ontario Ministry of Seniors Affairs Liaison Committee. This committee is comprised of 20 organizations with the leadership, knowledge and expertise related to seniors’ issues; in particular, life settlements. The committee’s voice would be valuable, I would suggest, to include in these consultations, as well as a cross-section of life and health insurance providers.", "There needs to be some assurance that seniors will not be asked to surrender policies without fully understanding the consequences. At the same time, there should be measures in place to educate consumers on the details of these transactions, and that life settlements can represent a way to access funds out of a lifetime investment that they would not be able to access otherwise.", "In closing, Speaker, I’m a strong believer in providing residents with the freedom to do what’s right for them, and that government should have a smaller role in the lives of Ontarians. At the end of the day, Bill 162 is about enhancing the quality of life and supporting the needs of seniors who have built our communities here in the province of Ontario.

I disagree with his approach, but I know his heart is in the right place.", "This bill is being portrayed as a measure to alleviate poverty for those with life insurance. However, it would hurt many Ontarians in the long run. The basic premise of this legislation is to permit individuals to cash in their life insurance plans early so that they can use the money to get out of immediate debt. This would create a secondary market for life insurance products. It may sound practical to permit someone to sell off their life insurance early; however, the effects of the idea would be harmful.", "Life insurance is an important investment that many Ontarians make. There are different options. An individual can pay into a plan that will usually either provide protection over a long period of time or give a large payout upon an individual’s death. In cases where the individual may choose to sell off their life insurance plan, these future payouts would be compromised. When somebody invests in a life insurance plan, their long-term intention is not to eventually sell it off. Selling off their life insurance plan would only be taken as a desperate measure and a last resort. Essentially, the individual is favouring a short-term gain for long-term pain. That is because the amounts they could earn through the sale are much lower than what the plan is capable of giving them back in the end.", "Not only does the legislation have the potential to compromise the future of impoverished Ontarians; it could also lead to the creation of a predatory market environment. This is what’s happening in the United States. At this very moment, there are American laws that give an insurance policyholder the ability to sell their plan. The purchaser becomes the new beneficiary of a payout when the insurance policyholder dies or reaches a certain age. In almost all of these cases in the US, the new beneficiaries are large institutions. In his article from the Wall Street Journal in 2004, Jeff D. Opdyke suggested that this market wasn’t necessarily consumer-friendly. He warned readers to prepare for phone calls from individuals called “insurance agents” asking to buy off the reader’s life insurance plan. His recommendation was to try and avoid selling their plans. This article gives an informative look at the real problems of this practice. However, it is doubtful that every insurance policyholder will understand the problems with what they are doing at the time. They may need rent now and hear a voice on the other end of the telephone line telling them that they are able to collect big bucks to cover their debts. But in that interaction, the longer-term implications would not be explained to the insurance policyholder.", "In Money magazine, Dan Kadlec gave a generic overview of what might happen to an insurance policyholder who chooses to sell their plan. If they are insured for, say, $1 million, they might receive $250,000 from the purchaser. Upon their death, the purchaser would receive $1 million and the seller would receive nothing. Basically, the family of the seller would be shortchanged $750,000. This is not an outcome that helps to solve poverty; it only makes things worse for our next generation.", "By implementing Bill 162, we do not just give individuals the capacity to sell off their life insurance plans; we open the floodgates for a predatory market that would be designed to take advantage of average Ontarians. This bill is trying to address the issue of poverty in the wrong way.", "Looking at Bill 162, I can’t help but think that the Liberals are truly legislative magicians: They have you focus on one hand, and they deceive you with the other. The question that they want you to be asking yourself is, “Why shouldn’t individuals have the freedom to sell off their insurance?” All the while, they are distracting you from the real question: “Why do individuals find themselves in such extreme debt, to the point where they feel the need to sell off their life insurance plans to survive?”", "Here is the problem right now in this province: Social assistance rates are simply too low for most people to live off of. They have been well below an adequate amount since the early days of Mike Harris, and the government since that time has done nothing meaningful to change it. Debt for the average person below or close to the poverty line piles up and piles up and piles up. Thus, for Ontarians with few assets built up, selling off an asset like life insurance could be a tempting option. If this Liberal government is really committed to helping Ontarians get out of a financial bind, give them the social assistance to do so.", "One thing you could do is move Bill 6 forward, which I brought forward, which is lying dormant in level 2. This bill creates a commission to make recommendations on what social insurance rates should be in each region of the province. That would help to alleviate poverty.", "But don’t legalize an option that could drastically cost average Ontarians in the long run much more than they invested initially and what the people who bought their plan would earn.", "For some reason, this government has a problem investing in social assistance programs, but I’ve got an idea for them: They need to think about social assistance rates not as a cost but as political insurance. You should be paying into this insurance program right now. That way, when your party is kicked out of office, you can point back to your time here and say, “Look, we improved social assistance rates. We moved forward with Bill 6 to help people.” The more you pay in, the less you’ll be hated once you’re kicked out.", "Bill 162 is addressing a significant problem in the wrong way. Our Legislature needs to take a good, hard look at this province. It needs to recognize the harsh reality that poverty is widespread, and take action in the form of more adequate social insurance rates, for the good of this province." ],

I applaud his effort to seek creative solutions to improve their quality of life.", "I also want to take a moment to welcome Mr. Morris, who I happened to run into—literally ran into—when he was walking into Queen’s Park earlier.", "Section 115 of the Ontario Insurance Act came into effect in the early part of the 20th century, and in that time, much has changed. I think it is important now to analyze whether this act adequately reflects the values, trends and needs of our society today. As many members have already pointed out, seniors are our fastest-growing demographic. One of the issues, really, is that we are living so much longer than we were living even 50 years ago that there is a real concern around whether people will outlive their savings.", "When you look at the demographic changes, I think it’s really important for us to look at all of the possible solutions. The NDP has proposed some solutions, and I’m not saying no to them, but that should not preclude us from looking at other solutions. This is one such solution.", "The challenge here, really, is a tension between the desire to protect consumers and to allow liquidity in an instrument. It’s really that tension between free markets and consumer protection. I think the sweet spot lies somewhere in the middle.", "I did find some of the comments by the members from the third party a little concerning because they almost don’t trust Ontarians to know what is good for them. On the other hand, there are some real concerns around consumer protection.", "A couple of things that I just wanted to raise were that I liked the fact that the member has put in a 10-day cooling-off period. That’s critical. That’s really important. But before we go ahead, while I like the concept, I think we need to consult more. We need to consult with our seniors as well. The reason I say that is that one of the unintended consequences of allowing for life settlements could be that insurance premiums go up for life insurance. We just want to make sure that we know about that and what that impact would be. So stakeholder consultations would be really important. The idea and the intent are really strong, but the devil is always in the details.", "I think a few members made mention of the fact that Quebec is among those provinces that allows for the sale of life insurance in the secondary market. It’s instructive for us to know that now Quebec is moving to put some limitations on those sales. It’s not saying that you can’t sell, but it’s trying to put some limitations—again, in recognition of the fact of that tension between consumer protection and allowing individuals that flexibility with the financial assets that they have.", "The last thing that I would say is that education is a really important piece in this. If you’re unable to pay your insurance premiums, it’s really important to know that, at that point, the cash value of your insurance will actually be used by the insurance companies to pay that premium so that your insurance doesn’t lapse, and indeed, when the time comes, that insurance payment is made. And it’s really important for individuals to know what the cash value of their life insurance is so that they never sell—if we allow them to sell, the important thing is that we make sure that there is a mechanism so that nobody ever sells their life insurance below that cash value, because at that point they are really hurting themselves.", "I think in summary I would say that I want to thank the member. It’s an innovative idea. I want to just caution that we need to do a lot of stakeholder consultations, including with senior stakeholders, and make sure there aren’t any unintended consequences that we didn’t mean to happen." ],

In the United States, it’s fairly common. In fact, it’s called life settlement, and it’s estimated that more than $7 million is paid to people there every day through these life settlements.", "The idea is that whoever buys it continues to pay the premiums and gets a payout at the end while the original policyholder may benefit by getting some portion of the money while they are alive instead of the full amount going to their beneficiaries when dead.", "Madam Speaker, I support that. It’s about choice. I bought the policy, I want to be able to do it, and I should, I believe, utilize that asset if it’s my choosing. It appears to be a choice often pursued by senior citizens who are struggling financially in retirement. Today, as we know, in Ontario, we have a lot of senior citizens who fit this vulnerable profile because this Liberal government has made their life harder, sadly. This doesn’t mean they’re living in poverty, but they are in a very vulnerable economic situation in many cases and could be one bad Liberal policy away from poverty.", "Considering the recent trends in Ontario—namely, the rising cost of living expenses, lack of affordable housing, hydro and drug hikes, and poor access to nursing care beds—this government has really made it unmanageable for seniors to keep up with the cost of those essentials. So this is one tool, one resource, that they could actually go to to make life more comfortable while they’re living. I believe, again, that that’s what we need to be looking at. None of us wants to see senior citizens living in poverty, but again, the recent government policies have made Ontario seniors more vulnerable.", "If it’s not falling on family to help reduce their parents’ financial stress—in fact, more than three million Ontarians are doing that today for their aging parents, and 70% say they themselves are struggling to financially support their elderly parents’ needs—then what do you do? The member for Eglinton–Lawrence says, “Sell your life insurance policy,” and I commend him for bringing this forward for debate.", "I can support this bill on the merit that it offers consumer choice, but I respectfully remind the member, his Premier and the government that to truly help seniors with their income, they should instead make the drug system better and cheaper by reducing red tape, and make life overall more affordable through tax cuts and lower hydro bills, as well as increasing access to seniors’ housing and nursing beds.", "Affordability is the most common theme I hear when I am speaking with senior citizens and stakeholders, including the Retired Teachers of Ontario, the Ontario Association of Non-Profit Homes and Services for Seniors, the Ontario Community Support Association and the United Senior Citizens of Ontario.", "If the Liberals are likely considering Bill 162 because they have raised the cost of living dramatically and expect seniors to sell their life insurance to pay for their hydro bill, then that’s a scary thought. I know that the stakeholders I mentioned would not want to see that happen, and neither would they want to see seniors exposed to a potentially predatory market that may result from this proposed amendment. There are a number of red flags when it comes to opening the door for unscrupulous opportunists to take advantage of vulnerable seniors, and I did raise these concerns with Mr. Leonard Goodman, who is in the audience today, of the Life Insurance Settlement Association of Canada.", "It is clear that this government has made life for our most vulnerable seniors unmanageable, completely neglecting to ensure they have an opportunity to enjoy a dignified and safe quality of life at retirement. Let’s not forget that 30,000 of them are stuck on the province’s long-term-care wait-list, a wait-list that is expected to double to 50,000 seniors in five years, as this Liberal government refuses to commit to increasing capacity and adding new nursing beds.", "Madam Speaker, as I summarize, I believe seniors deserve better than they are getting from this current government, and this is a tool that, for many, could actually open a door to allow them to live comfortably and in the manner that they choose. It is something that, certainly, I believe gives choice. I believe there have to be safeguards. That’s why, if we get it to committee, we can have those types of concerns raised. We did have a group, the CLHIA, that has brought in some concerns, and again, that should all be discussed at committee so that we know that. But I believe with proper safeguards, such as a 10-day cooling-off and a rule that you can’t flip and flip and flip a policy, that there’s a one-time consideration—when I had that meeting with Mr. Goodman.", "Again, it comes back to choice. This is an asset—and many people’s lives change. They bought life insurance for one need, perhaps that has changed, and they have that sitting there as an asset. I think the key point here is that if they choose and there are safeguards so that they know exactly what they’re doing, then I believe it comes back to the fundamental right for them to be able to make that decision. If there are good safeguards, if there’s good regulation in place to make sure that that is there and it’s clear, then I believe, at the end of the day, we need people to allow people to make decisions that are going to be about their life on their own behalf. I stand behind that principle that we shouldn’t be interfering. This is old, archaic legislation that we can change to make lives better, particularly for the seniors of our province and those who wish to do so." ],

That’s very consistent with other legislation we have in our province to protect consumers, that cooling-off period. So people can make an informed choice, maybe go get some legal advice or talk to family and friends and see if this is the right thing for them to do.", "I know that when my dad lost his wife—my stepmom—fairly suddenly a couple of years ago, he felt very pressured financially.

It is about seniors or anyone else who needs to live and age comfortably and with dignity. I think choice is important. I know for Dad it was a very panicky situation. In the middle of his grief, he was feeling the need to sell his house and do some other things so he would have better cash flow. Well, that may not have been the best decision for Dad at the time.", "I think this bill brings forward something that I feel strongly about, and that’s the principle of consumer choice.

The money goes back to your insurance company friends. It doesn’t go to the seniors. Why you would be in favour of that as the NDP is beyond me. Sorry for that.", "But anyway, I just want to say that this is something I had hoped to do, to try and open up this very cloudy, mysterious world of life insurance that needs some transparency. It needs some consumer protection. It needs to look at different options. This is one option I’ve put forward, just as I put the option forward about the innocent co-insured, where we would found out there was a loophole. The NDP supported that too, where if you are co-insured—and in the case of those three sad situations, where three women had their houses burned down by the criminal acts of their husbands, they didn’t get any money from the insurance company when their houses burned down; three cases that I know of where that happened.

The purpose of the Air Miles bill was to not allow loyalty points, reward points, to expire on the basis of time alone. It was a period when Air Miles, at the time, was looking to expire all their points on December 31, and because we brought forward this bill and put uncertainty into the community about this, they withdrew.", "In all three cases, the bills were passed or acted upon by our government. Here is a fourth bill. I absolutely believe this bill deserves the full support of this House and our government to move it forward, because it is, again, a very important consumer protection bill.", "If passed, the bill will do four things. First off, it will force credit-reporting agencies to provide up to five free credit reports every year, if a consumer should ask for them. They can also ask for them in any form that they want to receive them, be it by mail or electronically. That’s an important consideration. I will return to it later.", "It also will allow a consumer to request of a credit-reporting agency that they put a security freeze on their personal credit report. I will explain it again in more detail, but having a freeze means that no financial institution will ever advance credit against that consumer if there is a freeze on their report.", "It will commit credit-reporting agencies to have timely responses to consumer concerns, both in getting immediately back to them, within two days, and resolving a complaint within 15 days.", "Then, finally, the last thing that this bill will do is it will provide free credit monitoring and fraud alert services up to the year 2021 for all Ontarians who request it.", "I find it a bit rich that these credit agencies in Ontario—Equifax and TransUnion primarily—are collecting all of your private information, all of the transactions that you do and all of your relationships with banks, credit card companies and major department stores. They are collecting all of that information without talking to you about it; they are simply collecting it. Then they are selling that information to a third party: back to the banks, back to the credit card providers—again, with no notification to you. And so, unless you ask for it, you have no idea what information they are sharing. You are allowed to ask for it, but if you want that information in a timely manner, they charge you for it. They are required by law to give it to you if you ask, but they will give it to you in writing, and that sometimes takes a long time and doesn’t serve the purpose required. So I think it’s really important that we stand up to these big credit agencies and say, “You know what? This is personal data. You have an obligation to the people whose data you are collecting to treat them in a respectful manner.”", "The timeliness of this bill is also very important. Speaker, you’ll be aware that there was a major breach of personal data leaked from Equifax in the US that affected 100,000 Canadians. The timeliness of the response of Equifax—it was as if they were more interested in getting their public relations in line before they were interested in notifying people of these potential breaches. In fact, there is an allegation out there that some of the executives sold shares in their own company after the time that the corporation knew about the breach, although the claim is—in their defence, they say that they didn’t know anything about it at the time.", "So I think it’s really important that we take a look at this bill and we take an opportunity to stand up to these credit agencies.", "The first thing, as I said, is that it talks about free credit reports: five in a year. And don’t use snail mail: In the electronic age, it is very easy for them to push a button with your email account and give you back the report that you want as soon as you want it. There are some who think that you should be able to get as many reports as you want in a year, since it is your information, but I think, out of reasonableness, we’re suggesting five in a year. How often are you going to really need to go back to that well to find out what your credit score is and take steps to improve it? So I believe that five a year—and using whatever technology you want—they should be able to respond to it.", "Secondly, a freeze of credit: A security freeze of your credit is extremely important to protect against identity theft and fraudulent operators, under your name, getting credit and spending it on your behalf. It often happens, and has happened to friends of mine—it has happened to previous members of this House. An individual has gotten hold of their personal information, gone to a big-box store—Leon’s, a “don’t pay a cent for a year” event—and using that information, they’ve gotten Equifax or TransUnion to say, “Yes, this person has a good credit rating.” And this person who has fraudulently stolen the identity gets a credit card for that department store or for that big-box store, runs up a bill of $10,000 or $20,000 in equipment, and a year goes by before they are in breach of not paying it back. By that time, there is no security video evidence of who made that purchase. And now the big-box store comes back to the consumer whose identity was stolen to fraudulently obtain that credit, and says, “You owe us $10,000 for that equipment.” “I didn’t buy that equipment.” “How do you prove it? It was done with your credit card.” So by having a security freeze on people’s credit, it means that no institution will give credit to somebody, because there’s a freeze.", "Now, Speaker, you ask: “Well, what if I do need to go back to the bank and get another credit card, or get a loan, or get a mortgage?” We’re going to make sure, under this act, that within 48 hours you can lift that freeze, and that you can lift it and put it on at least twice a year. I think that gives consumers the flexibility they need in order to protect themselves against fraud and to manage their finances appropriately.", "The third thing the bill does, as I say, is timely response. I have heard from so many people about the difficulty they have in resolving a credit score problem with an agency. They don’t get back to them. They don’t get back to them electronically, and it takes weeks and months to get a response. So the bill is going to make two specific requirements of a credit-reporting agency: First off, they will have to respond in two days to a consumer’s concern; and then it puts in a further obligation that they will have up to 15 days to resolve the complaint. I think that should be enough time for them to get back with a specific resolution, and if it’s not satisfactory, well, there are other avenues that individuals can take up, to take on a credit report if they don’t believe the information is there.", "Finally, I want to talk about this free credit monitoring. Equifax and TransUnion make money from you going and spending money to get not just your credit report but to get a fraud and monitoring alert service—I think it’s upwards of $35. You put that on; you pay for it. If someone comes in, they will notify you that someone is asking for credit, and then you can respond, “Well, that’s not me,” and they won’t get it. In the US, when the breach happened, they offered all Americans one year of free access to reports and, up to—I think—November 21, a freeze on their credit report. That’s just not good enough.", "What I’m saying in this bill is, up until 2021, the end of year 2020, because so much data has been breached and there is a real risk to people, they have to do credit monitoring until the end of 2020, so they will let you know if anybody is trying to access an account that is not yours or access opportunities to get financing for information that is not yours.", "As I said at the beginning, this goes to the heart of consumer protection. It is something that I’ve made, on behalf of my representation of the good people of Beaches–East York and of the province of Ontario, a priority. I think it’s really important that not only do we do the general business of the House here, but we do all the infrastructure investments, where we get control of our fiscal responsibilities by balancing the budget, where we invest in transit and hospitals and schools, but where we also try to make people’s lives better and easier.", "There is nothing more stressful than having to deal with a credit agency which controls your capacity to buy a house, to get a credit card, to get a line of credit. If they’ve got information on you that isn’t true—that it was another person named Speaker, for instance, and then they’re denying you because that particular person named Speaker had bad credit, but it is not you; it’s this other person named Speaker—well, that’s a mistake. You need to be able to go in there and correct it as soon as possible.", "I’m very hopeful that my friends opposite—because I know and I am pretty confident my colleagues on this side of the House will be very supportive of this bill, because it does address an important consumer—I know all members in this House have the best interests of Ontarians at heart.", "So, Speaker, on that note, I look forward to hearing some debate and responding to the very, very important concerns of the members opposite or the support that they have today." ],

I know that people have asked for their credit rating and received it within two days, but going about it and asking for some clarification, I think that’s a worthy part of the bill. It brings in some of the freezes. I’m kind of surprised that he talks about people needing freezes on their credit a number of times a year. He talks about his friends; I’m just wondering what shady neighbourhood he lives in.", "It is something that, with the leaks that we have—we talked about the Equifax breach just a short time ago. There needs to be a willingness, or an obligation, to notify people whose privacy information is breached. Credit ratings are very important. I think it would be best handled by talking to their federal cousins to enforce that federally, because that is something that consumers are concerned about across this country.", "Credit ratings—it is a very substantial issue these days. We talk about people’s ability to pay their bills. Cost of living in this province has skyrocketed over the last 14 years. I’ve had people come in and talk about the inability to pay for the hydro bills and having to go to places—we see many on Yonge Street here—where you get your payday loans. They’re forced—they’re concerned about their credit ratings. This is something where they know that if they miss a date, we’re talking about power being disconnected and an extreme bill later on for connection. This government has driven up the cost of living, and there’s less money available, so credit is more of an issue in everyday life.", "It’s somewhat interesting to talk about the ability to give this information in a very timely manner. I know that we have the Auditor General still waiting for emails from May 31, and 99% of what they requested has not been released by this government. I think it’s a little rich that we talk about the need for somebody else to speed up their release of information, because I think it points back to their own records and what the people of Ontario are looking at. We have some concerns, certainly, about where this goes.", "In this day of electronic records and emails, I think it’s important that information be given out quickly. I think it’s important that people are aware of their credit ratings. I think that, now, you can get it up to twice, free of charge, within a couple of days. So I think that a few extra times is not an onus or a heavy requirement. Those things are likely up to date on an ongoing basis, and the information they have at that time could be released.", "We hope that maybe this government would look at some of the things it’s asking for in this bill, and maybe look at following through on their own credit ratings or their own operations, to reflect more of what’s in this bill. The timely release of information, and holding Ontario consumers paramount, is a good target.", "I think that when we look at the recent releases just this week and we see the abuses of taxpayer money, there’s lots of opportunity to improve, and we’re looking for improvements on this side.", "I know my colleague here would also like to talk to this bill." ],

It seeks to amend the Consumer Reporting Act. It sets a timeline of two business days that consumer reporting agencies would have in order to reply to an inquiry from an Ontario resident. If that consumer is asking for a copy of his or her consumer report, the bill provides that it must be provided free of charge.", "The other provision in this bill would allow each of us, as consumers, to notify these reporting agencies that we wish to place a security freeze on our file. In other words, we want to block anyone from asking for a look at our personal financial information.", "If I could borrow freely from Newton’s third law of motion, I would say that for every action, there is a reaction. This bill is a reaction to the action connected to a breach of consumer information stored by Equifax, earlier this year—not that there’s anything wrong with that—the bill, I mean, and not the breach at Equifax. Any time the private financial information of more than 140 million people is jeopardized, then we should all sit up and take notice.", "I was reading Consumer Reports the other day. There was an article titled “Security Freeze vs. Fraud Alert.” Actually, Speaker, in a former life as a union leader, I used to represent the folks at Consumer Reports as an elected board member of the newspaper guild, the international union to which we belonged at the CBC, as did the editors and writers at Consumer Reports through the New York newspaper guild.", "This article said that many of us are scrambling, after that security breach at Equifax, to understand the difference between fraud alerts and security freezes. If you place a security freeze on your credit file, it will block most lenders from seeing your credit history. This is the single most effective way to protect ourselves against fraud. This CR article explained that if a prospective lender can’t pull your credit report, you won’t be issued a new loan, but it also stops identity thieves from establishing fraudulent accounts using our names.", "Of course, there is a drawback: Simply put, that security freeze also shuts out most of the companies we may wish to do business with from our personal information as well. That could be our banks, our lending institutions, our credit unions, insurers or telecom companies. That being the case, you would have to lift the freeze temporarily to allow them to have access to verify your accounts. Just to be clear, if you already have an account at a credit union or a bank, they already have access to your credit report, as do certain government agencies and collection agencies.", "It gets a little complicated here, but a freeze may be free. It wouldn’t cost you anything in some parts of the United States, for example, if you’ve been a victim of identity theft and you’ve filed a police report. Otherwise, in the States, you could be expected to pay anywhere from $2 to $12 to lift a freeze on a temporary basis at each credit bureau, be it Equifax, Innovis, TransUnion or Experian.", "Now, Speaker, let’s discuss a fraud alert as opposed to a security freeze. For a fraud alert, you just have to connect with one of the big three—TransUnion, Equifax or Experian—and they will pass it along to the others; the smaller Innovis still needs a direct contract. These fraud alerts are good for 90 days—unless, of course, you’ve been a victim of identity theft, and then you can have it extended for up to seven years.", "Consumer Reports says, “You may be better off with the 90-day alert because that allows you to get a free credit report from each of the four credit bureaus each time you renew the alert.", "“With these renewals, you can get 16 free reports per year in addition to the free annual credit report you’re already entitled to....” This “allows you to keep a ... close eye on your file year-round....”", "There have been several disturbing incidents involving these credit-monitoring firms this year. Back in January, the CBC reported that Equifax and TransUnion were “fined a total of $5.5 million US for luring unwitting consumers ‘into costly recurring payments for credit-related products with false promises.’” In addition to the fine, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered the companies “to reimburse consumers for $17.6 million they shouldn’t have been charged” for the services provided.", "You’ve seen the commercials on TV, I’m sure, Speaker, with actors discussing their credit scores and stressing how easy it is to determine your number. Of course, the credit score or number puts you in a classification of either being a good or a bad credit risk, but there are numerous items that should be factored into a complete formula for determining one’s credit worthiness. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau determined that people were being misled if they paid attention to the information being given to them by just one company. Then it ruled that TransUnion and Equifax deceived consumers about just how useful these scores were. Furthermore, they had said these companies made false promises to lure unsuspecting consumers into paying for expensive recurring payments.", "This wasn’t something that had sprung up overnight. “The agency,” according to the CBC, “says TransUnion has been misleading consumers about their actual credit scores since at least 2011. Equifax, meanwhile, was doing the same between 2011 up to 2014.”", "So, Speaker, the industry was already on shaky ground, but to top it off, Equifax gets hacked a few months ago. The files stored there were breached last spring and summer, and even though the company knew about it, it wasn’t reported until September. More than 140 million private files were breached: names, birthdates, social security numbers, driver’s licence numbers—everything you would need to establish a false identity and scam a leading financial institution or, for example, a passport office. On top of that, credit card numbers belonging to more than 200,000 people came into the hands of people who should not have had them. Personal information was also breached for some of us living in Canada and in the United Kingdom.", "This bill is meant to protect us here in Ontario. There will be stricter timelines requiring these agencies to respond to us and to update our files. Recently, my wife and I—Gale and I—both had Visa call us and tell us that it was time to get a new Visa card. We asked why and they wouldn’t tell us. They wouldn’t tell us why except that our information had been breached somehow. So we asked to talk to a supervisor, and it was very difficult to get any information out of them at all, except, finally, a supervisor told us, “Well, there has been a very good chance that your Visa information has been compromised.” They would not say it was in Canada, in the United States, in Toronto or in Windsor. They just warned us that, in our best interests, it was best if we both got new Visa cards, which we’ve had to do.", "So it’s interesting, on a side note, Speaker, that this afternoon we’re talking about this bill that my friend from Beaches–East York is putting forward, and his successes, as he started off the debate, on standing up for consumer protection. He extolled us with all of the many bills that he has had succeed. I was beginning to wonder if this bill was about him, and only him, or about consumer protection. I’m hoping it’s about consumer protection." ],

Now, I know Halloween is coming, Speaker, and I know that some of us like to dress up on Halloween, but I get the sense today that the Liberals are actually dressing up in their NDP orange and pretending they’re the real champions of standing up for the little guy. I get a kick out of that like you wouldn’t believe.", "But at the heart of this bill, if we are talking about consumer protection and not just the ego of the member, the extra-large ego of the member from Beaches–East York, I would say that the bill does do what should have been done 14 years ago. It should have been done four years ago, and it should have been done yesterday, and it should have been done six months ago. It’s good to see that, finally, somebody on the government side of the House—the light bulb clicks on—says, “Hey, an election is coming. We’d better show them that we’re going to stand up for the consumers. We’re going to stand up and try to protect financial information of all of us in Ontario—not just the most vulnerable citizens, but all of us.”", "On that word, my final note is, yes, I think we will be supporting it as well." ],

I think his speech was salient—he spoke to consumer protection during his remarks—and I’m proud to support his stance on this issue.", "Back in a previous life, my first job out of university was in banking. I used to lend money, primarily to companies. Of course, banks rely on services like Equifax quite a bit when they extend—whether it’s something like a personal loan or a credit card or even a commercial loan. So I’m familiar with the use of these credit reports, certainly from the perspective of a lender or a service provider.", "What’s interesting is that the frequency with which these reports are being requested actually continues to increase. There are a number of reasons for that. One of them is the greater prevalence of credit-related products. Every time you apply for a credit-related product, one of these reports is requested by the lender.", "But it’s not always just in the case of credit products that these things are being requested. We can all think of situations where we’ve had to sign off on a credit check being done, even in situations where we sign a new lease or we go to rent an apartment. The use of these credit reports has become quite widespread, and part of it is because of the growth in credit products and part of it is because they are so easy to access, frankly, with the innovations in digital technology and record-keeping. Therefore, it’s all the more important that this data be secure, that it be accurate, and that consumer interests be protected. So I think there are a number of very strong common-sense measures.", "When I think about the requirement proposed in the bill that the consumer be allowed to request, free of charge, their own credit report up to five times per year. I think that’s important for a number of reasons. First of all, it just allows you to know where you stand, right? A lot of us don’t know where we stand. There are companies out there that are promoting this business of providing credit information." ],

Basically the way they sell this product is, they tell you, “Look, you should know where you stand, so pay us to get your information,” right? That, to me, is not in the interest of the consumer. It’s not fair to the consumer to live in fear of where their credit stands.", "Very often, one’s perception of one’s credit is very different than the reality. I can’t tell you how many clients were reputable, credible business people who came to the bank to borrow money, who had been borrowing with us for years, who had a stellar repayment record, and then when we pulled their credit check, there were errors in it and mistakes due to identity confusion, for a bunch of reasons. So it’s important to know where you stand, and I think that that makes common sense.", "It also allows you to correct things as you go. You don’t discover that there is an error when you go to apply for a credit card or a loan, and you get rejected because of some sort of mistake in your credit record. I really think that’s a good measure.", "I think another good measure here is the security freeze in the consumer’s file. Every time a credit file gets checked, that affects your credit rating. That’s an important thing for people to know. Every time you apply for a credit card, every time someone checks your credit file, that can actually affect your credit rating—just the check, not necessarily the acquisition of a credit card or a loan. Being able to put a freeze on it will protect people from this sort of thing as well. I think that’s a very important thing for consumers to know.", "Having to respond in a timely fashion, that requirement—I think that’s just good customer service. If it’s not being done already, I think it makes sense that it be done again.", "So I think there are a number of things here that are related to greater customer service and protecting consumers’ interests. This is really important. It’s continuously a more important space for us to protect consumers, so I’m proud of the member from Beaches–East York for introducing this and I’m proud to support his legislation." ],

I want to acknowledge my colleague from Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry, who has done a great deal of work in the whole consumer protection file—Jim McDonell. He does a great job and keeps us, as a caucus, informed of the various pieces of legislation that need updating, and what we’re doing out there.", "The recent Equifax breach, where millions of United States, United Kingdom and an undisclosed number of Canadian consumers’ personal information was hacked, was definitely a wake-up call about the need to do better to protect consumers and their privacy. Firstly, the fact that the cyber attack happened to Equifax, which is a credit-monitoring company we expect to always safeguard our personal information, is astounding. But we know that there are people out there, the nefarious types, who are trying to do those negative things and be harmful. I’ve always wondered why people who are that bright, and can break in and hack something like that, can’t put their time and energy into something like breaking the code for a cancer cure or doing something with our health care system that’s a positive, instead of all these negatives that really have an impact on people’s lives.", "If your credit rating is impacted by this hack, then that can have repercussions for people even in their day-to-day living. It has an impact on their bank accounts; it has an impact on their ability to purchase things, on their mortgages and all of those types of things. It has such a huge impact. That ripple effect takes time and energy that people have to spend that could be put to a more positive use.", "Secondly, the breached data is believed to have included names, addresses and social insurance numbers, which are the key to most of us, frankly. I was in the Armed Forces for a period, doing basic training, and I’ll tell you, that was the only thing I was really known by. So I today can state that number off the top of my head; it’s one of the few numbers that I have with me at all times. It scares me to know that other people have that, because that is fundamental to who you are. They can then take those numbers and use them against you, particularly if your credit card numbers are hacked and they have access to that. They can steal that victim’s identity and fraudulently open a credit account in that person’s name. Again, the stress and the anxiety—if there’s a $10,000 bill on my credit card, I can tell you the stress and anxiety when my wife opens up that bill and wonders what I’ve been buying, if it’s not something like a trip to Hawaii for her. Those are always alarming things for all of us.", "Finally, the fact that no one knows how many victims there are, or how long they’ll be at risk of identity theft, is very concerning. It prohibits them from making important decisions in regard to securing credit for other important life purchases. We just talked earlier today about life insurance and those types of things. People are trying, because of the state that they find themselves in nowadays, to find all kinds of different accesses to resources to live comfortably in their life, like that life insurance bill—the life settlements bill—we just talked about.", "Considering that Equifax plays such an important role in determining our financial future as well as safeguarding sensitive personal information, we as consumers should have the right to know if our personal information was compromised and the steps we should take in order to protect ourselves. That’s one of the big things I think the general public out there wants to know. We’re going online with all kinds of things. Again, it’s a generational thing. The young, wonderful pages in front of you, they’ll do everything on these phones—in fact, most of them probably already do—and you wonder what will happen in 10 years. All of that data is in that device. All of that data for your whole life is somewhere in that electronic world, so we definitely want—I think all consumers want—to have the comfort and the trust of being safeguarded.", "There are ways to do that. We use things like encryption. If you think of BlackBerry and RIM in Waterloo—my colleague Michael Harris’s riding of Kitchener–Conestoga—that technology still is the best out there to be able to talk peer to peer. It’s encrypted and people can’t hack into it—or at least they haven’t figured out ways to yet.", "I’ll go back to the bill. For these reasons, the Equifax cybersecurity breach ranks among the worst to date, but it follows similar breaches at Yahoo, eBay and LinkedIn, and all these privacy disasters shed light on the existing flaws in consumer protection. It’s challenging for those companies, because there’s always some nefarious type out there trying to break in and hack and do these negative things, as opposed to applying good.", "Bill 167 promises to extend privacy measures for consumers, but to be honest, I don’t know if that will be enough. What’s proposed in the bill is to compel the credit reporting companies to provide a consumer’s credit file to the consumer free of charge, to answer consumer inquiries within two business days, and to allow consumers the option of placing a security freeze on their credit file.", "The reason I question if it will be enough is because consumers already have the right to access their credit file twice a year for free from every reporting agency, and they can already place a security notice on their credit files, which would make it more difficult for anyone—including themselves—to secure credit without a more attentive verification of the person’s identity.", "As my colleague the MPP for Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry, Jim McDonell, suggested, reporting companies could improve their customer service and online access, but this bill actually does not even mention these aspects. Neither does this bill do anything to help consumers get answers when a privacy breach is suspected. I think that is something that we should always have foremost in our minds: accountability and transparency. There should be a protocol that I will be told within X-Y-Z hours, or a day, 24 hours—whatever the case may be—and there should be no compelling reason why that can’t happen so that you know exactly what the situation in your life is.", "In Ontario and other Canadian provinces, there exists no mandatory requirement for private sector entities to report in regard to a potential or actual privacy breach. I think that is something that should be addressed in this bill. It certainly should come up at committee, so that that is added as an amendment. There should be very strict protocols on everyone and they should be consistent and standard, not only for Ontario but across the great country of Canada, so that everyone is playing by the same rules.", "I think the members on the other side have a great opportunity to push for federal regulations to be put through to ensure consumers are better protected and prepared in future cases of security breaches. The last Conservative federal government passed changes to privacy legislation that would make such disclosures mandatory.", "I would ask respectfully that this government push just as hard against the federal Liberal cousins that they have and the Prime Minister of today, as they would if it was Prime Minister Harper who was still there, and the Conservatives. I can guarantee you, Madam Speaker, that if this was happening under his watch, they would be standing over there, screaming from the rafters about him not complying and not doing a thing to protect consumers. I am going to put that little challenge out to them.", "I’m going to leave my last few seconds to things that continually get asked of me. When we have a bill like this, people on the street will come up to me and say, “Isn’t it interesting that the Liberals are asking you about something like consumer protection for breaches of privacy and yet they spent a billion dollars for eHealth,” for which we have nothing to show. They spent millions of dollars on a diabetes registry and yet there’s nothing to show for it. All that same type of thing is in there from a perspective of privacy, and we want to have that security and integrity in the system.", "I think the government could and should be doing more to prevent future security breaches and access to critical consumer information. It’s essential that we educate Canadians on their rights to a variety of privacy measures. I hope, at the end of the day—again, I’m going to support. I applaud. I think there are ways—" ],

We heard from another member how that is often an expensive thing to do. There are companies making money on the backs of consumers who want these kinds of reports.", "The other part of this bill, which I think is very good and unique, is that it requires that the consumer be provided the report in the form of the consumer’s choosing. Of course, as the minister for accessibility, I also say it’s important that we get the right formats for these things to make sure they are compliant with our accessibility legislation here in Ontario.", "As always, when we introduce bills in this House, whether it’s consumer protection or other things, it is important that we discuss and look at how the details of compliance and enforcement will work.

Since 2004, we have more than doubled the number of occupational health and safety inspectors. Additionally, we launched the highly effective Safe At Work Ontario inspection strategy to ensure that measures laid out by the Occupational Health and Safety Act are actually being enforced.", "We have worked hard to make sure that the health and safety of every Ontarian is a priority and that fairness in the workplace means more than good rhetoric but real actions. We also know that we can be and should be always doing more to ensure that work is safe and fair in our province.", "We have heard stories for years now from women across the country and across this province who have suffered workplace injuries because of policy mandating that employees wear high heels. In fact, this issue was brought to my attention by members of my staff earlier this year who have worked in a number of restaurants, bars and other hospitality jobs. They shared their own experiences and the experiences of their co-workers, stories of sprained and broken ankles, of bleeding and blistered feet, and that this is happening in everything from fine dining to dive bars.", "I want to take a moment here to thank Alexander Byrne-Krzycki and Pax Layla Gale-Santos for sharing these stories with me, because those stories are what made me realize that we need to act to protect these workers.", "We know that inappropriate, unsafe footwear, like high heels, comes with a slew of health risks. This goes beyond the fact that these shoes can be uncomfortable; they are dangerous. Madam Speaker, this isn’t just conjecture and complaints. We have the science to back it up. In 2016, a study published by BioMed Central Public Health reviewed a total of 506 unique records, 27 full-text publications and screened 20 publications. The study found that there is clear evidence that there is an association between women who wear high heels and hallux valgus, musculoskeletal pain, first-party injury and osteoarthritis.", "But it doesn’t end there. We have studies that have shown an association between leg swelling, chronic muscle shortening and damage to tendons from long-term use. With this information, it is no wonder that Dr. James Hill, president of the Ontario Podiatric Medical Association, says, “Podiatrists treat foot pain and deformities in women twice as often as foot disabilities in men.”", "With this information, we know there is no shortage of reasons for why high heels are unsafe workplace footwear, and continuing to allow companies to mandate they be worn by employees is antithetical to safety and equality in the workplace. These dress codes are hurting workers across the province, literally. That is why I introduced the Putting Your Best Foot Forward Act, 2017.", "To fix the issue of dress codes that mandate unsafe footwear, the bill amends the Occupational Health and Safety Act to prohibit employers from requiring an employee to wear footwear that is not appropriate to the protection required for their work or that does not allow the employee to safely perform his or her work.", "As this House knows, current footwear protections under the Occupational Health and Safety Act deal with confined spaces, construction projects, health care, residential facilities, industrial establishments, mines and mining plants. This ensures that workers who may be susceptible to specific hazards or foot injury are protected by these regulations at their workplaces. There is also a general duty clause for employers under the Occupational Health and Safety Act to take every precaution reasonable for the protection of a worker.", "My bill would amend the act to specifically protect all workers from being required by their employers to wear unsafe footwear, such as heels. I made the decision to amend the Occupational Health and Safety Act because it will further enhance protections for employees who are currently suffering from being forced to wear unsafe footwear, specifically high heels, by their employers.", "The bill would further codify the protection of workers under the Ministry of Labour’s enforcement of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and its regulations. This means that workers would be further protected by the 445 health and safety inspectors who work tirelessly every day across this province to ensure compliance and to ensure workers are protected.", "All that said, this bill by no means bans high heels. We want workers to wear whatever makes them feel comfortable and keeps them safe by tackling mandatory heels.", "I want to say that over the past several days, I have had an outpouring of support from women and men all across the province in support of this bill. I would like to share a couple of their stories to demonstrate to the House the vital importance of this bill.", "After tabling my bill, I received a story from Mireille in Toronto who told me that she had received a permanent stress fracture in her foot due to poor footwear on the job. I also received a story from Janet, who told me about how her daughter was threatened with job loss if she didn’t wear high heels, despite having a note from her doctor detailing her back condition and how that footwear would be damaging to her overall health", "From my riding of Davenport to London, Windsor, Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie and Ottawa, we have heard that this bill needs to be passed. This isn’t just an issue at Dufferin and Dundas in my riding, but it’s one that is hurting people in Dawson and Deseronto. This is a bill that would improve the lives of workers across our province, and it is time for this Legislature to step up and act", "Madam Speaker, I’ve laid out the facts, the problem, the solution and the support. The facts are that we, as a government, are proud of our record in protecting the health and safety of Ontario workers. Ontario has one of the best safety records in Canada.", "Since 2004, we have more than doubled the number of occupational health and safety inspectors and launched a highly effective Safe At Work Ontario inspection strategy. It’s also a fact that, today, we have more than 400 field inspectors visiting workplaces across the province, and it is a fact that those inspectors conducted just under 80,000 visits to over 34,000 workplaces and issued more than 118,000 orders because of non-compliance with Ontario’s Occupational Health and Safety Act, and that’s just in 2016-17.", "But we know there is more that we can do to protect workers, especially from unsafe footwear that is mandated by an employer. We have a heard stories from all across this province of unsafe and uncomfortable footwear, and we have the science and the evidence to show that inappropriate footwear, like high heels, can damage feet in the short term and over extended periods of time.", "I have shown that we have a solution to the problem with the Putting Your Best Foot Forward Act, 2017. This bill further protects workers and ensures that unsafe footwear in the workplace can be dealt with by the over 400 field inspectors who are highly skilled, exceedingly qualified and protecting our workforce every day.", "Madam Speaker, I have shown you the support. I have spoken to people about this issue from Bay Street to the Bay of Quinte, and Ontarians agree that we need to better protect workers. It’s time that we all step up and put our best foot forward.", "I invite all parties of the House to join me today and help further protect workers across our province. I personally believe that this bill should be a shoo-in, and it is my sincere hope that my colleagues across the aisle agree." ],

But if this government was truly proactive in this area, she wouldn’t have to bring forth this bill, because the government themselves would have ensured that appropriate footwear would be worn, and that you could not be compelled to wear inappropriate footwear.", "In British Columbia, when Christy Clark was the Liberal Premier, she made this happen with a simple amendment to the Workers Compensation Act. Why is it taking a private member’s bill in Kathleen Wynne’s Liberal Ontario to protect—primarily, obviously, mostly women. You wouldn’t want to see me stumbling around in a pair of high heels. How uncomfortable they could be in a workplace if you’re told you’ve got to wear them and you’ve got a four-hour, eight-hour or whatever shift in the food service industry, how it must feel at the end of the day.", "Ironically, my wife and I were at a gala on Saturday night for the Pembroke Regional Hospital. My wife used to wear high heels all the time. When she started work—she was working in a secretarial job—she wore high heels at work. She worked in lawyers’ offices and stuff like that, and she was wearing high heels all the time. But she doesn’t wear them very often anymore because she’s a real estate agent. She’s outside walking up steps, walking on trails, showing properties. High heels aren’t appropriate. They wouldn’t be very comfortable and they wouldn’t be safe. But she told me on Sunday morning how sore her legs were, just by having worn them, when she’s not used to wearing them anymore, at that gala on Saturday evening, particularly if you haven’t been wearing them for a while.", "If you’re forced to wear a particular kind of footwear for your job, you don’t have much of a choice. So it’s up to the government to protect you and say, “You can’t be forced to wear a particular type of footwear on your job.” You wouldn’t expect people to be wearing high heels in the construction industry. Why should we expect that they can be compelled to wear high heels in the hospitality, the food service or the restaurant wait business?", "The bill is right. We’re going to support the bill, but I do, I think properly, chastise the government—which the member for Davenport believes is so advanced and so forward-thinking—that their ministers have not brought forth legislation themselves, or that the Premier has not brought forth legislation herself, to ensure that women can’t be forced to wear a particular type of footwear in the workplace.", "Almost as unusual as eclipses of the sun are Toronto Star editorials that are critical of the Liberals, but we have one here that was in the Sun today—did I say the Sun? I meant the Toronto Star—justifiably criticizing this government for failing to act on this issue. It’s absolutely ridiculous that we have to have a private member bringing forth the issue to the floor of this Legislature. It’s time for this government, as the headline says, “Time to Walk the Talk.” They always talk about how they’re protecting the rights of women and making sure that people are not forced to do things they don’t want to do. If someone chooses to wear high heels at work, that is their choice. But if you truly want to be legitimate and be able to back what you say, then this shouldn’t sit—because this could languish as a private member’s bill for months, until the election. If it’s not proclaimed, it will die.", "If this government truly wants to act and protect women’s rights in the workplace, then bring in this legislation themselves." ],

I understand that the scope of the bill does not only cover the hospitality industry, but I do know it well, and I will start by speaking to that directly.", "As many in this House know, I worked in hospitality for many years, but I was fortunate enough not to have been asked to wear heels to perform my duties. The job consists of a steady, fast-paced environment where we’re running from table to table to the wait station to the kitchen and back to the table, over and over again, and it can be completely exhausting. During lunch or a dinner rush, there’s rarely an opportunity to stop for a restroom break, never mind a quick snack. Sometimes it’s a luxury to be able to catch your breath.", "Imagine having to do that in heels. The wear and tear that women feel on their legs and their feet can put them in excruciating pain in the moment and later in the day, as well as later in life. Doing this for years could cause a lifetime of damage. I know the pain that I felt from some of those busy days in proper footwear, so I can’t imagine what it would feel like to have to do that in high heels.", "James Hill is the president of the Ontario Podiatric Medical Association, and he was quoted as saying that the wearing of heels causes a “higher incidence of bunions, musculoskeletal pain and injury” than in those who do not wear them.", "But, Speaker, the problem isn’t just heels. In March of 2016, the Ontario Human Rights Commissioner Renu Mandhane spoke out to remind “employers that requiring women to wear low-cut tops and short skirts, tight dresses or high heels could violate the Human Rights Code.”", "In March of this year, she published a report—Not on the Menu: Inquiry Report on Sexualized and Gender-based Dress Codes in Ontario Restaurants. I want to thank the commissioner for her work on this problem and for raising awareness on this issue. It is important that women know what is not acceptable and that they have an avenue for complaints.", "But, Speaker, women shouldn’t have to take a complaint to the Human Rights Commission and go through the whole ordeal of a tribunal. It should be the law, and employers should not be allowed to do it, period. That is what this bill seeks to do, and I’m happy for that, but this bill only addresses one item of clothing—high heels—and that, I think, is unfortunate.", "I think an opportunity has been missed to address the much broader problem of sexualized and gender-based dress codes. Women, primarily younger women working in highly precarious settings, are being forced to wear revealing clothing. Their sexuality continues to be exploited by employers in Ontario for the sake of sales and profit. Despite the excellent work of the Human Rights Commissioner, more needs to be done and it needs to be done by this Legislature with meaningful laws to make the practice illegal.", "Women in precarious positions can no longer be expected to fight this on their own, as suggested by the minister of women’s issues in March of 2016. At the time, the minister told reporters “that she hopes women troubled by dress codes will raise concerns with their bosses but” she had no “plans to take stronger action.”", "In the report that I mentioned previously, the Human Rights Commissioner pointed out that work in the restaurant industry is precarious. Low wages are common, they rely on tips and have to work part-time hours. Worker vulnerability is increased by the prevalence of sexual harassment and sex discrimination. There is a lack of awareness of human rights laws. Few of them have the benefit of a union to protect their rights. Over one third of the workers are young women under the age of 24. Many are recent immigrants. All of this leads to the fact that, in the words of the report, “Some workers fear reprisal for raising concerns about dress codes and other sexual harassment.”", "To suggest that the solution for these young women is to speak to their employer is absolutely unacceptable. It is completely divorced from the reality of the nature of the work and the situation of the workers. Yet again, it is clear that this government has absolutely no idea what it is like for people living ordinary lives.", "This bill is a step forward.

MPP Martins is a good friend and colleague, and I’m pleased to speak to her bill today. I’d like to remind members that MPP Martins is a member of our government, and is moving forward with a very important bill.", "As a young university student, one of my first jobs was in retail. I was one of tens of thousands of people who work tirelessly in retail, restaurants and hospitals every day, who have to work on their feet day in and out. Let me tell you, it wasn’t easy. It wasn’t easy to stand for close to eight hours a day in heels. And in those days, where I was working, we were discouraged from taking breaks and sitting down except when we were on lunch or our coffee breaks. The reality was that we were standing much of the time. And I have to say that I was young at the time, and didn’t understand or realize what my rights were.", "Speaker, the reality is that what women wear to work on their feet has become a safety issue, an equality issue and an empowerment issue. I’m pleased that MPP Martins is moving forward with this, because wearing heels can often lead to falls, calluses and back pain. Let me be clear: What women wear should be their choice. That’s why I’m so pleased to speak to this private member’s bill. I want to thank MPP Martins again, because I’m proud of what our government is doing on this.", "Speaker, as the Minister of the Status of Women, I have ongoing discussions with my colleagues every day, whether it is about the security or the empowerment of women in this province. I speak to the Minister of Finance, Minister Sousa, about our expectations for women in leadership, and to the Minister of Labour, Minister Flynn, about the gender wage gap. I speak to the Minister of Community and Social Services, Minister Jaczek, about a strategy to end human trafficking and gender-based violence, including domestic violence, and I speak to the Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation about ending violence against indigenous women and girls. I worked with Attorney General Naqvi on proposing legislation for safe access to abortion clinics and the Minister of Health, Minister Hoskins, on free access to the abortion pill.", "Today, I rise to support my colleague and friend Cristina Martins and the Putting Your Best Foot Forward Act, which is about making sure that every workplace is safer, more equal and an accessible place for women, because when women lead, they don’t need to wear high heels. When women are concerned about their personal safety and health, they don’t need to wear high heels. When women are marching in the streets, as thousands of us did a few months back, for equality, they don’t need to wear high heels.", "Speaker, let me send a clear message to women and to employers: Women are standing their ground. They are fighting for their rights as never before, and they don’t need to wear high heels to do it. Women have the right to wear comfortable footwear and to do so without fear of losing their jobs.", "The statistics tell us women are more likely to be in precarious work, more likely at minimum wage, more likely to work shifts and part time. That’s unacceptable. That’s why we are working on these items. That is why we are raising the minimum wage and offering free tuition, so women can retrain and re-enter the workforce. That’s why we are offering domestic leave for women exiting violent relationships, and that is why we are working right now on building a woman’s economic empowerment strategy, work that I know I am proud of doing.", "We know there is more work to do to ensure women can reach their full economic potential. As a government, we know we stand for fair and equal economic opportunities for all women in Ontario. I would like to remind everybody in this House that this is the government that came up with a Ministry of the Status of Women. This is the government that took that bold move. This is the government that is moving forward with this bill today. Others were in power in the past and didn’t do it. We are doing it today with this act.", "As a government, we stand for fair and equal economic opportunities, because we know the women of Ontario deserve fair and equal opportunities.

It’s quite interesting. I just want to mention that the member from Davenport and I are probably the two shortest, vertically-challenged members of the Ontario Legislature. I would think that if she was putting forward any type of bill to discuss high heels, it would be something like, “Anybody 5 foot 6 and higher should not be allowed to wear high heels, especially in our workplace.”", "Alas, what we’re discussing here is whether employers should be allowed to make it mandatory for their employees who are female to wear high heels. We do discuss here sometimes some interesting topics, and it is an interesting topic, but it really should be part of a broader discussion about gender-based—what we were calling earlier sexualized—outfits at work that women unfortunately have to deal with far more often than men. It’s not just footwear—we’ve changed Speakers now, so now it’s Mr. Speaker. It’s not just footwear, Mr. Speaker. It’s also short skirts, tight clothing and low-cut tops that can affect women—not just how they feel about themselves, but how they are treated in the workplace by other workers or by customers.", "Women shouldn’t have to dress a certain way in order to earn a living—I think we all agree with that—and women shouldn’t have to feel that they need to wear high heels in a dangerous sort of situation. They are having to climb stairs in high heels. It definitely makes us feel uncomfortable to imagine employers who don’t have to wear high heels telling their employees to wear high heels.", "There are workplaces that do demand certain types of footwear. There are construction sites where they have to wear construction boots with steel toes. Why is that, Mr. Speaker? It’s so that the employees are safer. Imagine that. There are all these rules and regulations about what employees have to wear, from head coverings to covering their toes, in workplaces to make them safer. Yet, here we are, we’re having a discussion on the opposite end of the spectrum about employees who are being told they have to wear something that the employers know very well is less comfortable and less safe.", "Yes, it’s 2017, and it’s hard to believe that, in a way, the government has been in power for 14 years, for a while, and they have tried to label themselves a women-friendly government with a lot of women in the cabinet. It is unfortunate, in a way—that’s what I was explaining earlier—that this is a private member’s bill, because really it could have been put in a piece of government legislation very easily. They didn’t have to wait for a private member to bring it forward. I’m guessing that she got the idea because British Columbia banned mandatory high heels last April, and the sky doesn’t seem to have fallen on that province in terms of dealing with it in the workplace.", "You would think that employees would be able to say to their employer that they don’t want to wear high heels, and that would be that. But even if it’s made mandatory, Mr. Speaker, what happens? So it’s not mandatory, they can’t force them, but some employees worry that they’re going to get less shifts the next week, or the next month. Employees talk about how they’re worried that their tips are going to go down if they don’t dress a certain way, act a certain way and wear heels.", "I think that there’s a broader problem here, and that legislation can go just so far. A lot of the issue has to come from our attitudes within the Legislature, making rules and regulations for the province to abide by, but also how we put forward—the government, with all of us together—the right attitudes for employers. How do we get people to possibly, as the Toronto Star said today, talk the talk and walk the walk?", "I’m just going to talk a little bit about it. The Toronto Star brought up that the Ontario Human Rights Commission has raised the issue and they’ve warned employers that they could be violating the Human Rights Code. They are surprised that the government has not dealt with this until now. They had some strong words about the Minister of Government and Consumer Services not doing enough. We just heard before from the Minister of the Status of Women. They feel that women should have the support of their Legislatures in feeling safe. There’s a concern out there that women are more susceptible to sexual harassment in the workplace—again, by colleagues, by employers and by customers—if they are forced to dress or act a certain way.", "I just want to quote, very quickly, Julie Lalonde. She’s a host of the Third Wave, a feminist radio show, and she’s a support worker at the Sexual Assault Support Centre. She says she’s a woman and a feminist. She loves high heels. “Against my chiropractor’s advice, I own too many pairs of shoes to count and love how they make me feel. You can pry my stilettos from my cold, dead hands. But my shoes are my choice. I wear heels because my job doesn’t entail standing on my feet all day or running back and forth across a busy restaurant with heavy plates in each hand. Nobody should be forced to wear high heels and the fact that it’s even up for debate in 2017 speaks volumes about women’s place in society. How do we expect women to be equal to men”—" ],

I commend the member from Davenport for bringing forward this bill.", "It’s something that, I guess, if you’re not in the industry—I have never worked in the hospitality or service industry and I’ve obviously never been a woman, so I wouldn’t know what it is like to be told what to wear, told how to dress and perhaps told how to act. It’s that objectification of yourself, of your gender that I think is something that none of us in this House can stand for and all of us should do our utmost to eliminate.", "I think this bill takes a step forward in bringing awareness that this actually happens.

I would imagine that if I knew I was about to enter into a place of business that had this as a mandate or as a code, I would definitely not go in there. I would not frequent it. I wouldn’t give them my money because of all the reasons: because of the nature of the sexualisation of our work and society, the objectification of women and our responsibility to do better as a society.", "I have had the great opportunity to work with men and women who have dedicated their lives to preventing and fighting sexual assault, abuse and violence. I have had the opportunity to partake in an event called Walk a Mile in Her Shoes. It challenges men to put on high heels, actually, to walk a mile and to understand not only the physical demands on your body in those crazy shoes that I could never imagine you could wear and function in in any capacity—but I give credit to those who can—but also to feel that people are looking at you and the objectification. I was happy to join Chief Al Frederick from Windsor police one year. We walked in those things and we couldn’t make it.", "The point there was that what do we do, what are the demands, what are the expectations we put on women to look a certain way, to act a certain way? And what is the response from society, from people when we do that? It’s something that I hope this bill addresses. Certainly in the workplace, there is no question that an employer cannot, should not and hopefully will not ever force anyone to wear high heels when, of course, it isn’t appropriate and, of course, when that employee doesn’t want to.", "I want to give a shout-out to all those who have partaken in that exercise and who continue to raise awareness about sexual assault and abuse in our communities, and the great work they do.", "My colleague Monique Taylor, the member from Hamilton Mountain, talked about the nature of precarious work. Many times, women in these industries feel as though there are no other options. They do what they are told or else that’s it, they won’t be employed; there won’t be another shift in the next day or the next week. So it’s incumbent upon us, again, and the government, to not only look at the nature of precarious work in our communities but to look at enforcement. Because you are proscribing something here that will have a tangible effect.", "My hope is that the government acts accordingly and applies the adequate enforcement not only for this proscription but for all the others stresses, strains and demands that are put on workers, whether they be health and safety related or not. That’s an enormous part of the nature of labour in our communities that hasn’t been addressed. It leads us to discrimination, it leads to oppression, it leads to workplace injuries, and it leads to an overall failure in our economy to protect the most vulnerable.", "So, Speaker, I certainly will support this bill. I look forward to it gaining prominence throughout the province, sending that message that this is not acceptable and there is a better way." ],

It undermines the respect that we have for each other in this House, that any one of us—sure, the government could have taken this on. But for a member on our side of the House, a backbencher, not a member of cabinet, to be able to pick up on an item—on this particular debate, let’s just say that the high heels were stuck in a crack. Because, Speaker, when you think about the incredibly dense legislative agenda we’ve had since we came in in 2014, this is not about going back to 2003. This is about 2013, when the Premier was elected, took charge and took the reins, and 2014, when she came in with this exemplary majority government.", "So I really think you need to back off from that line of criticism. I think it’s disrespectful to House, and I think it’s also driving a wedge in their own opposition benches. I’ve seen the tweet from their own leader, where he says, “No monopoly on a good idea”—kudos to the member for Davenport, whereas we’re getting criticism from the other side. So I think, on this item, you should listen to your leader and respect what we’re doing on this side of the House.", "I also want to talk a little bit about our good friend the member of the official opposition, the leader of the second party—soon to be third party, possibly. He and I have something in common in that we’re both minority-interest owners in a restaurant." ],

I can tell you that in our restaurant, we don’t require any server, male or female, to wear high heels. But we do require a dress code. So let’s be very clear: Dress codes are permitted. You need to allow people to have dress codes to send a certain image off to the customer base. The issue here is not sexualizing the dress code, making it gender-neutral, and not having the footwear be unsafe.", "As we do in construction, there’s a positive obligation on an employer to ensure employees are safe. Having a worker in a restaurant who is going back and forth, as the member from Hamilton Mountain talked about--it’s fast.

Why do you have to have legislation to prohibit requiring women to wear high heels to work? It doesn’t seem as if it’s something that you should have to do. It doesn’t seem as if that should be necessary. But do you know what? It is necessary. There are workplaces and places that require women to wear high heels to provide a service, and that doesn’t seem fair. It doesn’t seem that that is the kind of equity in the workplace that you would want or would expect.", "I want to commend the member from Davenport for recognizing this as a challenge in Ontario and putting forward this bill to eliminate the need for women to be put in that situation or that circumstance. Imagine if someone has a back problem or for some reason cannot meet those requirements. They would have to either not perform that particular task and limit their choices, or look for a reason to appeal to the will of the employer. That doesn’t seem fair. It doesn’t seem as if that is necessary.", "In the week of Persons Day, I’m standing today in my flat shoes in support of this bill, which is all about equity. It’s all about the dignity of individuals and the human rights of individuals. A woman should be able to wear whatever she would like to wear. It seems very, very obvious, just like it’s obvious that women are persons, but at some point we had to put that in law, and then have all of the rights and privileges that come along with it. This bill, while it is obvious, is not happening in certain parts of our workplaces and our communities, and it’s just not fair.", "I support this bill.

I wanted to start off with what the member from Essex commented on, and the excellent male perspective that he took when he weighed in on this bill.

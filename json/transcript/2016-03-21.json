In order of the groups most targeted for hate, the Jewish community, unfortunately, was first, LGBTQ, followed by the Muslim community and—they were really quite close—the black community as well, and then different communities where it’s a multi-bias, and they can’t really necessarily say that it’s targeting one community or the other.", "I really hope that the anti-racism panel is going to bring in all the community groups I mentioned previously, that are meeting right now at the anti-poverty forum, to consult with them and have them on the panel so that much more can be done and so that it doesn’t just turn out to be more photo ops; and that we actually accomplish something and don’t have to keep having these discussions year after year, and we can stop having the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and focus on tomatoes, as the member just promoted." ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, we know we need to fight racism everywhere, every day, but every year on March 21 we mark International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and all eyes should be on the issue.", "Today, I am participating in the Racism Free Ontario forum here in Toronto, which that brings together individuals and organizations from across the province with the singular goal of eliminating racism. I want to give thanks to and recognize organizations like Colour of Poverty–Colour of Change and the Council of Agencies Serving South Asians, who are leading the efforts to ensure that Ontario achieves the goal of becoming a racist-free province.", "Today, four key elements will be focused on, including employment, education, justice and health care, along with the newly announced Ontario Anti-Racism Directorate. When we look at these key areas, it becomes easy to see why they need our attention.", "Take employment, for example: On Thursday of last week, the Toronto Star published an article by Nicholas Keung, their immigration reporter, titled “Jobseekers Resort to ‘Resumé Whitening’ to Get a Foot in the Door, Study Shows.” Keung reported, “According to a two-year study led by University of Toronto researchers, as many as 40% of minority jobseekers ‘whiten’ their resumés by adopting anglicized names and downplaying experience with racial groups to bypass biased screeners and just get their foot in the door....", "“In the study, only 10% of black job applicants—created by researchers based on real candidate profiles—received callbacks for job interviews if they stuck to their African names and experience with black organizations. However, the callback rate went up to 25.5% if their names were ‘whitened’ and their black experience was removed from their resumés.”", "Education research shows that there is an obvious gap for people of colour. Unequal Access, a report prepared for the Canadian Race Relations Foundation, noted that the high school non-completion rate is highest among aboriginal youth, compared to visible minority and non-racialized youth. Among Canadian-born youth aged 15 to 19 in 1996, about three in 10 aboriginal youth did not finish high school and were not attending school in the past year, compared to less than one in 10 among visible minorities. Further, it was proven that when racial minorities have attained a university-level education, they are still less likely than non-racialized groups to be in the top income quintile. About 38% of the Canadian-born non-racialized group with a university education were in the top income quintile, compared to 29% of Canadian-born visible minorities and 21% of foreign-born visible minorities.", "In health care, racial inequality is most often indirect and systemic. From the under-representation of racialized groups in the medical profession to the delivery of culturally sensitive care, the challenges experienced by racialized groups are disheartening. We must also factor in the impacts of socio-economic status in health care. A statistic generated by the advisory committee on population health showed that when questioned about their health, only 47% of Canadians in the lowest income bracket rated their health as very good or excellent, compared to 73% of Canadians in the highest income group.", "The stats from the justice community are even less hopeful. Right here in Ontario, the question of carding is still unanswered, despite the practice being banned as it disproportionately affects black and brown men. To those who have not experienced racial profiling or do not know someone who has, it may seem to be nothing more than a mere inconvenience. However, racial profiling is much more than that. It is much more than a hassle or an annoyance. It is real. It is having real, direct consequences. Those who experience profiling pay the price emotionally, psychologically, mentally and, in some cases, even financially and physically.", "We know that we still have much work ahead of us in Ontario to combat racism, and the newly announced Anti-Racism Directorate is most welcome. However, more important than the existence of the directorate will be funding it appropriately and giving it a mandate that will actually accomplish our common goal of creating a province free from racism so that every Ontarian can live with respect and dignity." ],

People are worried. A lot of it seemed to revolve around money. Now, granted, I was going in and out of businesses. There was a lot of concern.

There’s anger. The anger is directed towards this government, by and large. I will say—and this is no surprise to many people; perhaps this is the nature when you have a party that has been in government for a large number of years, like the present government—that much of the anger was very specifically directed towards the Premier.", "I raised issues of what’s going on here and raised issues of the budget that was presented a number of weeks ago.

Maybe I’m not plugged in. I’m still not sure why it was brought down two months earlier. I really have no idea. Maybe during the two-minute responses we will hear the reason. But it was brought down two months earlier than normal, for whatever reason. The federal budget is coming down tomorrow. I find it unusual that a provincial, let alone a municipal, which you would never see, would bring down a budget before they knew what they were getting or the partnerships that were being negotiated at the provincial or the federal level. It’s very, very unusual, and maybe we’ll find out the reason why.", "The result of bringing it down two months earlier: a lot of the numbers are missing. A lot of the answers are not there, the program details. Even though we’ve got a budget book—I don’t have one at hand—with hundreds of pages, details are missing.", "I personally feel that, at minimum, this budget should have waited at least until after the recommendations and the feedback from the pre-budget hearings had come in.

Why was this budget brought down before the report came in, the feedback came in?", "I do sit on the finance committee, Speaker.

We are launching a major campaign called Taste Your Future because there aren’t enough people trained in our industry to take these jobs.

He puts it out as the largest manufacturing sector in Ontario—larger than auto—a sector that generates $40.7 billion in revenue.", "A ministry like the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs is a very important ministry, not only for farming but for the food and beverage sector. I’ve just explained the significance of that sector in our economy. The concern is with the cuts to the ag budget, a ministry that is one of the smallest ministries in the province of Ontario. So there is concern on that front.", "The recession in 2008: Ontario was hit, partly because of our dependence on auto. But at that time, the food and beverage sector continued to grow, and it grew 11% from 2007 to 2012. During these continued dismal times in the province of Ontario, and in spite of that, the ag sector—the food sector—continues to essentially operate in not only a steady state but to grow, and this is positive. I would think that that is something we could capitalize on. To get into that debate of winners and losers, I know that this government does pick and choose, company by company, which is a bad idea, rather than sector by sector. Sometimes they pick winners; sometimes they pick losers. At the end of the day, we’re just not sure how effective those kinds of company-by-company grants are and what is the positive impact, if any.", "City of Toronto: second only to Chicago as a food processing hub in North America. But we’ve also got close to the highest electricity rates in North America. We have the highest debt load of any sub-sovereign jurisdiction on this planet, the highest subnational debt in the world. The Fraser Institute put out figures that Ontario has the second-highest combined provincial and federal personal income tax rates in the G7.", "So just in context, a province with the second-largest food and beverage manufacturing sector on the continent, something to celebrate, something to be proud of—but again, how can we continue to maintain that, given the fiscal decisions that are being made within this province, most specifically and recently with the budget that’s before us now for debate?", "To get even more specific, in light of all this, where did the decision come from to cut the ag budget by $28 million? What ag minister would stand up and be proud of the fact that he cut his own budget by $28 million? Maybe the decision did not lie with the present Minister of Agriculture. The rumors are out there—the cut, the transfer, the elimination of the RED fund, the Rural Economic Development Fund. Again, why would we do this? Is there not confidence in our food and beverage sector, our agribusiness sector? The food sector alone purchases 65% of food-related farm production from growers in the province.", "Just to reiterate, the ag budget is dropping to $916 million from $943 million. It is one of the smallest ministries. How do you measure that? Well, one measure is the elimination of the Local Food Fund. We heard so much about local food from the government members across the way. The Local Food Fund is being wrapped up. I raised this in question period. I was told, “Well, it’s kind of being transferred”—I assume what’s left of it, if there is any money left—“to the Greenbelt Fund.” I’m not sure how that helps Windsor or Thunder Bay or Essex county. My riding is not in the greenbelt. Sault Ste. Marie, Huron county, Leeds–Grenville—there is so much of the province of Ontario that is outside of the green belt. There’s no money for them but this Local Food Fund.", "On the environmental front, OMAFRA won’t be seeing any of the Green Investment Fund initiatives in this budget. Five or six other ministries will be. I remain firmly convinced, in the recognition that the climate is changing, that agriculture does have the answer, one of the significant answers for the sequestration of carbon dioxide. I’m not worried about carbon; people talk about carbon taxes. It’s carbon dioxide; let’s talk about carbon dioxide. Forestry: There’s tremendous potential within our forestry industry to sequester carbon dioxide.", "There’s another sore point that I did come across in my travels last week. The Ontario pension: Just to stay with the ag line here, farm operations, those that are incorporated, will have to pay both the employer and the employee portion of this proposed Ontario pension. It’s a payroll tax. That’s nearly 4%.", "Certainly people across the north, across rural Ontario, farmers in particular, will be hit by the climate change cap-and-trade fuel taxes. We already have carbon taxes, essentially, on fuel now. They’re called excise taxes; they’re called road taxes; they’re called the HST. When you put a litre of gas in your car, of the price you pay, 41% of that price is tax. That’s like a sin tax, in a sense. Now, it’s not as high as tobacco—that’s close to 80%—although a very large percentage of people do not pay that tax; they go into the black market.", "Again, there’s a 41% tax on fuel already, and really no bone thrown to agri-business. Fuel is a significant cost of not only putting in a crop and working up ground, but also harvesting, trucking and getting it to market. And for natural gas, again, no mention of assistance for a request for rural, small-town natural gas expansion, other than expanding the tax on natural gas.", "I did hear about the concern from small business. It’s a combination of electricity prices and increases in payroll taxes—in this case, for the Ontario pension. By extension, I was told they’re just not sure, especially the smaller ones, how long they could continue. Will we see more doors closed? More job losses?", "These are the people that are here now, running the businesses. What about those industries that might take a look at Ontario—or in this case, maybe they’re taking a second look. Then if they take a third look, they realize the “made in Ontario” cost of doing business—they see the climbing cost of electricity alone; I hear this on the shop floor.", "Going back to that Ontario pension: Of course, helping people save for retirement is a noble goal, but like everything this government gets involved in, they just don’t seem to be able to get it right. The Ontario Chamber of Commerce would concur with that; 150 member businesses remain concerned that the Ontario pension payroll tax will erode the competitiveness of business. It will reduce the take-home pay of workers and, in their estimate, eliminate something like 54,000 jobs a year.", "Couple that with the high price of electricity—again, there is a subsidy grant for those people who are willing to run their car with electricity, but there’s no grant for those people who can barely afford to run their house on electricity, let alone heat their house on electricity." ],

Agriculture is very important in my riding as well. Yes, there’s a cut in the agriculture budget, which is perplexing to say the least, because agriculture does hold one of the keys to carbon sequestration. But what’s perplexing is the cut, and some of the places where the cut is happening.", "This province used to have two pasture management specialists. What they do is advise farmers on how to grow pasture, how to grow a crop that can graze ruminants, can graze animals. That’s very important, because as agriculture progresses, we have to realize that we need more pasture, more grass to actually sequester carbon, so we don’t have a monoculture. That’s really important. A way to do that is to have someone who knows what they’re doing, like pasture management specialists, of which we had two.", "The province is so worried about greenhouse gases, and what’s their response on small things like a pasture management specialist? “Well, one will do.” One will do across this wide province? We talk about developing agriculture in northern Ontario; the conditions in northern Ontario are much different than southern Ontario. Perhaps the pasture would also be different.", "Again, people who don’t know anything about farming might think a pasture is basically a lawn: “Why do you need a specialist for a lawn?” But it isn’t.

One is that we are living in uncertain times. Ontarians feel that; we all feel that. We detected a concern and a need to know as early as possible what the plan for the Ontario economy was. Secondly, the cap-and-trade which we had announced needed the details released as early as possible so that they could participate in the 2017 carbon auction. So for those two reasons, among others, the budget was introduced earlier.", "Two other points that I want to make about the budget. One is that there has been this criticism that there wasn’t consultation. In fact, there were 20 in-person pre-budget consultation sessions conducted in 13 cities in Ontario—more than 700 people. There were two telephone town halls that reached more than 52,000 Ontarians. There were 500 written submissions. There were numerous online consultations, with more than 6,500 users, through the Budget Talks website.", "Last, and in many ways not least, I want to speak to one item in the budget, and that is that, effectively, students from families with an income of $50,000 or less are going to receive free university tuition. We are untapping a huge pool of talent which, if properly trained and educated, will serve this province well. It is now both the hope for that community and also the means for that community to achieve a university or college education. That is one of the best news items in this budget.

Well, down in Chatham–Kent–Essex, my riding, there is some of the best agriculture land in Canada. We grow corn. We grow soybeans. We grow a fruit called tomatoes. However, we also grow over 500 industrial wind turbines, and you know what? It’s been estimated that each one of these industrial wind turbines takes up at least three acres of land. Now, that’s over 1,500 acres in the Chatham-Kent area alone which could have been used for prime agricultural development and yet has gone to these industrial wind turbines. No pun intended, but this government is blowing in the wind.", "If you look at this even further, and one of the concerns I had—and we heard from the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs talk about the number of consultations. Well, my concern is very simple, Speaker, and that is this: The number of consultations that were undertaken by the finance committee—they didn’t even have a chance to finalize their report and submit it.

All of those people travelled through the province so that people from Ontario could have a say into what the budget could look like. But all of this was pushed aside. The government was not interested in hearing what people had to say. They had already made up their minds. They knew better than the rest of us what was good for us.", "This is insulting. It is disrespectful, and it has been noted. It has been noted in his riding, but it has been noted in my riding as well. Why did we bother? It was not easy in northern Ontario to participate in this. An eight-hour drive to make it to the lonely northern sites where the finance committee came to, and all that for nothing, because what went on at the northern consultation came way after the budget had already been written, translated and put in print.

In my riding of Nickel Belt—people may not think of Nickel Belt as agriculture, but there is a lot of agriculture going on.

That’s getting up there. You can compare Ontario to many competing jurisdictions in the United States. I think any trucker could tell us about that.", "What I heard—and this is again what I saw in my riding—is that life’s getting tougher. People are being laid off, regrettably.

However, as I’ve learned sitting across from this Liberal government, the devil is in the details, and a pretty title does not a strong piece of legislation make.", "If we were going to better name it, it might be fairer to say “hardly any jobs today and likely even fewer tomorrow”—and this is from me, and I’m an optimist.

Since I’m still relatively new, Mr. Speaker, I still appreciate learning the process. I still appreciate understanding how Ontario’s government works, or sometimes how it pretends to be working.", "Back to the budget: I stand in this Legislature on a fairly frequent basis, and I give the government heck from time to time about not being accessible to all Ontarians. We point out when the government shuts down and rushes through debate, and when they spring big new bills on the rest of the Legislature and hope that we won’t have enough time to inform or involve stakeholders. We see that this government’s favourite toy is time allocation, which is speeding up the process and shutting down discussion. We know that this government hates to travel ideas and committees around to other parts of the province, like to my community of Oshawa. The Liberals are quick to point out that people in the north or rural communities can just as easily call in, that they don’t need to have face-to-face submissions, but I don’t think that’s fair, nor do I think that is as effective as having a real person sit across from their representative government and look them in the eye. But from where I sit, that seems to be what this government wants to avoid: interacting with constituents and answering to them directly.", "For the average piece of legislation, there doesn’t seem to be the interest in travelling to different communities. With the budget, however, there wasn’t really any way around it. The finance committee travelled to cities around the province and heard from many Ontarians.", "I decided to sit in on pre-budget committee consultations in Hamilton. I heard from desperate Ontarians hoping that the government would address poverty and social systems. I heard from municipalities with specific requests. I heard from corrections officers imploring the government for necessary health and safety equipment and investment. I heard from Ontarians begging this Wynne government to stop the sell-off of Hydro One. I heard from people talking about our woefully underfunded health care system, and they shared very real examples of how bad things have gotten. Throughout the pre-budget consultations, there were countless submissions, written and in person. They were honest and they were raw and they deserved to be heard.", "I don’t envy anyone who makes decisions around the task of prioritizing such desperate and real needs, but that’s the job. There must be careful, conscientious and responsible calculations and considerations when it comes to sorting through all of the needs and requests from across the province. Otherwise, why on earth bother with the committee process? If the decisions have already been made, then why go through the motions of collecting input from Ontarians?", "I sat in for a day on committee. I watched the government members listen. I heard them asking questions for clarification. I heard them thank each presenter. Then they spent the next week or two continuing to hear submissions. Research was compiling and organizing, summarizing and sorting the hundreds and hundreds of submissions.", "I’ll tell you what I think should have happened next: The committee should have presented its report to the Legislature. All of this information should have been taken under advisement, and then the budget should have been updated to reflect some of that input. However, Mr. Speaker, I’m learning that the process that should be often is not what happens when it comes to this Liberal government’s interpretation of process.", "You might recall that the budget was ready almost two months before it normally would be, and we keep hearing that again and again. So they were ahead of schedule. In fact, it was so rushed, Speaker, that the Premier has had to backtrack on details, likely because they were so hastily strung together that they can’t even withstand criticism—but more on that later.", "As I was saying, this budget came out way ahead of schedule. Why? Why the rush? What’s the hurry?", "This budget is pretty important. It’s the budget for the government of the province of Ontario. It matters. It has far-reaching implications. The ripple effects of these decisions will affect everyone across the province. So you would think that it would be worth taking the time to do it right.", "The budget needed to be written. It needed to be signed off on, translated and then printed, and that takes a while. In fact, I would challenge this government to prove that the final budget wasn’t actually in mid-process while they were sitting across from Ontarians who thought they were being listened to. I’m sure that they will feign indignation at the very thought, but we do know that the budget was signed, sealed and delivered before the committee even had finished its report. The voices from across Ontario had their say merely for show. Isn’t that awful? And we wonder why people across Ontario are cynical.", "So here is our rush budget.

It has got some shiny distractions but very little substance.", "Unfortunately, it continues down the path of death by a thousand cuts.

Shame on the minister and shame on the Premier.", "Speaker, since we’re talking about education, you have probably heard that this budget has been strategically marketed as the free-tuition budget, so let’s discuss.", "Personally, I know where I stand on education. Let’s be clear: New Democrats support easier access to affordable education. Simplifying the student aid system sounds like a good thing. Student groups have been calling for change for years, and we support their work and their gains. But to call this free tuition isn’t being entirely honest. Free-ish might be more clear. There are a lot of pieces that need to be addressed by this government so that students can budget and make plans. Professional program students don’t know where they will stand. What is the cost, the real cost, of tuition? What does this government have to say about tuition caps? In the words of the government, the language around free tuition is “evolving.” We hope that we all have a better understanding of what this government intends. We don’t want it to be a clearish explanation when we finally get it. Students deserve to know how to plan for their futures.", "So we know that free-ish tuition is stealing the headlines, but here is something the government isn’t talking about when it comes to post-secondary education: On a per student basis, Ontario’s universities receive the lowest level of public funding in all of Canada. Ontario has now ranked last on per student funding in Canada for six consecutive years. Also, tuition fees are the highest in Canada. So not only do we want students to have access to affordable education; we want them to know that it is quality education—quality education delivered by qualified and fairly compensated faculty. We want students to be able to afford a high-quality education.", "You know what else, Mr. Speaker? We want them to graduate into a promising and optimistic employment landscape. But for 12 years straight, Ontario’s youth unemployment rate has sat above the national rate. In Oshawa, as in Windsor, our youth unemployment rate is among the highest in the province and in the country. Why don’t we see anything addressing that in this rush budget?", "What we do see in regard to jobs and the economy is the fact that the Liberals project that they will fail to meet last year’s job creation goals by more than 60,000 jobs. So I just want to take a moment to point out that they can’t even meet a target that they set. They made up the number, and they can’t even reach it. So I guess we’re back to stretch goals. But this government’s inability to get it right or even rightish when it comes to job creation and employment has very real consequences in very real communities. Those 60,000 jobs would fill 10 GM centres; that’s a lot of people with families and plans to make.", "In 2015, Oshawa was among the top 10 cities with the highest unemployment rate in the country every single month except for one. Those are real people and real families that we are talking about. It was really, really disappointing that any attention to automotive in this budget was almost an afterthought. This budget laid out automotive as a bottom-rung priority, and we don’t accept this. We need to see a comprehensive and properly designed manufacturing and automotive strategy that will strengthen opportunities in our communities. They’re dropping the ball and, in the process, endangering our futures.", "We know I wear a few hats in this role, one of which is the NDP critic for pensions. When our budgets were delivered to us in the Legislature on budget day, I immediately turned to the section on pensions. Ontarians are eagerly waiting to know the details of the ORPP as this government decides them. A bit of a background: Two thirds of Ontarians do not have a workplace pension. There is a savings crisis and we need to tackle it. New Democrats originally proposed a strong made-in-Ontario plan. Unfortunately, what we’re seeing this government do is slowly but surely limit the potential for a strong pension plan.", "To illustrate: Initially, the Liberals said it would be a plan modelled after the CPP and designed so it could eventually be incorporated into the CPP. There was talk of universality, and then they started to talk about ways to exclude people. Comparable plans went from defined benefit plans to—what we see them now trying to get away with as comparable, and therefore excluded—PRPPs, bank products similar to RRSPs that we’ve talked about in this Legislature that don’t even exist yet. They went from everyone in to a plan that could exclude seasonal workers, contract workers and far too many precariously employed Ontarians.", "We’re going to have much more opportunity to debate and discuss the design of the ORPP, but here’s what I wanted to highlight today. On page 151 of this budget, they have laid out a section called “Collaboration on a National Pension Solution.” It says, “Ontario will work collaboratively and intensively with the federal government, provinces and territories to make progress on a CPP enhancement that addresses the needs of future retirees.” Apparently, it’s the province’s view that “a CPP enhancement must be timely and provide a level of adequacy and targeted coverage that is consistent with the ORPP.” Hmm.", "So, again, this government’s view is that a CPP enhancement must provide “targeted coverage that is consistent with the ORPP.” Pardon? They started this ORPP journey by saying that the ORPP would be modelled after the CPP and be designed to be incorporated into the CPP. Now they’re saying, in their view, that the CPP enhancement must provide “targeted coverage that is consistent with the ORPP.” Now they’re saying that the CPP enhancement should be modelled after the ORPP. They’ve switched.", "I’d like to point out that CPP is a universal program for all—universal for all, not targeted. Targeted would indicate, again, that some will be excluded. For expansion to be targeted instead of universal, it would have to be designed differently, and creating a two-tiered CPP expansion is wrong and attacks one of Canada’s universal cornerstones.", "Speaker, I’m almost out of time, and there’s so much more that is missing from this budget. This government loves to forget about farmers—as we’ve heard—about our northerners and anyone who needs affordable housing. The environment, too, has been laid out as a weak priority. In remarks from one of my colleagues earlier in debate, it was referred to as photo-op environmentalism. That stuck me because that’s just so well phrased: photo-op environmentalism. We will see a five-cent increase in gasoline, but why won’t we see that money go to green initiatives instead of into Liberal pockets? I guess for that to happen, they would have to want to make a difference, not just to make noise and not just make things worse.", "To summarize: I do not support this government or its short-sighted, shallow, rush budget, quite simply because this government does not support our communities.

They talk about more seniors getting drug benefits, but unfortunately, they can’t keep up with their hydro costs either, so they are giving with one hand and taking more with the other.", "Certainly, we do have a poverty issue in this province, and it’s not being addressed the way it should be by this government.

She used an expression that says, “Why are we shaking down our seniors to see if a few loonies and toonies will come out of their pockets?” This is exactly the way they feel. This is wrong.", "When the Liberal government was in campaign mode, they talked about pharmacare. Everybody knows what pharmacare means. It means care based on need, not on ability to pay. It means drugs based on whether you need them or not, not on the ability to pay. This is what they talked about when they campaigned. They touted their Minister of Health as being the one who is leading the charge for pharmacare for the entire country. Come election time, come the budget, they go in the complete opposite direction, where they say, “Well, some of you will be covered.” The number is clear: 170,000 people. They have repeated it 170,000 times. We all know it. What they don’t talk about is that there will be one million seniors, like the MPP from Oshawa’s grandmother, who will have to pay more. That’s wrong." ],

We now have birthing centres, which we just started. I was very fortunate to get one of those pilot projects in a low-income neighbourhood in my community. It’s interesting to me to watch, in the year that that’s been open, how much more control women have of their health and childbirth. Two of the large communities in that neighbourhood are indigenous communities. Seventh Generation Midwives Toronto operates out of there, as do a large number of Muslim women practitioners who are midwives. The cultural diversity in learning that is taking place between different types of approaches to midwifery is really a uniquely Canada experience. That was a major investment by this government into a more progressive approach.", "I’ve also witnessed in the last six years, Mr. Speaker, early childhood education—K4, K5—in schools. We’ve had five years now of early childhood education in Ontario, and the results are astonishing. When you talk to teachers, when you talk to parents, when you look at the scores, those kids now in grades 3, 4 and 5 are doing extraordinarily well. The opportunities that I see for low-income families in Toronto Centre, as a result of kids who haven’t even finished their elementary education, are extraordinary.", "I also have a program, that many of us have, called Parents for Better Beginnings, which is another social policy of this government. I go and meet with them. They’re mostly women. Some of them are from conflict zones where they’ve had family members shot in front of them. The kids have gone through terrible trauma. Many of them are trying to accommodate new cultures into their lives that are very different.", "I have to say, Mr. Speaker—I made a mistake; I apologize—that I’m sharing my time with the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore and the member from Newmarket–Aurora.

As kids get through elementary school—and the massive investments—I’ve got great new schools, like Nelson Mandela. The number of schools that have been repaired in my community is quite extraordinary, and I don’t think it’s different. The real estate in my community tends to be amongst the most expensive to repair, given downtown prices. It’s one of the hardest places to site schools in Ontario.", "Then they get into high school, and then what kicks in? Something that came out of low-income-neighbourhood folks in Regent Park called Pathways to Education. This is a way that students in high school can accumulate savings and financial assistance to help them through all the costs of post-secondary education. It provides mentorship and assistance and has also seen our graduation rate now jump from the high 60s to the low 80s over the last few years. I have kids who would have never graduated from high school, who are graduating with money in the bank and a sense of self-confidence.", "Then this budget added another layer onto progressive politics. You can believe me: I represent a lot of families for whom household income is under $50,000. Unequivocally, university and college just became free for them. I don’t think there’s any doubt about that. So when you think of all the people out there in my constituency, like across Ontario, this is a phenomenal change. I was out in my community last week, as many were, and this is all I heard about—just the simplicity of people understanding a simple number. Then at $83,000, I think the most you pay is about 500 bucks, which is a pretty good deal.", "Quite frankly, if you go to George Brown or you go to Ryerson or you go to any of the universities—U of T in my part of town—they all have top-up programs that help students out with scholarships and stuff like that. So it’s fairly easy for those folks to take what is an extremely low-cost education.", "But this is progressive building.", "Then my friend the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities—I had the great pleasure, under his leadership, of announcing our youth connections program. This is $250 million that is targeted to kids who are having trouble participating in traditional school and education, and gets them connected.", "I am seeing that program all across my community—Yonge Street Mission, dozens of organizations working with kids who are on the margins, pushing them back into the centre of opportunity again. It is a phenomenal transformation.", "I listened to my friend the member for Oshawa and I don’t know whether we live in the same province. I’ve lived in Manitoba; I’ve lived in Quebec. There is no place in Canada where that suite of support for children, from the point of birth with their mothers, through to getting an education for free—where anyone who is in the lower and middle end of income has more supports today in Ontario than just about anywhere else. I lived under NDP governments in Manitoba—some very good folks—but we never had this kind of range of services.", "There’s some income-testing here. People who make what most of us make in this House can afford to pay. I pay for my nephew, who is struggling. I pay for his tuition at George Brown and incented him to do that. His mom wasn’t able to help out in the way that she wanted. We all help out in some ways. Today, I probably wouldn’t have to do that, and I could make investments in other parts of his life.", "On the employment side, there’s this idea that we don’t support over here, which is revenue-neutral carbon pricing. Please explain: revenue-neutral to whom? To us, as the government? If you actually look at it, please find me a successful model. British Columbia is projecting a 32% increase in greenhouse gas emissions.", "The party opposite has a little secret they don’t want to share with us, Mr. Speaker. It’s very hush-hush over there. They love to talk about carbon pricing but they won’t tell you what the price is. We’re telling you what the price is. It’s set by a carbon market, on supply and demand; it will be about $17. You’ll know what it is at the pumps. The model that they’re suggesting is that we have to vote on it in this House.", "To meet the federal objective—which is 14% below 1990 levels, according to all the leading economists—if you use the BC model, which they’re so enamoured with, it would be 160 bucks. Now, what is it in BC? It’s been frozen since 2012, because if you don’t have a cap-and-trade system, you’re relying purely on price. They’ve frozen it because they didn’t have the will to actually set the price high enough to deter greenhouse gas emission reductions. It’s frozen until 2018.", "So what are you going to do? A little transparency across the aisle would be nice. Are you going to vote through a $160-a-tonne price? Because to get any reductions out of it, that’s the kind of price you’re going to need. Are you going to vote through a $30-a-tonne price? That’s still about twice of what we’re proposing, but we have a capped decline rate of 4%.", "And how are you going to help families who have no money? People on low income, unless you’re going to write very big cheques, are not going to get any material amount of money to help them buy an electric vehicle or get a bus pass or a transit pass. We’re providing that kind of direct assistance, much in the way that others did, Mr. Speaker.", "This budget proposes how that money will be spent. It has to be spent in measurable GHG emissions, and we have to report on that, and do that up front. This $1.9 billion may sound like a lot of money until you realize that you have to help every Ontario family retrofit their home, buy a low-carbon vehicle, get low-carbon technology in their home and replace that fossil-fuel-intensive heating and cooling system. It’s not revenue-neutral to most working middle-class families; it’s pretty expensive for them.", "The same philosophy that I just talked about that’s giving all of these families a leg up: Pathways to Education, access at free or low cost to universities and colleges, birthing centres, and youth connections—$259 million, giving young people the ability to get a job. That $1.9 billion, when you retrofit every single building in Ontario—that will be one of the biggest job booms.", "The other thing that’s interesting is that as you insulate all those homes and you retrofit all those buildings, they become less expensive to operate, because you have a more affordable platform. You see that in Switzerland and you can see that in other jurisdictions that have done these kinds of programs, because a net-zero carbon household is one that’s generally generating its own power. You can see in my friend the MPP from Barrie’s town the amazing work done by Royalpark Homes, where they’re selling houses with very low—or almost no—power or home heating bills. The Conservatives don’t support that, Mr. Speaker. They can’t even tell you what the price will be, never mind that it is not neutral to anyone.", "Mr. Speaker, I will turn it over to my colleagues.

Certainly, there have been challenges, but we, as has been proven and shown, are doing better than most. So I was glad to see the budget come in when it came in.", "I know in my riding that we have rebounded from the downturn in auto parts manufacturing. We have moved into high-tech auto parts manufacturing. We have also moved on to other types of manufacturing, whether it be aerospace or else—we’ve diversified, and our economy has come back to a large degree.", "In being out in the community, whether it’s at a birthday party for a 90-year-old—as I was on Sunday; I had an absolutely delightful time—or talking with students at one of our many local high schools, I’m always asking people questions about their future and how they’re feeling today. So I just wanted to make a few comments in terms of what’s important to the people in Newmarket–Aurora in Bill 173. I’ll tell you right off the bat that people are delighted that the deficit has been reduced to the level that it has been reduced to, and that the government is keeping its promise to drive that deficit to zero in the next budget. I think there were some skeptics out there, but I think we’re doing better than where we said we were going to be. The public has noticed that and are quite delighted about it.", "One of the other things that has been well received in the riding of Newmarket–Aurora is the tuition changes and the fact that average college and university students with family incomes of $50,000 or less will be able to graduate with no provincial debt.

As she gets older, her income is more modest, but it’s phenomenal to see the home supports, the improvements in PSWs. Could it be better? Yes, it always could, but I think you’d be challenged to find a place where it is healthier in Canada to be a senior where you have more choices than that.", "I’m also saying that we’ve just governed through the worst recession in the last century almost and out of the collapse of banking. We bailed out the auto sector. One of the members said that the auto sector was on the lowest rungs. How many billions do you have to—I think it’s $6.8 billion to revive a sector that is making more automobiles and contributing more to our GDP than it ever has—more than saved it; it’s exploding. Now we’re making massive investments in electric vehicles and helping monitor that technology. Find a government somewhere in the world that has invested the way we have in the automobile sector, and will, as we move to that.", "I don’t know what the NDP’s standards are, but it must be free trade. We’ll be back at balance next year, Mr. Speaker, which is a phenomenal accomplishment given the massive reinvestment—a phenomenal accomplishment.

There were three things, similar to our party. (1) I wanted to include a credible plan to make energy affordable in Ontario; (2) to include a plan to properly manage Ontario’s health care system to ensure that the services and programs are there when people need them; and (3) to include a credible plan to balance the budget, including immediate action to pay down the debt.", "Instead, we received higher debt, higher interest payments and a rising cost of living. Life is harder for every Ontarian under the premiership of Kathleen Wynne and her Liberal government.", "This is the ninth budget in a row that the Liberals have posted with a multi-billion-dollar debt—at $308 billion, up from $296 billion last year, a $12-billion increase. This is the highest debt ever in the history of our great province. This translates into $22,103 for every single Ontarian. When I look at these pages who have just joined us today—welcome to Queen’s Park. I hope you enjoy your experience. You are in debt $22,103. A couple of my colleagues have become grandparents since we’ve been here. Their grandchildren start off in their life $22,000 in debt. Anybody listening, anybody at home, anybody in this House who understands debt knows that once you get that far in debt, it’s very, very difficult to come back out and actually have money to spend on the things you want, unless you can lower and get out of that debt hole.", "It took the Liberal government 12 years to double the provincial debt. Under this tenure of the McGuinty-Wynne Liberals—12 years—they’ve actually doubled the provincial debt. None of the 23 Premiers prior to them did this.", "Interest on the debt will be almost $12 billion. That’s six times more than what is spent on agriculture, the environment and natural resources combined.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m going to read a list to you. The combined total expenses of the following ministries—aboriginal affairs, agriculture, Attorney General, citizenship, energy, environment, finance, francophone affairs, government and consumer services, labour, municipal affairs and housing, natural resources, northern development and mines, Treasury Board Secretariat, economic development, and tourism, culture and sport—would still not equal the amount paid to service the interest on the debt.", "When I’m in my great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, or I’m out speaking to a group in the public, I ask them the question: “Can you tell me what the three biggest expenditures of the provincial government are?”", "Typically, most people say health care, and they’re bang on, as it should be. Health is the most important priority we all should treasure when we’re here as legislators.", "Number two is education. Again, everyone agrees with that; everyone concurs. It needs to be number two.", "When I ask for number three, most people start to falter. They don’t really want to answer or they don’t know how to answer. Many will say community and social services, the most needy needing those services. No, Mr. Speaker. The third-largest expenditure by this Liberal government is actually payments of interest on the debt that they, and they alone, have accumulated—$12 billion.", "I talk about that a lot because really, in my job, every day that someone comes into my office, or I meet them on the street, or I’m out at a public event—I’m fortunate enough to be out seeing a lot of people—what we have to talk about is what the realities of government are, what services we’re not providing.", "Almost every group that comes through, whether it’s seniors on fixed income, whether it’s people looking for children’s services, like mental health or special needs, seniors who can’t afford their hydro payments, when they come through my doors, what we talk about is where the money is going. They’ve had record revenues over the last number of years, this Liberal government, and yet they still add to our debt, add to our deficit.", "With $12 billion, we could fund a year of long-term care for 222,043 seniors. We could fund 44,120 beds in palliative care units for one year or 40,347 hospital beds for one year, yet we’re hearing about hospitals being closed and beds being closed. We could fund 169,052,488 MRI scans.", "Mr. Speaker, all of those things that I just told you, we’re not getting. You know why? Because that money is going to pay interest on the debt that they’ve accumulated.", "We all have limitations. We all have our own personal budgets, our family budgets, our home budgets, our business budgets. We all know it’s fundamental that you have to be able to run your fiscal house if you’re going to enjoy the things you really want in life. Speaker, the high debt payments are taking money out of public services.", "Again, a few years ago, I was the community and social services critic. It was always appalling to me when I thought of the things—when people came through my doors, in their greatest need, looking for help for their loved ones; when they came through from Community Living; when they came through looking for affordable housing; when groups like the food banks and people like the United Way came through, asking to help those most in need in our society, yet I had to tell them that this government chose to spend money and to add to that burden of debt rather than services that we could be providing. I say to them, “What could we be doing in your backyard, in your service, in your association, if we had $12 billion to the positive and not $12 billion to the negative?”", "Community safety and correctional services: No funding was announced to support the recent PTSD legislation, Bill 163, and yet the government professes that they’re going to fast-track and make this a priority. It’s interesting that they say one thing, but where is the action to follow that up?", "They continue to download court costs onto municipalities. There’s no funding to assist police services when they’re responding to calls where persons are in mental distress. That’s becoming an increasing concern of municipal police forces that talk to me—and our OPP as well. There are a lot of people now calling for those services, and the police are dispatched, with no additional services, to actually come up and provide those types of specialized services.", "Municipal affairs and housing: Not one Small Communities Fund grant was given to municipalities in my riding this year, despite, if you think about rural Ontario, the significant assets and the number of bridges. In my two ridings alone, we have 300-plus bridges that all have to be replaced and maintained, because we have to get the goods and services to market. Many of the natural resources come from our rural ridings—our food, the staple of everything we live on, which has to travel the highways, the bridges and all of that infrastructure that we have; the water, to ensure the safety of our residents; the sewer systems, again to ensure the safety of our residents—yet not one of those communities got it.", "It cannot continue to fall on local municipalities to pick up the downloading because of their poor mismanagement. They cannot continue to fall back on property taxes, because we do not have the population bases to sustain such significant increases.", "Mr. Speaker, on a very specific point, there was no money to boost things like the Wiarton-Georgian Bluffs airport. That’s one of those things that is fundamental to an area like ours, to ensure the safety of our residents and the tourism industry.", "Infrastructure and transportation services in rural and northern Ontario: I was pleased to see the Connecting Link Program revived for vital road and bridge improvements, but transportation continues to be non-existent in our small rural and northern communities. These communities continue to be shortchanged by this Liberal government, receiving $5 million less than almost a decade ago—after the Liberals initially cancelled the Connecting Link Program in 2013—and receiving less than their fair share of the gas funds. Every year, I say in here, “Who spends more gas than you in your riding, travelling around?” Our farmers, our agricultural community, our small businesses need to be able to go those expansive distances to provide the services and programs, and yet we do not get our fair share of the gas tax funds.", "Overall, the costs in almost all walks, in all industries, are increasing. Life is truly harder under Premier Wynne and her Liberal government.", "Last week I was out in the community a lot, and I went into stores. I went into grocery stores. I went into M&Ms. I went into manufacturing businesses, production companies. The apple industry: I sat at a politicians’ meeting, and I talked to someone from the apple industry and the horticultural industry. They had said to the government, “You’re putting us out of business because of your increasing high hydro costs.” They asked for some form of an industrial rate or a special rate.", "Vic Fedeli, our critic from North Bay, Ontario, told the story—and he tells it often—that he was down visiting someone in Chatham–Kent–Essex. They were investing $100 million in a new greenhouse. They were going to create 100 new jobs. Vic was ecstatic. He thought, “This is good. This is something I want to congratulate.” Then the owner turned and said, “And I did it in the States, because you’re uncompetitive because of the current way the government’s going.” Mr. Speaker, that’s a sad story. We have the ability. We have the workforce. We have a proud province that wants to lead our Confederation, but we need the government to turn tracks.", "Drug deductibles for many seniors will nearly double to $170 from $100. A 4.3-cents-per-litre hike in gasoline taxes: Premier Wynne promised there would be no gas tax increase prior to the 2014 election. How quickly they change course.", "A $5-per-month increase in natural gas bills and propane: There’s no guarantee it even goes to environmental needs. This is going to go to a slush fund to cover their mismanagement, their incompetence, their scandals and all of their overspending of the last number of years.", "There’s a 4.7-cents-per-litre increase in the diesel price, thanks to the direction that they’re going in. Again, our small contractors, our large contractors, our farmers, our people out in rural Ontario who actually drive the economy through these—these are necessities, to have vehicles that are going to carry the goods and services to market, and they’re going to pay significantly every time they stop to fill up at the pumps.", "The sin taxes: Everybody knows that there’s an increase in wine and cigarette prices and those taxes.", "In agriculture, the apple industry: I asked this Liberal government in 2014 in this House to invest $25 million over seven years to revitalize Ontario’s apple industry. I’m told by the industry that they can totally revitalize the industry; they can ensure it’s a thriving, sustainable industry; and they can provide all of the apples that we need in Ontario in-house, creating those jobs and creating the ripple effect to the economy, the positive economic impact, the direct and indirect jobs and the opportunity to ensure that this industry thrives. We now have cideries; it’s a healthy food source. Yet I see nothing in the budget about that program.", "Eight years ago, apple trees were being taken out of production in Ontario. Today our apple crop generates $60 million in farmgate revenue, and there’s lots of potential, we hear from the industry. The government is proud to say, “We’re going to support this and we’re going to support”—we just heard one of the ministers talk about supporting the car industry. Why will they not commit to the agricultural industry?", "They often say that it’s a priority ministry. Every other province—I believe every other province in Canada—has actually done an apple revitalization program, except Ontario. Why will we not watch and see the benefit that they’re getting and do it here? I’m truly disappointed that the Minister of Agriculture did not facilitate the development of such a plan and champion Ontario’s apple industry.", "Instead, this government, which purports agriculture to be a priority, and that that’s—in fact, the Premier at one time took this as part of her own personal portfolio. Yet they cut $28 million from the agriculture and food budget and they increased costs across the agricultural community exponentially. This means less for farm families, less for rural communities, but more importantly, less for our province. Our food source is absolutely critical.", "There was almost no mention of agriculture, other than a couple of niceties, but there was nothing there action-wise that actually gave our farmers hope. Many of the people in the meeting that I was at in Elmwood on Saturday morning—there were a lot of municipal politicians and commodity groups. You could see that they all felt the same: This is not a priority of this government, or you would not see—they had no hope that they were going to move forward.", "When I was critic of community and social services, this Liberal government magically found $50 million to cover overtime costs of a flawed SAMS program, and yet they cut $28 million from agriculture, a supposed priority budget item for them.", "We heard concerns at the Bruce County Federation of Agriculture meeting. Farmers are concerned about government rolling out policies without seeking proper scientific evidence, specifically the neonics and the pollinator health, and not consulting with industry stakeholders.", "Rising electricity rates: They’ve added $1,000 per year to the average family. Food producers need an agricultural and food electricity rate; greenhouses need industrial rates; and they have to stop the increasing regulatory burden.", "Seniors in long-term care, which is close to my heart—that’s what I’m currently critic of: I was pleased to see some money in there for palliative care. I was pleased to see some money for dementia and behavioural supports. On the other hand, I was very concerned about the impact overall to most of our seniors. Many of our seniors live on fixed incomes and in medically underserviced rural areas. Instead of ensuring seniors have better access to care and affordable medical drugs, this government is nearly doubling the cost of their prescriptions. Seniors will have to pay substantially more for their prescriptions. The deductible for the Ontario Drug Benefit Program for seniors goes up from its current level of $100 to $170. This reduced access to drugs will contribute to poor health over time and cause potentially much higher cost.", "We hear from individuals saying, “I can’t afford this. I’m making a choice. I’m not going to take my drugs or all of my drugs.” Then they end up in the emergency department, which is the absolute most costly form of health care in our province. I just can’t understand the rationale that they used here. It’s, again, more of that spin, where they want to make it look good—“We’re doing this”—but what they don’t tell you is what they’re taking out of the other pocket.", "There’s a crisis in long-term care in every corner of Ontario: 24,000 seniors currently sit on a wait-list for a nursing bed, a wait-list that we have been told by the industry will double to 50,000 seniors in just six years. The Ontario Long Term Care Association: I’ve met with them and I’ve been briefed by them. I want to understand the industry so we can try to be as supportive as we can. We have aging, crumbling long-term-care homes and 30,000 outdated nursing beds that need to be rebuilt to safe, modern standards. I have been pressing the minister and the associate minister since I took on this portfolio to ask them—to just give me the answers. You committed, in two elections back to back—perhaps a third—that you’re going to refurbish and redevelop 30,000 beds. I’ve asked them a simple question: Can you show me the plan of when and where those beds were planned to be developed? The silence is deafening—a total disrespect and disregard for seniors in our province. How could anyone on that side of the House stand there with any sense of pride and say that we have promised and committed to 30,000 beds and yet you cannot produce something as simple as the plan of when and where you’re going to do them? Seniors’ care is under threat of being rationed by this Liberal government, just as was done with cuts to physiotherapy services for seniors—again, they take away the services and they end up falling, getting more injured and they’re back into a much longer, much more tenuous and much more expensive form of care.", "We are calling on the government to halt the drug cost increases. The Premier stood up and said that they may need to review that; that they may not have done the right thing. We implore them to actually reverse their decision that they put into this budget.", "Safe staffing levels have been brought up by the Ontario Long Term Care Association and the Ontario Association of Not-Profit Homes and Services for Seniors. Both have called for safer staffing levels of care for the clinically complex seniors coming into long-term care homes. They’re telling us that there are more complex needs, there are more challenges within the sector, and yet nothing is in there for increased staffing levels.", "As many as 92% of Ontarians surveyed said that long-term care homes are not being staffed to meet the diverse and increasingly acute medical and mental care needs of our seniors. All they had to do was listen to the industry and to the stakeholders, and they could have made better decisions.", "In my riding, I have a 100-year-old whom I went out and visited a few months ago. She was cut from three hours of care to two hours of care. I’m not certain who in this world can envision a 100-year-old needing less care as they get older, as opposed to more, with no rationale. Again, it’s those types of things that I just can’t fathom, and yet we see where some of the other money is wasted on things that actually are not front-line care and services.", "There was no reference in the budget—and I would be remiss if I didn’t ask the government—about the Markdale Hospital. They committed 10, 12, 14 years ago; they recommitted two years ago. It’s not in the budget. I had a lot of calls saying, “Why isn’t it in there?” There were a few other hospitals mentioned, so I’m going to put faith in this government. They committed, face to face, with the people in Markdale, and said, “We will build that hospital.” I’m told by the executive of the hospital administration that it’s moving forward, and I’m going to hold them every day until I see the shovel in the ground and the first patient wheeled through the doors.", "Compared to the last budget that saw another year of frozen hospital budgets, there were some increases, and that’s good. But what they’re doing is they’re putting a bit of money in—$107 million; that’s a fairly significant amount—but what never gets talked about are those increasing energy and payroll costs. In Sault Ste. Marie, one of the hospitals there actually gave us figures that show that they’re going to have a 25% increase in those two factors. So getting a little bit of funding—after a five-year freeze, by the way—not all is going to be good.", "There was $10 million per year for dementia support and money for palliative care, which, again, I have applauded the government for, and I’m glad to see, at least, a step in the right direction.", "Sadly, the government cut $815 million to physician services, which is further preventing patients from receiving the care that they deserve. Like anything—I’m a recreation director from way back. I believe that you keep people healthy. You’re proactive and you ensure they stay in good health. You don’t always go the opposite way and try to fix them in the most costly form after they get ill or sick. Again, it’s challenging that I do not see that.", "South Bruce Peninsula is identified as an area of high physician need, and yet the minister removed that designation just recently.", "Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, we asked for three things in this budget: We wanted to see that they were addressing debt; we wanted to see that they were addressing front-line health care services; and we wanted to see that they’re addressing the hydro cost. In fact, 85% of Ontarians told them, “Do not sell Hydro One.” There’s a $750-million revenue there that is going to be gone in perpetuity. Where does that come from, Mr. Speaker? What does that fund?", "I’m going to close with one other one. We’ve talked a lot and we’ve heard a lot in the last week and a half about free tuition. The Premier said she has some explaining to do, as it’s not really free. Our leader, Patrick Brown, asked this morning for a definition. We want to know: What is your definition of “free” in clear black and white? “Free” is not just a buzzword at the top of a newspaper heading; “free” should actually mean totally free, which is what they tried to suggest to people.", "We need to ensure that there’s job creation. We need to ensure that money is going to the front line for health care; reducing our debt so we can actually fund more front-line care and services for the great people of this province; and we need to see a government in this budget that was actually thinking of Ontarians, not themselves." ],

That’s the headline, but upon reflection, it isn’t free and the vast majority of seniors in Ontario are going to have to pay almost double for the cost of their prescription drugs.", "We can acknowledge that there are a few steps in the right direction in the budget, as the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound said, but there are a lot of steps backwards, and that’s what we have to take into account.", "One step that really bothers me, I guess, is the continued determination by the Liberal government to continue to sell our public shares in Ontario Hydro. Ontario Hydro is a public asset. It should be held in the public trust. It should always be there to benefit our children and our grandchildren, and it should never be sold to private, for-profit interests.

They have to fight disease, they have to fight insects, and now they have to fight this government. It just gets to be unbearable at times.", "The government depends on the hard-work ethic that farmers have. They plant their crops every year, they hope they get a good harvest out of it and they hope the prices are good. One thing that really is hard on them—it weighs on their minds—is what the government is going to do or not do to them. Certainly, that is something that I’ve seen for many years with this government.", "Agriculture is, I think, the highest-grossing business we have in Ontario.

We made a commitment to those people in those budget consultations that we would actively listen to them and then apply what they had said to this budget process.

I’m going to speak for myself as well as the people I represent—the majority of them, at least.", "I’d like to cut right to the chase: This budget has the wrong priorities and does little or nothing to help the vast majority of Ontarians. In fact, it actively makes life harder for hundreds of thousands of them. This should be called the “no jobs today, probably none tomorrow act.”", "Good, stable jobs are disappearing, especially in my community. People feel worried about their own future and about their children’s future. They work harder; they often commute longer; they try to manage higher accommodation costs and higher debts than ever before; and they spend less and less time enjoying their friends and family. Education, health care, home care and long-term care are in a mess. The costs of electricity and housing are rising relentlessly. And thanks to the equally relentless rise in precarious employment, a vast number of people find themselves without dental or medical benefits, without a pension plan or even without paid sick days. Speaker, the pension plan crisis in Hamilton is brutal, and this budget, like many that came before it, has done little or nothing to fix that.", "Very little has changed under the current Premier, other than the name on the door. The Liberal boondoggles and scandals continue; they may even be ramping up, I’m afraid.", "The catastrophic mismanagement of the energy file, which has inflicted misery on Ontarians and driven industry out of the province, has only accelerated with a sell-off of Hydro One. This government lacked the competence to fix Hydro One so that it could deliver affordable, secure and green power for all Ontarians. Instead, it’s selling off Hydro One to private investors, washing its hands of the problem and removing any lines of accountability. Instead of doing their job and listening to the public and fixing public power, the Liberals listened to Bay Street yet again, and yet again they put private profits ahead of the public interest.", "This government continues to make a virtue of having one of the lowest combined corporate tax rates in North America, even lower than Alabama. Its corporate friends are kept happy, healthy, wealthy and wise, while schools and hospitals and the rest of us are underfunded.", "For the seventh straight year, hospital funding will not keep up with the rate of inflation—not even the rate of inflation. We see the results of this all over our province. Outrageously, First Nations communities in northern Ontario were forced to declare a state of emergency in February because the health needs of the indigenous people are still not being met by the provincial and federal governments. This is a disgrace. It’s terrible. This is Canada. There was a state of emergency in 2016, not because of a natural disaster or an accident, but because of sheer systematic neglect.", "Liberal cuts to health care are hurting patients in my hometown of Hamilton. Hamilton Health Sciences is cutting nearly 100 full-time positions at St. Joe’s. It’s cutting 136 positions at the—mental health services are being moved out of my riding and out of east Hamilton. Those services are a lifeline for people in need, but now the whole east side of Hamilton will be without psychiatric care. Patients will be asked to take the bus for an extra hour each way to the remaining facility on Hamilton Mountain. These additional burdens of time and money will only discourage patients from getting the help they need. RNs, RPNs, social workers, child care workers, technologists, lab staff and many other workers are all threatened by cuts at St. Joseph’s, and they know the impact this will have on their community and their friends. The closure of this east region mental health service is a body blow to my riding, which is the second poorest in Ontario. Poverty breeds poor health, including mental health. This clinic exists to provide community-based support. Instead, we’re asking people to travel an hour each way out of their community to get help.", "This pattern of short-term cuts with long-term costs and consequences is the hallmark of this Liberal government, and it’s occurring across our province in many places. This budget does nothing—I repeat, nothing—to address the great structural problem facing our health care system, which is that the proportion of seniors continues to grow and our health care system is just not funded, equipped or designed to deal with their health care needs. This government just keeps on passing the buck to the next generation and the next government, or hopes that helicopter drops of money from its federal friends will save it from the consequences of its actions, from its lack of vision and from its inability to get its priorities straight.", "I know that many of my colleagues on the other side of the House have honourable intentions. One might question, however, to where the road they’re paving leads. If recent newspaper reports are correct, then the Premier has been obliging her ministers to spend as much time as possible balancing the Liberal Party books instead of managing their own portfolios and attempting to reduce their deficit in socially responsible ways.", "There was a cartoon in the Toronto Star the other week that showed the Premier turning Girl Guides away from her office with a sign reading, “$6,000 For Access.” It was one of those cartoons where you laugh at first and then you want to cry. I did a quick calculation. Since the province’s debt is about to pass $300 billion—and we are all greatly indebted to the Liberal government for that—then if the Premier was indeed to remove the key card reader at her office door and replace it with a credit card reader, and if she were so generous as to redirect those admission fees to the public purse, then she would need 50 million visitors at her office to pay off that debt. Every Ontarian over the age of nine would need to troop through her door, credit card in hand, four times. Although at the rate this government is going, they’d be drafting seven-year-olds and eight-year-olds in time for next year’s budget.", "There are times, even so briefly, where I feel optimism, or at least a little hope. I had that feeling heading into this budget, especially after attending the pre-budget consultations in Hamilton. The speakers were very passionate and so dedicated to exposing injustice and explicitly laying out their community needs that I thought this government would not fail to hear their call and pay them some heed in this budget. But, Speaker, once again the Liberal members of that committee never even had a chance to report back to the cabinet to influence the budget, for this budget was already written, concocted in a smoke-filled room over the holidays, no doubt, with no input from the public. The public interest was not the government’s interest, and this is a terrible thing to say in a democracy—", "Interjections." ],

They would, or should, be ashamed to introduce a budget that was so contrary to the wishes expressed by the people of this province, and they found it easiest to act before the public’s views ever reached their desks. One wonders how often the Premier and her ministers meet real members of the public, because if they did and had an opportunity to hear what my constituents and all our constituents are constantly crying out for, then how could they, in good conscience, act so contrary to their pleas time and time again?", "As one example, what do we as MPPs hear over and over again from our constituents and our municipalities? We hear the desperate need for affordable housing in this province. We hear that not only is there a terrible shortage but that the units already in place are deteriorating to the point of no repair because they have shaved off the maintenance funding for the last 20 years. What was the budget’s response to the overwhelming demand? The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing saw a $20-million cut. A great response. Sometimes it feels like this government reads the pre-budget consultation report only in order to do the exact opposite to what the people want.", "Now I will concede that the government is finally showing movement on the topic of inclusionary zoning, which my colleague from Parkdale–High Park has been demanding for years, but there’s not a penny of extra money to build new housing or repair our existing stock of public housing—not a penny anywhere. Some of these units are actually uninhabitable due to decades of neglect, and there’s no money to turn them into livable homes for the hundreds of thousands of people crying out for an affordable roof over their heads. CityHousing Hamilton can only afford to spend less than half of its annual spending need to maintain its properties.", "I see nothing to protect the steel industry in this province in this budget—nothing. They’re talking a good game. The minister and the other minister and the Premier are talking to their friends in Ottawa, but while that’s going on, the steelworkers in Hamilton are losing their jobs, they’ve lost their benefits, and who knows when US Steel is going to attack their pensions? It’s absolutely deplorable.", "This is a blueprint of what’s going to happen to other companies in this country, in our province. It’s a corporate agenda that’s been going on for 15 to 20 years. I can remember fighting this 20 years ago in Ottawa. I can tell you right now, Speaker, this is just the start of it. When they start attacking the public sector, you’re going to see some real outcries.", "This government needs to be calling in favours with the federal government that they say is so great and their fellow people-in-arms—the same party. Well, if that’s the case, you’ve got a majority government in Ottawa. They should be loosening up the purse strings for Ontario, giving more money back to this province in the proportion of the amount of people we have. The members over there, including the member from St. Catharines, have always fought for fair funding from Ottawa. Well, folks, here’s your chance. You’ve got a majority government in Ottawa. Get them to open their purse strings and send some money to Ontario to help us with all these needs of the province, plus your infrastructure costs, plus all the other debts that you’re racking up. There’s lots of money in Ottawa. Maybe they should start sending it to where it should have been going a long time ago, and that’s Ontario.", "Stelco retirees whose medical benefits have been stripped by US Steel and whose pensions are now threatened are in a state of frenzy. They need help from both the provincial and federal governments—both governments—not just passing the buck between each other, blaming the feds, the feds blaming the province. You’re both Liberal governments; you should do something to help these people.", "Let me give you an example of a blatant disconnect between the public and what they’re calling for. Seniors—well, not only seniors—have been asking for years for better health and long-term-care coverage. There are so many holes in this system that are only being patched over by banknotes from people’s pockets. One of my constituents contacted my office for help regarding one of these holes in health care. His wife had suffered a stroke and was taken to Hamilton General Hospital by ambulance. By definition, this would be described as a medically necessary use of an ambulance.", "While dealing with this deeply traumatic event, an invoice arrived in the mail for a co-payment towards the ambulance ride. In this province, under this government, medically necessary isn’t enough to have your ambulance costs covered either. You’ve got to pay for the ambulance. Some of these people can’t even afford to put the lights on. We pride ourselves on being a province and country where you don’t have to worry about the cost of health care and where you don’t have to worry about your bills, but we all know that isn’t true. How awful for a husband facing this terrible situation to have a bill for an ambulance land on his doorstep when he’s going through that traumatic experience.", "I hear many stories like this every week in my office of mean and burdensome little payments in this system that aren’t covered by OHIP and come right out of their pockets. Did the government do anything for people like him? I don’t think so.", "Instead of reducing the burden on seniors by removing these mean changes, it increased the annual deductible on drug payments by 70%. Seniors earning more than $19,500 a year will have to cough up 70% more for prescription drugs. Why is this? It’s because the Premier calls them affluent seniors. The Premier, who’s living on a six-figure budget, calls seniors earning less than $20,000 affluent. The Premier—presiding over a record sunshine list, handing out six-figure contracts, salaries, bonuses and severance payments to Liberals left, right and centre—is so out of touch, so utterly oblivious to reality, that she called low-income seniors affluent. I challenge any member on that side or any member in this House to live on $20,000 a year. Good luck.", "Speaker, $20,000 a year is not affluent. What exactly would they call Saäd Rafi and the other Pan Am executives with their buyouts? If you compare it to what he got for a buyout, that would be good for about 20 years for a person making $20,000. You can take 20 years of making $20,000 with not even having to get up and go to work thanks to the payouts they give these guys. How would they describe the new CEO of Hydro One and his $4-million annual income? I’d call that super-affluent. I’d call that ridiculous, on the senior side of affluent, affluent today and more affluent tomorrow.", "Let me spell out the truth in language this government would recognize. The Liberal government has broadened the affluence of a select few, and a select few only. This government has been reading George Orwell all too closely in its effort to redefine language and has missed the real point entirely. Privatization is “broadening of ownership.” Precarious work is “contemporary mobile employment.” Low-paying, insecure, temporary or contract and possibly part-time work is “contemporary.” Living from paycheque to paycheque, falling behind in your rent and not being able to afford food is the bright new future in Liberal Ontario.", "Contemporary employment—get used to it. When they describe it like that, you realize that they’re not going to go do a thing about it, and they can’t. They’ve accepted it as a fact, as the structure of the modern economy rather than an ugly injustice that needs to be rectified and redefined. “It’s the way things are,” they tell us. “It’s just the way it is, and you’d better get used to it because it’s 2016.”", "We certainly know that good job creation is out of fashion with this government, because they keep revising their employment targets lower and lower and then missing even their own lowered expectations. It’s pretty bad when you miss your own lower expectations. This budget missed its targets on job creation. This budget missed the government’s targets on GDP growth, on employment growth and on business investment.", "One of the first things they did in this year’s budget was to admit they’re not going to reach the jobs target they set for themselves in last year’s budget. Last year, they actually downgraded their jobs prediction by 65,000 jobs. Year after year, this government talks a great game about job creation. We’ll see more and more people in precarious work.", "While we see good manufacturing jobs leaving this province, and while we see entire communities in the highest figures when it comes to unemployment rates in the country over and over again, yet in this budget the Liberals are pulling back their estimate of how many jobs they will be able to support or create in 2016-17. It offers no hope for struggling families. It offers no hope for young people who are trying to get a start in life. Children are still going to bed hungry in this province. I have 6,000 kids in my area who are going to school without the proper nutrition. That’s terrible. One of the biggest cities in Ontario: 6,000 kids. How many schoolrooms will that fill?", "This government’s performance has been miserable. They don’t even bother to set targets for homelessness and poverty reduction anymore. Their goals are aspirational. Past performance is one of the best guides to future performance, and even the government itself is dimly aware of the history of these failures. By removing goals and targets, it has redefined success and failure for itself, but only for itself—only for its own little bubble.", "We on the side of this House are not fooled, nor are the millions of Ontarians outside facing higher costs and worse jobs, looking at 13 years of tired, out-of-touch, underperforming government that has seriously lost its way.", "One fine example, Speaker—and this is from Hamilton. I had the privilege of sitting on the committee in Hamilton listening to the pre-budget presentations. I heard many sad stories and many wonderful constructive recommendations. We heard about the government’s failure to adequately protect correctional officers, but the most disgraceful fact was that we learned that there is an equivalent—as I said before—of 270 classrooms of children who use food banks in Hamilton. That is an embarrassing, sobering, serious statistic that should leave us all in this Legislature ashamed, because in 2016 we have the solutions for child poverty, but in Liberal Ontario there are thousands upon thousands of classrooms worth of children who depend on food banks. If this government was to live up to its ideals, this would be one of the first places it would start. It would be one of the priorities of this budget, but it isn’t.", "Speaker, I cannot support this budget. It does not reflect the voices or priorities of the people of this province or the people I represent. It was designed without public input or consultation by a government that thumbed its nose at this Legislature and wasted the time of all kinds of citizen panels who sought to speak to this budget process. It has missed its opportunity. The NDP and I will not be supporting it, and the people of Hamilton East–Stoney Creek can very much understand why.", "Speaker, in my closing minute I would just like to put a little bit of reality into this place. I’ve sat here for years and I’ve seen the waste. This government, with all due respect, has had more scandals in the last six years than entire governments of this country in the last 100. That’s unbelievable. That’s unbelievable, and we’re not done yet. We’re not done yet; there’s more coming.", "What I’m saying to you, Speaker, is this: Once this government gets its priorities straight and starts taking care of the pensioners, starts taking care of hospitalization for the people and seniors, starts taking care of the people—instead of working from the top down, Speaker, maybe they should work from the bottom up. The first thing that gets hit when there’s a recession or there’s a lack of budgetary monetary needs are the social programs at the bottom: the schools, the ODSP, the OW. They start hammering the bottom. Yet for some strange reason, the banks, the insurance companies and everyone else are announcing record profits. What’s wrong with that picture, Speaker? What’s wrong with that picture? Are the banks, or the insurance companies, not satisfied with a 50% increase? No.", "A woman comes into my office, toting three kids, with no place to live. She can’t feed her kids. But that’s okay, because the banker is driving a Mercedes and he made whatever—$5 million.", "I’m telling you, this country has got to wake up, because it’s happening in the States too." ],

It reminded me, Mr. Speaker—because he mentioned Liberal fundraising—that there was a dinner held at the Royal York in Toronto—you will recall reading about this—where people had to pay $10,000 a shot to have access to the NDP and the NDP leader. Now, not only that, but they brought in Rachel Notley, the new Premier of Alberta, which, of course, then would attract the oil barons from the west who had offices in Ontario to come to a gathering of this kind. So just as my good friend from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek talked about me not throwing stones in a glass house, I want to remind him of that, when he raised that particular issue. And $10,000: Wow, that’s a big figure. I can remember when the NDP didn’t take corporate donations. Boy, things have changed.", "The other thing that I want to mention—there are a lot of things that are proposed by the opposition. One of my thoughts that has come forward from everybody who’s proposing things is that nobody wants to talk about tax increases—of course, corporate tax increases, which would bring in a minimal amount of money—but if you’re going to make significant changes that incur a lot more costs, there’s going to have to be an increase in taxes. Everybody wants more, but the opposition is not going to raise its taxes except in one specific small area." ],

That’s when it went to translation, so it was written before that.", "The SCFEA committee—the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs—was having its meetings. It travelled around and flew around the province from the 18th to the 22nd of January. It was in Hamilton; it was in Windsor; it was in Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie and Ottawa. Then on February 1 and 2, it met here in Toronto.", "Little did they know that what they were doing was just all a sham. It was all for show. It was all about making it look like the government was listening, and making it look like the government cared.", "All these people, the 146 different delegations that came before the committee, thinking that the government was listening—I mean, this is just not right. They all took time and they took effort to put their thoughts together—and to travel, in many cases, in northern Ontario—so they could be heard. They would naturally assume that they were going to be heard, but it was just all for show, and so much that is the case with this government.", "I think that is absolutely terrible. What can you believe from a government that just goes through the motions of listening and has no intention whatsoever of listening to what the people have to say?

I know the opposition talks a lot about cuts to health care. I don’t know how they have done their math, but when I look at page 282 of the budget, I see $1 billion more for health care and I see a 1% increase in hospital-based funding for operating expenditures. That’s $345 million. I see increases in funding for community care, something that’s incredibly important to my community, where so many seniors have talked to me about that, but also families who are caring for their aging parents have talked to me about that. There are investments in cancer care, in home care. These are all really important investments that will improve the quality of life of people in my community.", "Another thing that’s important, of course, and that we’ve talked a lot about is the change to the Ontario Tuition Grant, something that will provide greater access to post-secondary education for our young people. I know our Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities has been working on this very, very hard, and I congratulate him and our Premier on a wonderful initiative that will help our students access post-secondary and help them achieve an even greater potential in the years to come.

  "text" : [ "—I’m coming to that, thank you; good advice—in support of the budget for 2016. Before I do that, I want to share my 20 minutes with the wonderful Minister of Education, the member from Guelph.", "Thank you to the member across the street there.", "Speaker, this is a budget that has been designed to grow our economy and create jobs. I agree with the Minister of Finance—he has been working very, very hard; he has been consulting extremely at length—that in Ontario, there is indeed room for everyone. There is room for everyone to compete and do business, and to grow; room to learn; and room to help each other as well. I also believe that this budget does just that. I share the Minister of Finance’s belief that no matter which side of the House we are on, we should all agree that what Ontario needs is jobs for today and jobs for tomorrow.", "However, that takes commitment and strategic investment, investment that this government is just doing. That is why I’m so proud to be part of a government led by Premier Kathleen Wynne, who believes in its people.", "But our government is focused on building an Ontario that is every bit as compassionate and competitive. Before I go into some of the details of the budget, I want to make some comments on the budget being seen by the eyes of seniors, and especially my seniors.", "Seniors have been talked about a lot in the House, not only today but in the last while. In answering some of the calls that I got this past Saturday—not this one here; the other one—I had two very wonderful calls from my area, from the Chalkfarm community.", "I answered the call, and I was given the name of Maria. So I give her a call, and Maria gets on the phone. She’s excited that I called her back, and she says, “Now, you tell me, Mario, why I have to pay an extra $170 for the medicine, for the drugs.”", "I said, “You don’t have to.”", "“Yes, I heard people said it in the House.”", "“You don’t have to. Sometimes, especially when we debate the budget, there may be some disagreement, but it is not so. If you have a minute, I’ll tell you what’s in the budget for you and for other seniors.”", "“You can tell me. Take all the time you want because I’m not going anywhere. I’m in a wheelchair.”", "“Okay, that’s fine.” So I start to tell Maria what’s in the budget for her and for other seniors like her in the province of Ontario. Speaker, I have to say that when I was finished with Maria, not only was she happy, she was smiling, because I took the time to explain to her what’s in this budget, let alone in past budgets.", "She said, “How come we don’t know about those benefits?”", "“Well, you know, you’re watching TV.”", "“Yes, I watch TV every day.”", "“But unfortunately, we cannot say everything while you’re watching TV.” I said, “Have you heard anything else about what’s in the budget?”", "“No, only that I’m upset that I keep on hearing there’s $170 and $170. It certainly bothers me because I just make above $19,100.”", "“Okay, Maria, since you have some time, let me tell you what’s in the budget for you as well as other seniors. First of all, home care is important; community care is important. We have added an extra $250 million so indeed seniors like you can receive more care at home.”", "“Oh, that’s good,” she said.", "“About that: You’re saving another $170 because you don’t have to pay for the shingles vaccine.”", "“Oh, I didn’t know that. Okay.”", "“You know that we are investing another $75 million over the next three years in community-based residential hospice and palliative care. Maria, lots of seniors go in those particular places.”", "“Indeed.”", "“We’re also investing another $10 million annually in Behavioural Supports Ontario. That is for initiatives to help residents with dementia.” When I said “dementia,” she said, “Don’t tell me about it. I already know about that.”", "“Well, that’s wonderful”—another complex behavioural and neurological condition. I said, “By the way, Maria, you know that if you have to go into the hospital or someone is going to take you into a hospital, now we have cut down the rates for parking by 50%.”", "“Oh, really?”", "“Really. By the way, for the medicine—for this $170 you told me about—people like you, in your income bracket, some 173,000 Ontarians don’t pay any more than the first $100.”", "“Oh, really?”", "“Yes, Maria.”", "She said, “Is there anything else?”", "I said, “Yes, indeed. As well, we are saving you $70 because we are removing the debt retirement charge.” By this time, Speaker, I can tell that Maria—through the phone, if you will—is smiling. She’s not only happy, but she’s smiling.", "I said, “Maria, by the way, since I have you on the phone, you know there are some other benefits on top of this that you already should be receiving.”", "She said, “What other benefits?”", "“If you qualify, you’re entitled to receive another $500 from the Ontario Senior Homeowners’ Property Tax Grant.”", "“I never got this.”", "“No. You have to declare it when you do your income tax.” She was smiling. I said, “If you qualify, Maria, you’re entitled to another $1,131 from the Ontario Energy and Property Tax Credit.”" ],

She was smiling.", "Also, I said, “One more thing: We threw in another $287 on the Ontario Sales Tax Credit.” She was happy, I have to tell you.", "But the most interesting call was the second person I called. She said, “I know what you guys are saying. I know the size of the House and I know why you’re saying that, but it’s not fair because you’re not being honest with us, especially with our seniors.”", "I said, “How is that?”", "“You’re confusing us because you say one thing. We hear the other side and they say something else. Then we hear the opposition say something else.”", "I said, “This is the debate in the House.” But she said, “It’s not fair. If you can’t say the truth in the House, you should resign.” I said, “Maria”—the other lady was another Maria—“unfortunately, that is not the way it works.” But she said, “You know something, Mario”—we are on a first-name basis. I said, “Look, in the House, unfortunately, we say things that, yes, we shouldn’t say,” but the point was made.", "To go into a little bit more detail—I know I only have one and a half minutes left, so I don’t want to go into the other details. But let me say that the budget itself is about jobs and the economy. It’s one of the most important points that our Premier, since she took office, has been pounding on, putting out money for infrastructure to create jobs for the people of Ontario. When I’m in my riding, I don’t hear any complaints. The only thing that people tell me—they say, “Look, if you want to increase taxes a bit, that’s okay, as long as my son, my daughter and I have a job, as long as we work.” I think that’s the important thing that sometimes we forget: that as long as people are working, they can go shopping, they can spend money, and they don’t mind if they have to pay an extra buck. But they want to see a government that is responsive to their needs, to deliver the care that they need when they need it. They want to make sure that we provide for a good education—and I’m sure that the minister will talk about that.", "I want to dwell a bit longer on seniors, because seniors have been talked about quite a bit in the last while. I think, especially our seniors, we must take them very seriously. We must respect them, because they are the people who deserve all of our attention, on both sides of the House. We should be fair. They should be treated fairly, because they demand it. They are everything for us." ],

I’m going to start off with my own ministry.", "One of the things that we’ve talked a lot about, and that there has been a lot of public interest in over the last little while, has been the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In fact, they had said that we need to teach all students about the history of residential schools, the history of treaties and the history of our First Nations people in Canada. Most of the viewers probably don’t realize this, but that’s material that we already introduced into the Ontario curriculum a few years ago. But, in many instances, it’s optional curriculum; it would be one example in several. So at the moment, we’re going through making sure that all those things that the TRC recommended as mandatory parts of the curriculum will become mandatory in the Ontario curriculum.", "The next problem that we face is that, for many of our teachers, it wasn’t mandatory learning when they took history, when they took geography, when they took social sciences. So, in the budget this year, we actually have $15 million over the next three years precisely to develop resources for the teachers that line up with the new curriculum, to provide professional development for the teachers in the new curriculum so that we can really effectively meet those recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. I’m very excited that we were able to do this in this year’s budget.", "I’m the member for Guelph, and of course, Guelph is a university town. So something else that I think a lot about is university students. When we look at the data, what we see is that students from high-income families are way more likely to go to post-secondary education than students from low-income families. Now, if you look at the data, it is true that the participation rate in Ontario in post-secondary education is higher than in the rest of Canada, and that’s actually true at every income level. In Ontario, it’s already true that low-income students are more likely to attend than in other parts of Canada. Nevertheless, they’re lagging behind, and we don’t think that family income should be a barrier to a student who’s qualified to go to post-secondary education.", "What we’ve done in this year’s budget is we have totally revamped the student aid program for post-secondary. I want to congratulate my colleague the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities for doing an amazing job of really transforming tuition grants in Ontario. I want to start a bit about the way it is right now.", "Right now, there are three ways in which students might get assistance with the cost of going to college or university. First of all, there’s a tax credit. The problem with tax credits through your income tax is that you get them way after the fact. You spend the money and then, sometime next year, you get the tax credit. You don’t get it when you get the bill for the tuition; you get it eight, 10, 12 months later, after you’ve already had to spend the money. Then you get the credit.", "The associations that represent university and college students have said that it’s not really that great when you get it way after the fact. We have the Ontario Student Assistance Program, which is part grant, part loan, but for a lot of that, you don’t actually find out till you’re about to graduate that some of your loan is going to be converted to grant. It’s very confusing. Students don’t know up front how much is actually going to be grant.", "Then there’s the 30%-off tuition program for families under $140,000, which has been quite successful, but it doesn’t apply to everybody; it just applies to students in their first four years out of university. So if, in fact, you’re a mature student who got laid off from the job you got out of high school, and the only way you’re going to find a decent new job is to go back as a mature student, you don’t qualify. If you’re one of those students who didn’t quite know what to do after university and you took a couple of years figuring it out, you don’t qualify for all of that 30% off.", "The student associations have actually come to us and said, “You’re really trying hard to get lower-income people into university and college, but a lot of the programs you’ve got right now don’t quite hit the target.”", "What the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities has done has totally revamped the program, taken all those three programs and rolled them up into some new programs. The really exciting thing now is that if you are a student who comes from a family with income under $50,000, the grant you receive up front each year will pay for your tuition or more. So tuition will, in fact, be free for those students who attend college and university whose family income is under $50,000.", "What about those over $50,000? And I think this is where it hasn’t necessarily been clear. For families over $50,000, there’s actually a graduated grant-geared-to-income system. For people in the $50,000-to-$80,000 family income bracket, about half of those will qualify for totally free tuition. The rest will qualify for a partial grant, and that goes geared to income all the way out to families with $160,000 in income. So in fact, there is a grant-geared-to-income system for all those students from families in the $50,000-to-$160,000 bracket, and of course there are still loans available as well. But what it does do is make sure that, while there’s support for middle-income families, we make sure that the students from the lowest-income families will, in fact, have access to college and universities.", "Now, because I’m the member from Guelph, I must mention something else. We had a very exciting event in Guelph, specifically at the Ontario Veterinary College, on Friday, where the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities was present. This is an infrastructure budget. We’re spending $160 billion on infrastructure over the next 12 years, and we announced that $23 million of that infrastructure is going to the Ontario Veterinary College to build an addition and to do some significant renovations in the surgical and anaesthesia suites. I must tell you that that’s $23 million towards a $33-million project and that people are very excited. As I wandered around over the weekend, I kept hearing from more people who were hearing about this and were very excited that the Ontario Veterinary College will be getting those additions and upgrades to its facilities.", "I’m sure, as time unfolds, that we will learn more about the infrastructure investments. I know that one of the things that has been near and dear to people in the Guelph-Kitchener corridor is the four-laning of Highway 7. That’s a capital project that will be proceeding.", "Also, the upgrading of the GO service from Kitchener-Guelph: In this year’s budget, the number of GO train trips will be doubling for those that are initiated in Kitchener, go through Guelph and stop in Acton in your riding, Speaker. The number of trips in the morning will be doubled, and the number of trips home in the evening will be doubled. That is in this year’s budget, as well." ],

It used to be six weeks to get a renewal done. I have a couple of patients back home who are on medication that needs special authorization. They’ve been on it for years. Usually, the doctor would send the paperwork in and, six weeks later, you’d get a response.", "They are still looking at December’s information. It’s now three or four months of this process being bogged down. Basically, people are now having to pay for the medication because somehow, through this government’s bureaucratic process, they’ve logjammed the system. Whether it’s because they have no money to balance the budget and they’re using this money to offset their costs or they’re just incompetent, I’m not sure which way you go.", "This budget also didn’t touch on the fact that cancer treatment is moving to oral medication. This government still does not cover oral medications for cancer treatment. They’re still using the older treatments—intravenous and injection—and having to utilize our hospital services more often, whereas the newer treatments are oral medications. The Ontario Drug Benefit Program has nothing to do with introducing oral medications. The Canadian Cancer Society sends us emails consistently on this issue, but that wasn’t addressed in this budget.", "Cutting the assistive devices programs: The disabled in our province are being hit hard because this government has been financially incompetent in delivering services.

She gets the uppercut from the private insurer because her husband needs a daily dose of aspirin for a heart condition and a private insurer that she deals with isn’t covering that anymore. There’s the uppercut, and then the right cross comes from you guys because you’re going to double her prescription cost.

The yearly introduction of the budget is a solemn and important part of our democratic process here in Ontario and in Canada, yet it is such a commonplace occurrence that I feel it rarely registers in a significant way outside the bubble of Queen’s Park. So it comes to be taken for granted by the people of this province that the government is handling the budget with responsibility and respect. They have faith in their elected officials to treat the important duty of government of collecting and allocating their hard-earned money with diligence and respect. Unfortunately, I think this government has taken to leveraging the short duration of today’s news cycles to create a budget that has just enough interesting news items to obscure the substance of their agenda.", "Not-so-free tuition is a great distraction from our debt blowing past $300 billion. Unfortunately, we also had the government running roughshod over the consultation process with this budget. They brought forward this budget before the committee had even written its report on those consultations. In fact, even the Toronto Star was prompted to remark that “the Liberal government’s pretense of consultation looks like obfuscation,” and that “the rules of the (rigged) game restrict not only timing but topics.” The fact is, the only thing the government took away from those consultations were opportunities for nice photos and media hits, and it certainly shows.", "While the Liberal government may not be interested, my colleagues and I have been talking to the people of this province. I have spoken to families, farmers, economists, entrepreneurs, blue-collar workers, young professionals, seniors, business owners and even Ministry of Finance staff, and none of them see their interests represented in this particular budget. What they care about is the cost of hydro, how often they are shelling out money for taxes and fees, uncertain employment, wage stagnation and the untold waste they see this government committing with their tax dollars.", "I hear it over and over again in coffee shops and boardrooms, in downtown Wallaceburg in my riding and in downtown Toronto. No one believes that this government is looking out for anyone’s interests but their own and no one trusts this government to execute any of their plans competently.", "So Mr. Speaker, I thought I would take this opportunity to tell the government what I’ve been hearing and put forward some ideas for discussion. There are no silver bullets to solve our financial situation. Instead, experience has shown that it will take a series of ideas, significant structural changes, real economic growth and related employment growth, among other things, to turn Ontario’s economy around and get back in the black.", "Small businesses are the economic engines of our communities right across this province. In January, I spent time meeting with and learning from small businesses across my riding of Lambton–Kent–Middlesex. For me, it’s vitally important to get out and meet with the people throughout my riding and to see first-hand about what is working, what needs improvement and where the government of Ontario can do better.", "Speaker, I got such a wonderful response from those small businesses that I decided to expand on that short tour and engage with people right across the province. I wanted to hear from a wide variety of people and businesses to better understand their concerns and how we could get the government working for them again. Over the past several weeks and continuing for several more weeks, I’ve been meeting with dozen of industry groups, job creators, thought leaders, economists, academics and moms and dads.", "One of the first things I heard was that it’s time to scrap the Drive Clean program. In the budget, we did actually see some window-dressing around this issue, since the government has said they will eliminate the fee for that program. But the testing itself is still in place. People will still be inconvenienced, still have to pay for costly work on their vehicles, still have to go drive around pointlessly because sometimes that’s what the computers need to get a correct reading. And for what? This isn’t an effective environmental program anymore. It’s an arbitrary requirement that is outdated. In my riding, in the community of Lambton Shores, neighbours down one side of a certain street will have to go get tested, while the people on the other side of the street don’t have to. It’s time to do away with this program altogether. The half measure of cutting the fee is great, but it is only a half measure.", "Speaker, I also continue to hear about the estate administration tax, and I’m quite confident most MPPs in the Legislature do as well. I have yet to meet anyone who thinks this tax is fair or makes sense. You may remember that I introduced a private member’s bill to roll back and cap the death tax. Later, our PC leader, Patrick Brown, introduced his own bill, which would have wound down and cancelled the death tax entirely. The Liberals defeated both of these bills, but the problem still remains. I know the death tax is something that everyone is hearing about, as I said. This issue has been around for years, and it’s time this government takes notice and addresses it.", "I also spoke with real estate agents, homeowners and young people who aspire to home ownership. We discussed ideas on how to make it easier to buy and sell a home in Ontario. Specific ideas discussed included capping the property tax at inflation and eliminating the land transfer tax. I believe these important ideas would bring the dream and stability of homeownership closer to becoming a reality for many in Ontario.", "I’m pleased to see this budget hasn’t expanded the land transfer tax, because I know that was a strong possibility, and the minister and the government, I believe, considered that. We need to be eliminating barriers to home ownership, not creating new ones.", "Taxes were something that I heard about over and over again. There’s a feeling that our tax code is outdated and overly complex. One idea that I heard was to immediately form a committee charged with bringing forward recommendations and a sensible plan to begin modernizing, simplifying and flattening our tax code in Ontario. I agree with that idea. I think it’s about time that we sat down and looked at our tax code comprehensively so we can ensure it is optimized and that it represents our priorities. When we add to and take bits from it year after year, it can cease to be cohesive and coherent.", "Speaker, I also heard time and time again about the proposed ORPP. Taking more money out of people’s pockets in the economy today so a government with, quite frankly, a poor fiscal record can take charge of it doesn’t make any sense to people in the province. Why would you trust your retirement savings to a program instigated by a government that paid over $1 billion to not build gas plants, or that took a $61-million loss on the sale of Ontera, a crown agency, and paid more for consultants than it received for the telecommunications company itself?", "The government has been all over the place with the ORPP, first promising to scrap it if the federal Liberals were elected, then saying they were going ahead anyway, and then delaying it for a year. Even after the announcement of the delay, I continue to see ads for it all over the place. There isn’t a clear message on the ORPP. But I can tell you that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.", "The bottom line is that when a government doesn’t consult with the people to create their budget, they create a budget that isn’t for the people. In the end, the policies they have trotted out rest on taking more and more money from taxpayers, and then periodically changing up who gets a small break so they can take a picture and pitch a good-news story.", "The reality which underpins all of this is the debt this government has run up. By their own admission and according to their own numbers, this budget will push the province’s debt over $300 billion for the first time in our history. It has been said many times before, but it is worth saying again, that we are now the most indebted subsovereign borrower in the world. There isn’t a state or a province in the world that owes as much as Ontario does. The interest payments on the debt alone are costing almost $1 billion each and every single month.", "This reality is distorting our economic decisions. It lays a punishing weight on young families and our elderly alike. This government has devised myriad ways to raid our pockets again and again, from raising the tax on alcohol to licence fees to textbooks to gasoline. So whether you are heating your home, filling up the tank of your car, signing your kid up for hockey or going to university, or if you’re a senior who needs medication, your cost of living is going up.", "Life is getting harder, as it has, year by year, for over a decade in Ontario. And yet, as much money as we transfer from our bank accounts to government coffers, the Liberal government’s spending outpaces it. They are mortgaging our children’s future with deficit after deficit, choosing their own short-term gain over our long-term well-being at almost every turn.", "Nine years of deficits, and along the way they have doubled the accumulated debt and driven our debt-to-GDP ratio from 27% to over 40% today, a 48% increase in less than 10 years.", "Thirty years ago, the provincial debt was a manageable $31.5 billion. Nine years ago, it had grown to $153 billion. Today, it has doubled to our current $308 billion. That’s right, Mr. Speaker: In nine years, Ontario’s debt has grown by more than 100%, the highest rate of debt growth of any provincial government in the country. Obviously, this trend cannot be allowed to continue. We simply cannot afford it.", "But instead of spending responsibly, the government raids a contingency fund, sells off our assets and raises taxes. Even after they have picked every available pocket, the debt will rise to $308.3 billion. Our interest payments are expected to rise to $13.1 billion per year by 2018-19.", "I believe that until Ontario’s poor financial state is properly addressed, the government will continue—and will be forced—to cut funding to doctors, to close much-needed schools like demonstration schools in our part of the province down in London, and to raise hydro rates to make up for their financial shortfalls.", "I introduced the Capping Ontario’s Debt Act, Bill 168, a few weeks ago. If passed, my bill would amend the Financial Administration Act to implement a provincial debt cap that prevents the government from raising or borrowing money if the effect of doing so would cause Ontario’s net debt to exceed 45% of its GDP.", "Speaker, Ontario taxpayers are demanding a credible plan to balance the books and pay down the debt. This is an important conversation that we have to have as a province. Unfortunately, we see a finance minister and a Premier trying to distort this conversation by talking about the deficit as if it were something to be proud of.", "The National Post explained this phenomenon well: “Ontario has had a deficit for so long, and at such a size, that it has managed to change the very meaning of ‘success’ as it pertains to such shortfalls. In Ontario, ‘success’ only requires beating whatever target the government sets for its annual shortfall. Since they set the projection themselves this isn’t hard to do....", "“Imagine wandering into your bank, waving your latest credit card statement, which shows that after a decade of trying you still haven’t managed to pay off the balance. In fact the balance is growing like an out-of-control tumour, and eating up more money than almost any other expenditure. ‘Hey, look,’ you boast, ‘it’s not as bad as I thought! I thought they were going to seize my car, but I may still get another month out of it!’”", "Another distortion we see in this conversation, Speaker, is that the Liberal government never distinguishes between spending and investing. It may come as news to some across the aisle, but the words “spending” and “investing” are not interchangeable. It isn’t investing in our economy when there is no discernible return on investment, no proof that it will create efficiencies or boost productivity. When the spending is financed by taking money out of the pockets of families and investors, as is the case with their cap-and-trade scheme and the ORPP, we are kneecapping our economy and limiting growth.", "This government thinks they know what to do with people’s money better than they do, and that a small, elite group is better equipped to make decisions about what an individual’s or family’s priorities should be. Yet the Liberal government track record proves they are patently unqualified to do this.", "The Auditor General highlighted this tendency of the government in her investigation of the Ministry of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure, where hand-picked companies are invited to partake of subsidies and no one bothers to track whether the jobs they create are long-term or whether the so-called investment achieves anything else. In the Auditor General’s own words, “The Ministry of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure ... has not attempted to measure whether the $1.4 billion it provided to Ontario businesses since 2004 actually strengthened the economy or made recipients more competitive.”", "In addition, Mr. Speaker, the ministry’s new strategic investment framework does not include a plan for how to measure outcomes from future economic development and employment supports. Or we can talk about how this government does not track the total funding that ministries and agencies invest in research and development—over $1.9 billion given to universities over the past five years—and doesn’t evaluate the impact of that research.", "This government keeps throwing money around, but they just can’t get anything right. They’re nickel-and-diming the families and small businesses of this province, collecting taxes and fees from hard-working people who are struggling with their hydro and grocery bills, and then they fritter this money away without bothering to check if it did any good at all. We desperately need an alternative to the Liberals’ top-down, big-spending, government-driven approach. People are sick and tired of hearing about the Premier’s aspirations and stretch goals. They’re sick and tired of scandals and poorly run programs.", "Speaker, what we need to see in this province—what I would like to have seen in this budget—is a bottom-up productivity program which encourages the efficient use of capital and isn’t rife with subsidies that distort investment decisions. Instead of paying profitable companies to come to Ontario, we should be creating the conditions that entice businesses and bolster the companies that are already here. Frankly, I don’t see any movement in that direction from this government.", "This is a budget that firmly establishes that they intend to trudge on with the status quo at a time when it’s clear to everyone that change is desperately needed in the province of Ontario. The debt and the cost of servicing the debt are going to continue to crowd out vital services. I should put it on the record again, Mr. Speaker, to remind the government that every man, woman and child in the province now owes $22,000 each, through no fault of their own, quite frankly. I think of our family: my wife, Kate, myself and our daughter. Our family alone is responsible for $66,000 in Ontario debt.", "Of course, we know that tomorrow we’re going to see a big-spending, big-taxing federal budget in Ottawa, which is only going to compound the fiscal challenges that we have in our province.", "To be clear, Mr. Speaker, I will not support this budget. I won’t support a budget that makes our province more unaffordable, uncompetitive and unsustainable.", "I’m proud of the work of our finance critic, Mr. Fedeli, the member from Nipissing. I know he was on SCOFEA as well, and he went around the province with the member from Haldimand–Norfolk and other caucus members.", "It’s just really disheartening when we see a story like we saw today, where they faked, quite frankly, the consultation process. They tried to fake the good people of Ontario. We often see this: When a government has been in power for as long as this Liberal government has, they completely lose touch with the people that they represent. I feel the decisions that they’re making are just so out of touch with what the people out there want. I’ve only been here now for almost five years, but I sense that we have a government that’s living in this Queen’s Park bubble. If they’re talking to the people in Ontario like I’m talking to the people, and my colleagues—there are big problems in the province. They can’t ignore, as members of this government, the expensive energy bills that they’re hearing about. People are choosing, like the member from Nipissing says, between heating their home and putting food on their table—and hydro bills; sorry—and I think it’s very unfortunate that Ontario has come to this place because of intentional decisions by this government.", "As I said in the beginning, there have been announcements by the government, like the not-so-free tuition, but that’s just a distraction from the huge challenges of this debt that we have in the province. They’re ignoring the $308-billion debt that we have, and I hope they come to their senses before they pass this budget to deal with this problem.", "Mr. Speaker, it was great to speak to the budget bill today.

If we stand up, Maria, and we say, “They pretended they listened to you, but they didn’t really, because they had already sent their document out for translation,” that’s the truth. There’s no lie there; that is the truth. They pretended they were listening when in fact they had already made up their minds.

One of the seniors who was there told me his teeth were falling out, but he is living on such a low pension that he can’t afford to go and have dental work.", "There were also injured workers at this meeting. Some of them are retired injured workers who retired much earlier than they would have liked to and ended up on OW or ODSP. They’re still fighting their compensation claims. They have no pension. They talked about the ORPP and they said that the ORPP isn’t going to do them any good and it isn’t going to do anybody who is on compensation or on disability or on Canada pension disability any good because none of those people will be paying into that pension plan. So for anybody who’s really vulnerable and struggling today, it isn’t going to help them anyway.", "Many seniors are supporting their adult children. Their kids can’t get a job because their kids are in that “contemporary mobile employment” that the member from Scarborough talked about. It’s that new sexy word for precarious work. So their kids can’t get a job, they can’t leave home. And in many cases, they’re raising their grandchildren, too. Some of them are raising their grandchildren full-time, with the parents of the kids not even being there, and they’re doing this on $25,000 a year.", "Henry, who was at this meeting, told me that he didn’t believe that selling off Hydro One was a good thing for seniors. In fact, they’ve seen their hydro bills increase by 30% over the last year. They need to make a choice now: “Am I going to heat the house or am I going to buy food? Now, am I going to buy my drugs? Am I going to get my prescriptions or buy food or pay the hydro bill?”", "They don’t believe that it’s a fair choice to make and they don’t believe that private benefit costs—some of the seniors who retired had benefit plans, like the steelworkers, who have now lost their benefits that, I might add, they negotiated and they gave up wage increases to have those benefit plans in place for a secure retirement. After giving up those wage increases as the alternative to those benefits, they now find they have no benefits.", "So some of them are being offered private company benefit plans, but the seniors I met said they’re too cost-prohibitive—$200, $300 a month minimum, and they escalate each year as you get older, regardless of the usage. So that is a problem for them.", "Lena, a USW retiree—actually the member from Stoney Creek probably knows her—told me about a woman who she knows who’s on post-chemotherapy drugs, and the injection is $1,500 a month and it is not covered. She’s a senior, and it is not covered in the provincial program. So she has to come up with $1,500 a month for this drug. So she has to make choices, as well.", "Many of the seniors—both there and in St. Catharines—talked about the delisting of drugs off the list, which continues every year to be a problem, and the fact there’s a drug shortage and that drug companies aren’t being held to account to produce those drugs because they’re not profitable anymore, because there are more expensive drugs on the market that they want to sell and they don’t want to make those drugs any more. But nobody’s talking about how that impacts the seniors in our community.", "I also met with Georgina Lebon, who is a former federal employee. She’s on the Council of Canadians. She’s a federal retiree. She talked about the people she works with on a regular basis. There was one senior man there—this story was very telling. He’s still working. He’s 65, and he is not in a job that has a pension. So at the end of the day, he’s going to be on OAS, CPP and the guaranteed income supplement. He talked about waking up every morning worried, worried every day about how he’s going to live at age 65 without any pension. He says, “When I wake up in the morning, I say, ‘Fudge, I’m awake; I’d rather be asleep,’” because he is so worried, day in and day out, about living in poverty in his senior years.", "Malcolm Buchanan was at the meeting as well. He’s the president of the union retirees. He’s a retired teacher. He talked about living very comfortably in his retirement years, because teachers invested 13% or 14% of their income into a pension plan. But we see today, with many of those public pensions, that the government is trying to negotiate them away, right?" ],

Yet there was nothing in that budget to address the 30,000 beds that they promised two elections ago. We know those beds are not even touching what the new need is going to be. There are 24,000 seniors on a waiting list, and they’re predicting—by the Ontario Long Term Care Association—that that will double to 50,000 in just six years.", "She talked about the cost of drugs and the doubling, almost, of the cost to those seniors, and again a significant challenge to many of them that we’re going to have. I had a news conference here last week where we had the Ontario seniors’ association and the Ontario Association of Non-Profit Homes and Services for Seniors. They were very, very concerned about the impact of this budget on seniors that they so loyally represent.", "Mr. Speaker, we talked and the member for Welland talked as well about the debt that this government has incurred: $12 billion a year. I just want to reiterate for the record: $12 billion, if we had it in a bank account rather than paying interest payments, could fund a year of long-term care for 222,043 seniors; it could fund 44,120 beds in a palliative care unit for one year; it could fund 40,347 hospital beds for one year; or it could fund 169,052,488 MRI scans.", "It’s deplorable that this government continues to come out and pat themselves on the back. They’re hungry to stay in power. They’re going to tell people what they think they want to hear, but the regret is, as an opposition member, that we need to hold them to account because they have run our province into a very challenging fiscal hole." ],

We are seeing it each and every day. My dad right now is in a hospital in Kitchener; he’s in St. Mary’s hospital. When he was admitted over the weekend, the doctor on call said, “Do you have coverage for medical benefits?” My stepmother still works, and he said, “Well, then if you have benefits, you can get the good blood thinner.” I mean, “the good blood thinner”; so there’s a more expensive version and then there’s a cheap version. But the thing is that we’re all the same and we’re all supposed to be supporting a universal health care system, and yet for seniors in the province of Ontario, they see their rights as seniors being whittled away. They’re living it, so it doesn’t really matter what the advertising says.", "This government has an advertising issue. The Auditor General has identified that. Even over the last week, we learned that this government paid $6.2 million in legal fees to sell off Hydro One. This government advertised $600,000 worth of commercials on the ORPP, so that adds insult to injury to these seniors because they see that they’re not going to benefit from it. They see right through this government.", "I think that the member from Welland actually identified this very clearly and brought those voices to this place, and that is her job.

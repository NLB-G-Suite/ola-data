  "text" : [ "It’s a real honour today to stand to talk about the budget, government motion number 20. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to be a part of this government, which has brought forward what I believe is probably the best budget that I have seen in the almost six years that I’ve been here in the Legislature. When we look right across the country, North America and around the world, Ontario is a jurisdiction that is positioned for real success.", "This is the first balanced budget since 2008. We know what happened back in 2008-09. We had the worst economic recession since the Great Depression here in Canada. We had to make a strategic decision as a government. We had to decide if we were going to follow other governments around the world and make cuts and go to austerity measures, or to make massive investments.", "I just want to say, I will be sharing some of my time today with the Minister of Housing.", "We made a decision back in 2008-09 to position ourselves for success in the future by making the right types of investments into things like infrastructure, making investments into education, both JK to 12 and also post-secondary, and really investing into our economy.", "Without question, we’re seeing the rewards of those investments a decade later. The unemployment rate here in Ontario is at 5.8%. This is the lowest since 2001. Our economy has grown substantially. We’re outpacing G7 nations. It’s actually quite interesting; if we look at the average annual per cent in real GDP growth from 2014-16 and compare ourselves to Italy, Japan, France, all of Canada, Germany, the US, the UK—Ontario is at 2.6%. Our closest competitor on that list is the UK at 2.4%. So we’ve done quite well. We’ve built our economy. We’ve built the base necessary to continue to grow. If you look around the province, you don’t have to be an economist to understand that there’s growth here in Ontario. You can see it all around us.", "Our employment numbers are up. Since the recession, Ontarians have created almost 700,000 new jobs. This is quite remarkable. If you compare what’s happening here in Ontario to other jurisdictions, there is no question that we’ve outperformed most jurisdictions in North America and around the world.", "We’ve made a strategic decision to continue to invest—into health care, into education, into infrastructure—because we know that this is a good place for us to make those types of investments. And I just have to say—and this is an important piece—we could have made a decision to make cuts and to cut back in health care, to cut back in education. We decided not to do that.", "If you compare our track record to other governments like the Harper government that made massive cuts—I was involved in the literacy and basic skills sector. The first cut was about $17 million across the country in literacy and basic skills. When you think about literacy and basic skills, that’s one of the areas that you need to invest more into, to make sure that people have the right types of skill sets in order to embrace the new economy.", "Even though the Harper government went into massive debt—I believe it was a $54-billion deficit—they continued to make cuts in many, many areas. They weren’t investing in the right places. When you look at, for example, our track record as a government in comparison to previous governments, even during the worst of times we made the right types of investments in order to help continue to grow the economy, and we’ve seen many rewards from that.", "So, with a balanced budget, we now have the opportunity to make even more investments into the areas that Ontarians value, areas that align with their value sets, like health care and education. We’re going to make an additional investment into health care, an $11.5-billion investment into health care over the next three years. When I was in my community and talking about the budget—the member from Willowdale and myself did a budget breakfast—this was an area that people were so proud of: the fact that, as Ontarians, we could make the right types of investments into health care. This was something that I was very proud to present to my community.", "Within that health care investment, there is an area of investment that is particularly focused on young people. I know many people have called my office to talk to me about this investment because they see it as something that’s good, and it’s gotten a lot of media. I still need to mention it because I believe that this is probably one of the proudest investments I look at, as a government, that we’ve made in the last few years.", "As the Minister of Children and Youth Services here in the province of Ontario and as a former school board trustee, but also as a father, as an uncle and as a neighbour to many families that have children—the fact that we’ve made this historical investment into providing medicine for young people 24 and under. To me, it’s one of those things that you do as a politician, and one day we’ll all walk out of this building and we’ll leave this behind. It’s one of those things that I could look back at and be proud of as a government, as a politician, to make those types of investments, because it speaks to my value set as a Canadian. I’m hoping that we could leverage this and continue to build a national pharmacare system here in this country that’s aligned with our universal health care system so all people have access to medicine.", "This actual investment will cover over 4,400 drugs for young people. Imagine, you have a young person—I grew up and I had a pretty severe case of asthma. My father and my mother were both blue-collar workers. My mother cleaned buildings; my father fixed washing machines. That type of medicine can add up. If you don’t have medical coverage, you can have inhalers that are over $100. Imagine a jurisdiction in the world where a young person can walk into a pharmacy with a prescription in one hand—obviously with their parents with them—and their OHIP card in the other and get that prescription at no cost.", "This is something that I hope the NDP, who have always stood up for the little guy—they’re always there saying that they’re standing up for the little guy. I hope when this budget comes forward in this House and it’s voted upon, that they will stand with us to make sure young people here in the province of Ontario have the opportunity to get the medicine that they need and they deserve so they can live long healthy lives and contribute back to society and reach their full potential, because we know if you don’t have the right type of medicine, how can you perform well in school. How can you perform well in life? I’m calling on the NDP to support this budget this year because of this big game-changer. It is a huge game-changer. This is something that is going to change the status quo not only here in Ontario, but I think is going to set a bar that other provinces and territories may look at to try to achieve.", "I don’t know if the Conservatives will be supporting this. I’m not sure if they’re very supportive of this. I haven’t heard their public position on this. I’d be very interested to hear what the leader of the official opposition thinks of this particular piece within the budget. But if the Progressive Conservative Party here in Ontario believes in supporting young people, believes in supporting families, believes in building the type of Ontario that we can all be proud of, I call on them to support this budget, because this is, again, a game-changer.", "We’re going to make more investments into health care. We’ve got an Ontario dementia strategy. We have a strategy to help people live at home longer and improvements in maternal care.", "But in addition to those great health care investments, we’re going to make more investments into education. As a former school board trustee—and you know, what I love about this side of the House is that you’ve got school board trustees all around. I’ve got a lot of school board trustees around me. The President of the Treasury Board is a former school board trustee. The member from Guelph is a former school board trustee, and of course, we have—" ],

Madam Speaker, I’m not going to pull you into this debate, but I just need to mention that you and I served at the Toronto District School Board, and we know how important it is to continue to invest in education.", "I’m so proud that we’re going to continue to invest in schools; we’re going to build more schools. You constantly hear the opposition talk about how we’re closing schools; we’re closing schools; we’re closing schools. Then the Minister of Education, who sits right here, has constantly reminded them that we’ve built over 800 schools since we’ve been in power. There’s an additional $16 billion over the next 10 years that will be invested into building schools—$1.2 billion for school repairs and renewal over the next two years as well.", "There’s more work to be done. Yesterday I was in Timmins, Ontario. I met with the chiefs from the First Nations that are part of northern Ontario. I listened to them, and one of the issues that came up was education. We have $200 million that will be invested into indigenous education over the next three years.", "We’re going to continue to reduce class sizes. People will forget that this was the government that reduced class sizes, that invested in full-day kindergarten—which on average saves a family, if they have one kid in full-day kindergarten, over $7,000 in child care. So we’re the government that keeps investing into education.", "The Conservatives stand in this House like they’re the defenders of education. Well, I’ll tell you this. If you want the best indicator to compare our success with their success when it comes to education: We’re at the highest graduation level in the history of this province, over 85%. When the Conservatives were in power, do you know what that number was? One in three young people in this province did not graduate high school. Now, think about that. Think about that for one second. One in three young people in this province didn’t graduate high school. How do you expect to build a strong economy—the Conservatives always talk about building a strong economy—here in the province of Ontario if young people are not even getting the skills they need to move forward?", "This is why we have many school board trustees on this side of the Legislature. The Premier talks about this all the time, that Mike Harris, his policies and his attack on education activated something deep in the hearts of Ontarians that spoke to the values of Ontarians. It got people like Liz Sandals, the member from Guelph; the Premier; myself—and I’m not going to bring you into the debate, Madam Speaker—but someone like yourself to get involved in public education. I’m so happy that we’re going to make that investment.", "Now, I’m going to talk about one more thing when it comes to investments in education before I turn it over to the Minister of Housing, because I’m taking up all the time; there are only a few more minutes left. Do you remember when I talked about being able to walk out of this Legislature one day and reflect back on what I was a part of? One of the key pieces for me as a politician, as the member responsible for Don Valley East, but also as a parent, an uncle, a neighbour and someone who believes we need to empower young people in this province in order to continue to build a strong province is knowing that the investment we make into the young people in this province is the best investment we could make as leaders here in the Legislature.", "The investments we’re making into post-secondary education and the initiatives that we have—we started with 30% off tuition because we listened to people. They said that the cost of tuition was becoming a deterrent to people actually attending school. So what we did is we said, “Okay, we’re going to cut it by 30%.” We did this a couple of years ago.", "But we went further than that. Last year, we announced that starting this September—so this September will be the first group of young people entering post-secondary education without paying the tuition fee. The government of Ontario—I should say the people of Ontario will be investing in those young people, because those are the young people who will drive innovation in the future and will continue to build this province up. I believe the number, and I may be wrong, is roughly 200,000 young people this year—" ],

I never really ever thought that I would be an MPP here in Toronto at Queen’s Park. I didn’t have any plans to do that. But when I started out as a town councillor, people started saying to me, “You’d make a good MPP.” I said no a number of times, until I met Premier Kathleen Wynne. She talked about her vision for this province and, frankly, got me very excited about the potential of what this place could do for the people of Ontario from all walks of life, of all ages. I’m here because the people in my riding agree with her vision, and our vision, of where Ontario should go.", "That’s why I’m so delighted with this budget. This is the seminal budget, I would say, of my time here at Queen’s Park.", "The speaker before me touched on so many things, and I’m in absolute agreement with him on all of those. I’ll just touch on two things that impacted my residents.", "The first is the OHIP+, the pharmacare for youth and children. Speaker, there has never been an issue in my riding where I have not been contacted, phoned, stopped on the street—I was in my local drugstore just last Saturday, and I had a druggist who I hadn’t met. One of the pharmacists actually got out from behind the counter and chased me down before I could leave, to tell me how fantastic this program was, because the worst part of her job was watching people hear the price of some drugs for their child—or youth, of some drugs that they had to pay for—and they walk away because they can’t afford it. That is changed with this legislation, provided that it goes through. I’m assured that it is such good legislation that all three parties, obviously, will support it and we’ll get it through.", "Now, I am the Minister of Housing, and there are a lot of provisions around housing here. We’ve spent a lot of time talking about the affordable housing act. I know that one of the things we hear constantly is around rent control, and that’s good." ],

The Premier made a commitment four years ago, when she became the Premier, that the challenge was going to be to balance the budget. Why was that such a huge challenge? Because not until we get the budget balanced are we able to spend on matters that perhaps we were having some difficulty with because of the financial constraints. We balanced the budget, notwithstanding that financial constraint of a deficit. We balanced it in a fair way, over a period of years, without slash and burn. We preserved essential services. We added items that the public expected and needed. But at the same time, we drove towards the target of a balanced budget and we achieved that. Now that we’re in balance and the handcuffs are off, so to speak, we have a little more flexibility in what we can do.", "The other personal favourite, on behalf of the ministry that I represent, the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, is the $200 million over three years that will be spent on First Nation, Métis and Inuit education.

In 14 short years, since this government has been in charge of the province, they’ve doubled the province’s debt to $312 billion. Can you imagine a legacy like that? These are massive numbers. To put it into perspective, every person in Ontario, including your kids and grandkids, now owes $22,300 plus interest to Ontario lenders. What a burden to put on the next generation of Ontarians. That’s about double from 2004, when it was $11,000. That’s the Liberal record: putting an enormous, enormous weight on the backs of the next generation.", "We will also pay nearly $12 billion each year in debt-servicing costs—$12 billion. That’s roughly $1 billion a month in interest costs despite historic low rates. We’re spending more servicing the debt each year than we’re spending on all transit and provincial highways; more than we’re spending on the Ministry of Children and Youth Services, which includes autism services for our children and youth; more than on care for our seniors; more than investments in our post-secondary education system. We spend more on interest than supporting our northern communities, and that was very apparent yesterday at the northern mayors’ conference. We spend more interest than on our vulnerable indigenous populations, and that’s not right. The debt erodes the very services that Ontario families depend on, and places a burden on future generations that they don’t deserve. And when rates rise, our debt-servicing costs will rise even higher. It’s not ideology that bankrupts governments; it’s the math of rising interest costs, and this government has been oblivious to that.", "Basic economic principles teach us to borrow in bad times and save in good times. We are in the ninth year of economic recovery, but Ontario has kept borrowing. This is a government that has an addiction to debt, an addiction to borrowing. There is no new policy they look at where they don’t say, “How can I borrow more? How can I get more debt on the backs of Ontarians?”", "British Columbia and Quebec have balanced their budgets for several years and have set aside funds to pay down debt.

This is a government that is out of sight, out of mind, and they think that Ontarians don’t notice. But when you are the most indebted subnational government in the world, people start noticing. We owe more in Ontario than any other province or state.

Remember, on the watch of this government, hydro rates have skyrocketed 400%. Instead, their hydro scheme is a band-aid solution that does nothing, that punts the problem down the road. Borrowing is not a plan. Borrowing money on the backs of ratepayers is not a plan, and this does nothing to address the root causes of the crisis.", "The day after the Wynne hydro announcement—their borrowing plan—they pushed ahead with signing even more expensive green contracts. They’re borrowing money to pay for their old bad contracts. And what do they do the next day? They sign more contracts. It’s unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable.", "The Wynne Liberals continue to plow ahead with the fire sale of Hydro One. One thing I hear all across the province is, “Why are they doing this?” Over 200 municipalities have passed resolutions saying that this is short-sighted. The Financial Accountability Officer has said it’s short-sighted. At the northern conference yesterday, northern municipalities were saying that this is not in the best interest of northern Ontario.", "Yet, they keep on plowing ahead. It doesn’t matter about public opinion. It doesn’t matter what the legislative oversight is saying. It doesn’t matter what leaders across Ontario are saying. It’s the Liberal way or the highway. They’re actually burying, hiding the costs of their so-called fair hydro plan in OPG’s budget, so they don’t have to include it in the books this year.", "What we see in this budget is that this is all about the election cycle, pushing the problems down the road. Are they dealing with any of the structural issues: the bad contracts, the over-generation, the excessive salaries? Absolutely not. I have been up many times in this Legislature saying, how is it possible that we’re paying the Hydro One CEO over $4.5 million, when everywhere else in Canada you have hydro CEOs that make one tenth of that?", "In Quebec, they have hydro rates one third the rate of Ontario, and their CEO gets $450,000, but this government, this out-of-touch Liberal government, thinks it’s okay to have executive salaries that are completely out of whack. They’re not watching the dollars. And no wonder they’re not watching the millions and the billions, because they’re oblivious to what this means for ratepayers. They just keep on passing it on, signing more bad contracts, giving out more huge salaries to executives—and they pass it off to ratepayers.", "That’s on the issue of hydro. It was very disappointing that the budget didn’t address any of the structural issues.", "This budget also didn’t address the real crisis we have in housing.

In October 2016, Premier Wynne called the housing supply problem a myth—a myth. How out of touch are they? Their own budget shows that they’re actually reducing supply. The budget shows that housing construction starts are projected to go down next year by almost 10%." ],

They’re collecting more, and not just a little bit: in the hundreds of millions of dollars more on the land transfer tax. They don’t want to address the housing crisis because they’re benefiting.

Earlier this month, the Toronto Real Estate Board released research that shows the number of buyers with a mailing address outside of Canada is well below 1%. It also shows that most of these buyers have a mailing address in the US. This is in direct conflict with what Chef Sousa said in the housing announcement, when he said that the number hovers around 8%. Clearly, evidence and facts are in contradiction to what this Liberal government is pushing out there.", "A day later, the chef told reporters that it was 5%.

It’s bad enough they’ve got the Green Energy Act that is sending billions in free electricity to our competitors in the US, now they’ve got cap-and-trade, which is going to be sending Ontarians’ hard-working funds. We have to buy green credits from California—$200 million by 2020; by 2030, $2.3 billion. We don’t need small towns in Ontario and their hard-working businesses subsidizing businesses in Beverly Hills, but they have signed Ontario into that scheme, and it’s going to hurt Ontario.

As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, this government has failed communities and families across the province. We put forward a budget request for a moratorium on school closures. When you hear the number of 600 schools and 300 more on the chopping block—and the government is clever with their lines. They said in the budget, “We’re going to open 94 new schools.” But then you read the fine print: They’ve got 300 on the chopping block, so nothing is happening to keep our schools open. I have to say, Madam Speaker, it is heartbreaking going to a community and hearing the community leaders say, “You take the school out of our town, you’re going to depopulate our town. You’re giving up on small-town Ontario.”", "When you hear what’s happening in small-town Ontario—and I can say it’s not just small-town Ontario. The government is ripping schools out of communities across the province. In my hometown of Barrie, they closed Barrie Central—in a city that has 6% population growth. So it’s not just small towns. They’re closing a school in Vaughan; they’re closing a school in Burlington. They are trying to pay for their scandals, their waste, their mismanagement by closing schools, and that’s not right.", "That’s why this is yet another budget request that this government has turned down: a very basic principle that said, “Put a moratorium on school closures.” I expected this from our Premier—I expected our Premier at least to have some sympathy for that request. After all, Premier Wynne got into politics, and she said that her purpose for getting into politics was to stop school closures.

And what I can’t believe is that at every single hospital I go to, the nurses talk about the nursing cuts, saying they never expected this. This was a government that promised they were going to invest in health care, and what we’ve seen is record numbers of nurses fired. This is their legacy. Because of their debt, their waste and mismanagement, they’ve had to make cuts in areas like education and health care. And now the only investments they’re making in health care are in the wrong areas—more bloated administration. They’re going to hire 84 new LHIN vice-presidents, more executive paper-pushers. When will they realize we need front-line care, not more administrators? They’ve got it all backwards.", "The last issue I wanted to get to before I wrap up is the issue of northern Ontario.

Northern Ontario has so much potential, and yet in this budget they cut the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines by $70 million—$70 million.

If they win the next election, this house of cards will fall apart because this is all a sales pitch. It is all misleading numbers. It is the government cooking the books.

I don’t blame them for it. Private corporations centre on making profits for their shareholders. That’s what they are there for. So private corporations tend not to focus on areas that don’t make money. Providing an essential service in rural Ontario is not going to be their profit centre and, as a result, they’re not going to focus on it. They shouldn’t, as a private corporation.

Toronto’s shelters are at 97% capacity, far above the 90% the city aims for. Peel region opened a youth shelter in Brampton, and it was filled to capacity on the very first day. The waiting list for affordable housing in Ontario is 171,000 families, 45,000 more than when this government was elected.", "Toronto Community Housing is closing an average of one unit a day because they can’t afford to maintain them to a livable standard. Vacancies in Toronto, Peterborough and Guelph are all around 1%, which is basically no vacancy at all.", "We’ve been hearing from people across the GTA, especially young people, that they are starting to believe they will never have the opportunity of owning a home.", "I want to recognize that the government has announced some proposals, but the reality is that nothing has changed. We’re still seeing lineups at the sales offices as people fight for the right to buy a new home or a condo. We’re still seeing bidding wars for houses and apartments.", "Last month, housing prices in Toronto increased another $44,495, to $943,947. The average detached home in Toronto last month was over $1.5 million. Last month, Peterborough, Cambridge, Pickering and other municipalities all saw prices continue to increase. Clearly, the problem has not been solved.", "We need to develop a real solution to stabilize the housing market. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said, “Toronto and Hamilton continue to face price acceleration, over-evaluation and overheating. Price growth has intensified and demand is outpacing supply in the rental, resale and new home markets.”", "But it isn’t just in the GTA. We’ve seen a rapid price increase in Peterborough, Guelph and Chatham-Kent. Young people are seeing the dream of home ownership slipping further and further away. We need to do more to address this housing crisis. We need to develop a plan in consultation with the experts to stabilize the real estate market. We need to address our shortage of supply.", "Solving the housing affordability problem is complex, and it will not happen with the solution created behind closed doors at Queen’s Park. This panel must include the people who plan houses, the people who build them and the people who live in them.", "We need the people who are on the front lines, who have experience planning communities, and the people who know how to build houses and where the roadblocks are.", "We need the people who are providing housing for our most vulnerable, and the people who are focused on smart growth to protect our environment; the people who finance homes, and the people who ensure that they are built properly.", "We need both the homeowner, who is worried about protecting equity for their retirement, and the young person who wants a home, to begin a new family.", "In early April, myself and our leader met with Juan Rojas, who had been trying to buy a new home for his growing family. He and his family have a three-year-old daughter and are expecting another child. At that point, they had put in offers on up to 10 homes, and every time they were outbid. They raised their offers to match the price that homes were selling for last week, but prices were increasing so fast that they couldn’t keep up. They were frustrated and discouraged.", "That day, the leader and I wrote a letter to Minister Sousa outlining five actions that we wanted to see the government take to address housing affordability. Establishing this panel was one of those points. We were hopeful that they would do so, but so far, they have only announced their intention to meet with the industry once a quarter. That’s just not enough. We need a panel with broad membership, clear goals and a tight timeline.", "Having these industry experts come together means that we will have real solutions that will work on the ground, and having a diverse group will avoid unintended consequences. Bringing the groups together is more effective than individual meetings because the groups share information and work together to find solutions that work for everyone. It’s easy for everyone to simply point to someone else as being the problem, but when they are part of the same working group there is an opportunity to examine the delays from both sides and look at what both sides can do to make the process work better.", "The panel will work together to come up with real solutions for red tape, increasing supply and stabilizing the real estate market. It will be delivering its report when the government is about ready to hold the second meeting from the group that they were going to meet with from their proposal.", "We have offered, over and over, to work with the government to address this issue. We have been raising alarm bells on housing affordability for years. In fact, over the last three years, I have raised affordable housing and housing affordability in this Legislature 140 times. But we need to ensure that the action we take is right and that it is not making the problem worse.", "Many experts have raised concerns in the last few weeks that the government’s recent announcement will result in vastly reduced supply and make the problem worse in the long run. The truth is that despite the announcement, not a single piece of red tape has been cut. There have been no changes that impact the process of buying a house, and there have been no changes to encourage supply. We need to ensure that we involve the experts who understand the complexities of the housing market and the unintended consequences that government policies can have.", "Just this week, a panel at the Land and Development Conference raised concerns that the government’s housing plan will not accomplish its goals. As Daniel Winberg of the Rockport Group said, “I’m hoping this plan will have some refinement and that the government will meet with industry leaders.”", "This morning, I was pleased to host a round table at Queen’s Park to start the discussion. I want to thank all the participants who made the time to come to the meeting: BILD, Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada, Association of Municipalities of Ontario, Federation of Rental-housing Providers of Ontario, Mortgage Professionals Canada, Ontario Home Builders’ Association, Toronto board of trade, Ontario Real Estate Association, Environmental Defence, and the Association of Ontario Land Economists. It was a great discussion, and it’s clear that there is value in bringing these groups together. When I asked people what the biggest challenge is for housing affordability, they all said “supply.” Several people mentioned that we need to work to ensure that there is also more choice and more diversity of homes. We also heard that there’s a lack of understanding of basic economics. When there is a shortage of supply, the price goes up. To stop the price from going up, we need to increase supply. They also talked about how complicated our planning and approvals process is and that other jurisdictions have more efficient systems.", "They began the discussion on how to increase supply with ideas on how to eliminate barriers to construction, innovative zoning, ways to get land serviced, and how the provincial government could lead by example. Everyone in that room agreed that there are ways we can make this system work better. There were already some disagreements—but this is the value of having everyone involved in the discussion: so they can work through the disagreements to come up with solutions that work for everyone to address the housing crisis.", "The constructive discussion this morning is evidence of the good work that this panel could accomplish. Already, we could see the value of having a discussion with all these groups in the same room.", "There has been wide support for developing a panel or task force to create a coordinated real plan, to deal with Ontario’s housing crisis.", "In a recent speech, Dave McKay, the CEO of Royal Bank of Canada, called for a multi-faceted solution which addresses supply constraints and speculative forces. He also said, “If it’s not done in a coordinated fashion, we could do real damage.”", "During our recent committee hearings, Joe Vaccaro from the Ontario Home Builders’ Association said, “That brings me to our last but perhaps most important recommendation for the standing committee to consider. In an environment of rapidly increasing housing prices, challenges in delivering housing supply, increasing development charges and other fees and the ever-changing planning approvals framework, I think it is time that the government take a complete view of the entire housing system and strike a panel to look carefully at the housing supply challenges and how they contribute to housing price—and I mean all contributing factors.”", "The Ontario Real Estate Association “recommends that the government of Ontario strike an affordable home ownership task force to study housing affordability and supply. The task force should work quickly to bring forward recommendations to the minister ... on how Ontario can increase housing supply.”", "Even the former Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing said recently in committee, “We did have long discussions about a housing panel and some of the people who may be on it. I’m a big supporter of that. I think it’s the way to go.” In fact, this morning I had a call from the Ontario Association of Architects, which has asked to be part of the panel if it is supported today and moved forward.", "One of the concerns that was raised at the round table this morning was that we still don’t have accurate data on the housing industry. At the announcement, the Minister of Finance said that foreign homebuyers are 8% of the market. The next day, he said that it was only 5%. Now the Toronto Real Estate Board says that it’s less than 1%.", "We believe that the only way for housing policies to be successful is to ensure that they are based on evidence and knowledge. Clearly, the government doesn’t have that knowledge, but the people on the panel do. They are offering their expertise to help solve this crisis. The government simply has to say yes.", "Most of us grew up with the dream of owning our own home. Our children and our grandchildren have that same dream, but for them, that may be all it is. Young people who are trying to save for a house are seeing prices increase faster than they can save. We have about 100,000 new people moving into the GTA every year, and we only build homes for a fraction of them. That means that unless we take real action to address supply, the housing shortage will get worse and worse.", "That’s why the leader and I included this housing affordability panel in our asks of the finance minister in early April. That’s why I’m asking all members to support this motion so that, by the end of the summer, we will have an expert report that gives us real, implementable solutions to stabilize the real estate market and once again make home ownership an achievable dream for all the people of Ontario." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s always an honour to stand here in Ontario’s provincial Parliament on behalf of the good people in Windsor–Tecumseh. Today, we are discussing the merits of a bill brought to us by my good friend from Oxford, Mr. Hardeman. He is a former mayor and a former warden, and he served a couple of times in a Conservative cabinet. In other words, this isn’t his first rodeo; he has been around the block a couple of times. Sometimes we’d do well to listen to his advice, and this is one of those times.", "What the member is proposing is one way of approaching the crisis we have in affordable housing in Ontario. We hope we can all agree that there is a lot to be done on the housing file. Like myself, Mr. Hardeman is a party critic for municipal affairs and housing. We agree—the two of us—that the government could be doing more to try to get a handle on this file.", "The Liberals, as you know, Speaker, have been in power the past 14 years. During that time, they’ve had 12 Ministers of Housing. Before that, the Conservatives were there for eight years, and they had six ministers—in total, 18 ministers in 22 years. The member from Oxford served as an associate minister in that portfolio with responsibility for rural affairs, so maybe that makes 19 ministers in 22 years.", "That, to me, says that housing has not been a priority for Ontario’s political leaders for a very long time. So now what can we do about that? Well, the member from Oxford has an idea. He suggests we appoint a housing affordability panel. He is calling for this panel to be made up of experts from across the housing sector. Their goal would be to develop real solutions to the housing affordability challenge. They’d look at ways of reducing red tape, of increasing the housing supply and of stabilizing the real estate market in both the short and long term, and they’d find ways to make it more affordable for first-time homebuyers to find a suitable place to live.", "Mr. Hardeman believes there will be a spot on that panel for planners and builders, as well as tenants and homeowners. There is quite a list of potential panel members, as we’ve heard. AMO would be there, of course, and the city of Toronto. There would be a spot for co-op housing people, and that’s a good thing, because Mr. Hardeman and myself are both co-chairs on a co-operative caucus here at Queen’s Park, along with Ms. Lalonde from Ottawa–Orléans. Planners, realtors, environmentalists, developers: It’s a lengthy list. And in case anybody has been forgotten, the bill says he’d accept any other experts that the ministry shall deem necessary.", "This wouldn’t be a job you’d take on if you didn’t want to work. The bill calls on the panel to be appointed within 30 days and to report back to the minister within three months. Then he would have 15 days to report his findings to this House. It’s a pretty ambitious agenda, but then again, it would have to be if we are to get serious about looking at options and alternatives in solving the crisis in affordable housing in this province.", "I’ve been told that the Liberal government held a series of consultations with housing stakeholders before introducing Bill 124 and before announcing they would be making other changes, such as imposing penalty taxes on those who live elsewhere but buy properties as portfolio investments in Ontario.", "I don’t believe there is one magic solution to the housing file. There are loopholes that can be plugged, regulations that can be updated and incentives that could be offered by governments at all levels. If ever there was a time for the stakeholders to come together, this is it. There can’t be winners and losers. We can’t scapegoat one partner. We must be fair to all.", "As we have seen so far while we listen to delegations at the Standing Committee on General Government over Bill 124, An Act to amend the Residential Tenancies Act, previous consultations didn’t work out so well. Many of the stakeholders have told us that they were expecting more or different solutions. Some of them have bluntly told us how disappointed they are with what was delivered as opposed to what they thought was promised. I wasn’t there for those consultations so I don’t know if anything was actually promised, but certainly we’ve been told the perception was left that their issues would be addressed in the bill, and they have not been. So there is work to be done.", "When I look at the list of associations that could be on this panel, I’d suggest we also invite a representative from Habitat for Humanity. That organization has been filling a need in many of our communities. I’d also suggest we have someone on there representing the many homeless shelters we have that operate around the province. Shelters provide a temporary fix as opposed to a more permanent solution, but they know the stories and they have the history of how easy it is to fall into homelessness. They must be part of this conversation as well. I’d also suggest we have a First Nations representative for discussions on how we can improve living conditions in their communities.", "We can’t limit our solutions to conditions in the big and mid-size cities. Small towns and rural communities must be represented.", "We should have academics on there as well, one or two of them who know the history of Ontario’s housing issues and know what has worked elsewhere and what may not have worked well in other places.", "This is a huge endeavour. It’s a major problem. It has been ignored for far too long. You can’t point fingers; we’re all part of the blame.", "CMHC should be there—they’re the housing experts—and maybe FCM.", "Ottawa has to step up to the plate. We need a national housing strategy.", "I commend the member from Oxford for bringing this home. We have to send a message, a strong one, that we aren’t content to sit back and allow the market to correct itself. It just isn’t going to happen. The issue needs study. It needs it now. Let’s do it. Let’s do it today. Thank you to the member from Oxford for bringing this forward." ],

It includes 16 points that, frankly, will make buying or renting a home more affordable, including the formation of a housing advisory group. The advisory group will provide ongoing advice to the government—and I emphasize “ongoing”—on the housing market. The group will be made up of a very diverse range of experts, including economists, academics, developers, community members and the real estate sector. We’re looking at a strong cross-section of all of those who are touched by housing.", "But our plan will go further and do more than what my critic has put on the table. I can give you the first example: Our government recognizes that maintaining a healthy supply is important to make buying or renting a house more affordable and fair. That’s why we’re creating a new housing supply team that will work with developers and municipalities to identify opportunities for bringing housing supply to market.", "I think we’ve referenced these before. The housing supply team is sort of our housing SWAT team that will be able to move in quickly, and have members who are senior enough in government that they can quickly deal with issues on the municipal side, the developer side or on the provincial side.", "So we really have two teams: a higher-level advisory team comprised of a wide range of experts in the market, and then our on-the-ground housing supply team that will be looking at real issues that developers and municipalities face as they try and get new projects to market.", "I can say that as I crossed Ontario talking to organizations and groups about housing in their communities, municipalities would sometimes express frustration with developers. Developers would sometimes express frustration with municipalities. Both would often express frustration about the province. This housing supply team is going to look at some of those and identify not only what we can do on an individual project, but identify some of the more systemic on-the-ground issues, the irritants that developers, municipalities and the province face on getting projects to market.", "We’re told in a study that there are about 70,000 shovel-ready approved housing units ready to go right now in the GTA, and about 118,000 more shovel-ready approved housing units ready to go in Toronto. The question is: Why aren’t they moving ahead? What’s holding that back?", "I believe the housing supply team and our advisory team will give us some insights into why that’s happening and what we can do to increase supply through making it easier for those units to be built and get to market.", "With all due respect, I think what the member opposite is introducing is something that’s a bit of an incomplete plan and just really doesn’t go far enough. If I wanted to be critical of my critic’s position, I would say that the first meeting of the PC’s proposed panel is not scheduled for over a year after our government began to address the issue.", "In the past year alone, and certainly since I became Minister of Housing, we’ve worked very hard alongside the government of British Columbia, as well as the cities of Toronto and Vancouver, in a federal working group on the housing market, trying to understand what the issues are at a national level, sharing data between Toronto, Vancouver, Canada and Ontario.", "We’ve met with people on every side of this issue, as I mentioned earlier: developers, planners, financial institutions, economists, federal and municipal partners, and realtors. Perhaps most importantly, though, we’ve listened to all of the people who are looking for a place to live or are struggling to pay for the place that they’re living in now. I can tell you, Speaker, that as I went across this country, there were heartbreaking stories of people who faced economic eviction, who faced eviction through the “own use” clause of the current legislation—things that we’re proposing to fix in our proposed legislation.", "Together with my friend Minister Mauro, the Minister of Municipal Affairs, we’ve put together a dedicated housing affordability team, made up of senior ministry staff. I can say that one of the disappointing things that I saw happen was last fall, when the Progressive Conservatives voted against doubling the land transfer tax rebate for first-time homebuyers. They voted against that relief for future homebuyers, and it is, shall I say, unfortunate. It’s money that anyone who is scrambling to buy a house, or to outfit the house, could certainly have used. I have heard from people who are very appreciative.", "The MPP for Oxford suggests that his suggested panel would take three months, and suggests legislation sometime in the future after those three months. Speaker, people need relief from increasing rent and housing prices now. They need it today. Three months is too long, and then we’d need to pass meaningful legislation after that. People need that relief now, not down the road.", "This panel, or the suggested panel—another reason I’m critical of it—although I will say I do get the spirit in which this is being put forward. I don’t think there is a member in here who isn’t somehow affected by the housing issues that we face, whether it be rapidly increasing housing prices or rental issues. Everyone is here because we really are concerned and we really do have the best interests of our constituents at heart.", "I will say that the suggested panel—a problem I have is that it would be a one-off. It won’t be revisiting the issue three months after its first report. It really doesn’t afford us the opportunity to assess how our legislation is working.", "That’s what we have in mind with our panel, Speaker. The academics, the businesspeople, the users, the renters, the homeowners: Those are the people we want to work with on an ongoing basis, to give us the feedback about how things are working in the field, so that we are better informed.", "I just want to take the few minutes I have left to talk about the bill that is now in committee, our fair housing bill.", "It goes without saying that housing is essential for families across Ontario, yet too many people are being affected by the growing pressures of trying to buy a home or afford their rent. I have said many times that when I’m walking down my street and going to pick my mail up from the local mailbox, not a day goes by where I don’t bump into a neighbour, and the talk, the discussion, always pivots to the price of real estate.", "First, everyone is amazed at how much their house is suddenly worth. But then we also recognize that this imparts a real hardship on younger people who are looking to get a good start in the housing market. Although we might be benefiting because we were fortunate enough to buy a house at a time when they were less expensive compared to the amount of money we were making, that’s not the same today. I hear that; I understand that. This government hears it, and it understands it.", "The flip side to that—and this is something that I learned as a municipal councillor in the greater Golden Horseshoe, in the GTA—is that the rising prices also really reflect the economic strength of our region, and they have benefited current homeowners.", "Speaker, we have over 100,000 people moving to this area of Canada each and every year. Within the GTHA, the greater Toronto and Hamilton area, we have to build a city the size of Kingston each and every year—all of the housing, all of the public facilities, the roads, the sewers, the water, the electricity. Each and every year, we have to build a city the size of Kingston somehow. We have to fit that number of people into the GTHA, and it is a challenge. But those people are coming here from across Canada, from around the world, because Ontario is a success.", "At the same time, though, we need to stabilize the housing market and make buying or renting a home fairer and more affordable.", "A number of things we have done have been introduced in the budget—for example, the non-resident speculator tax of 15% in the greater Golden Horseshoe. Ontario, as I said, remains a welcoming place, with many new immigrants choosing Ontario as a place to come and put down roots and be wonderfully productive members of this great province. Our tax targets only those looking for a quick profit or a safe place to park their money, not those looking for a new home in which to put down roots and raise their family.", "One of the key parts of the legislation we introduced is around expanding rent control to all private rental units, including those built after 1991, strengthening protections for tenants against sudden and dramatic rent increases. In my last few minutes, I’ll focus there.", "Travelling around Ontario, certainly travelling throughout the GTHA, we continually heard from tenants as they faced a really uncertain future about where they were going to be able to buy a house and how they were going to be able to afford their rental units. I can tell you that this is no way to build a strong and stable province, when there is that anxiety with people who don’t know if they’ll ever be able to own or rent." ],

Here once again, what appears to be happening is that consultations are merely window-dressing to ram through a politically expedient agenda. If there ever was an issue that required extensive debate, in-depth consideration and a consultation process inclusive of public and private sector representation, it’s the housing crisis facing Ontario today.", "This housing crisis in Toronto and the greater Toronto area is one of the most complex problems confronting government. It involves homeowners, renters, rental property owners, home and condo construction businesses, and multiple levels of government. An extensive consultation process is absolutely required in order to inform the development of measures to mitigate and address this housing crisis.", "What’s clear is that this motion introduced by the member from Oxford would result in the creation of a truly sector-representative panel tasked with the consideration of methods to increase housing supply, reduce red tape on housing, address affordability for first-time homebuyers, and stabilize the real estate market in both the short, mid- and longer term. It’s particularly crucial that housing supply and red-tape-reduction approaches are discussed by this proposed panel.", "The measures included in this Liberal government’s recent announcement, in my estimation, simply don’t go far enough to reduce the amount of red tape that prevents or delays the construction of new homes, condos and rental properties.", "The Fraser Institute, a well-regarded institute, as you know, measured the regulatory barriers that the housing construction industry faces, including how long it takes to obtain a building permit, how much it costs, and the opposition that home builders face, particularly from local councils and community groups. Particularly important is that their research found that long and uncertain approval processes can severely restrict the supply of new homes.", "In conjunction, the government’s measures to specifically address the supply of housing are insufficient. While the government has clearly acknowledged the importance of supply in the housing equation, if they are serious about housing affordability, their proposed plan should go much further.", "By addressing the fundamental imbalance between the demand and supply for housing, a long-term solution can be found that is to the benefit of homeowners, renters, landlords and home builders. That’s why the proposed panel in my colleague’s motion is so crucial, because the Liberal government’s plan does not include measures to affect some of the underpinning issues in the housing crisis. The proposed panel would include representatives from no less than 15 major stakeholder organizations and associations, and encompass groups that plan housing, build housing and live in housing.", "We know, and there are many members in this Legislature who have served with distinction on municipal councils—this is not anecdotal. The proposed panel reflects that. This panel would be focused on creating good policy, based on expert knowledge that will actually stabilize the real estate market; in contrast to the Liberal government’s plan, which was created behind closed doors, with very little empirical evidence and very little consultation with stakeholders.", "Effective consultation benefits decision-makers and providers too, as stakeholders become better informed and better motivated to get involved and support ideas if they have some influence over the agenda. Better-informed stakeholders are also likely to lead a drive for better quality engagement, which will in turn support efforts to improve policy directions.", "It’s much better to get people involved in difficult decisions, including the impact of changes to programs and services that they use. Focusing on a broad base of diverse stakeholders—private and public—ensures, I’m sure you would agree, greater public value in a time of constrained resources.", "Speaker, there is a substantial amount of evidence in support of public engagement on housing affordability and supply, as well as case studies showing that broad multi-sector engagement results in better outcomes, in particular, policy and program development. Over recent years, the public engagement model recommended by the member from Oxford has become well established as a best practice in supporting the development of public policies.", "I’m confident, Speaker, that the recommended approach from the member from Oxford will ensure that private and public sector representatives’ concerns and aspirations are directly reflected in the alternatives developed, and that feedback will be provided on how stakeholder input was factored in the decision-making, ultimately ensuring that their particular directions and longer-term directions are reflected in the ultimate program design." ],

The lack of supply, or the price, also affects health care costs, policing costs and corrections costs, because when people don’t have a safe home to live in, and they have mental health issues or they have other disabilities, they often find themselves camping out with the police or camping out in our correctional facilities, or being readmitted time and time again to our hospitals.", "The idea of a panel is good. The Liberals aren’t the only party that has good ideas.", "These problems have continued to grow for 14 years, under a Liberal government. Not one of these areas has actually gotten any better.", "I was the housing critic back in 2007, when I was elected. The Premier of today was the housing minister. In those days, I asked her to put a trial in place, a pilot, which would have seen three or four ministries that I have spoken about here today work together to see whether some of the money from those ministries could be funnelled elsewhere if people were housed properly and had the ability to get into safe housing.", "If the bill was passed—there’s quite a growing list there, and people have kind of added to that, but I think that we would need to add people like the Community Livings, our community legal clinics, and the landlord and tenant advisory people. Those are all people who deal with the most vulnerable in our communities, who have lots of insight into the problem side of those constituents that they represent for us. Every day, they’re dealing with those people.", "I’m going to be introducing a bill that hopefully will augment some of the work that the member from Oxford is trying to achieve here, that would actually put regulation and licensing around supportive-living secondary lodges, because today they are unregulated, and many of those places need to have some regulation.", "The non-profit ones generally are operating well, and people are being looked after in a very respectful way. But for many of the for-profits, there are huge problems that, certainly, I’ve been dealing with in the Niagara region. I know there have been problems up in St. Thomas and in London. I’m sure that every member in this House has a for-profit lodging that could be problematic for their constituents.", "The Liberal housing minister said that they have the best interests of the residents at heart.

I think that the suggestion of Habitat for Humanity and our Community Living organizations makes a lot of sense.", "On the flip side, I was as concerned and disappointed that the minister played this game of, “My panel is better than your panel.” To suggest that three months is a long time in the life of a government and in the life of housing unaffordability in Ontario is ridiculous. We have had house unaffordability and housing shortages in Ontario for many, many years—I would suggest, oh, maybe since 2003, since the Liberals came into power. The question becomes, if this was such a critically important issue, and three months is far too long, in the words of the Minister of Housing, what have you been doing?", "Half of my riding of Dufferin–Caledon is in the GTA and half of it is outside the GTA. I can tell you that Dufferin–Caledon has a housing problem. We do not have the amount of housing stock and supply that people are looking for. I’ll quote from my colleague from Oxford: “Home ownership is a dream that is getting further and further out of reach for many young people. This panel will put forward real solutions to address that affordability.”", "I had the pleasure of listening in on the panel that the member from Oxford participated in, hosted, organized this morning. It was an hour and a half. It had many of the representations listed in his resolution. At the end of an hour-and-a-half discussion around the table—which was excellent, by the way—they said that these kinds of inclusive, participatory panels bring us closer together, not further apart. We’re not playing this game where one industry or one organization or aspect of the housing supply and affordability issue is given more credibility and more weight than others. By putting everyone in the room together, by having discussions about where the barriers are, where the challenges are, we can move forward together. We can have industry and we can have social agencies and municipalities and lending organizations all coming together and offering suggestions that will actually see an improvement.", "It’s very quick, the turnaround that is being suggested. The panel must be appointed within 30 days. The report must happen within three months. After that, within 15 days it has to come back to the chamber. So to suggest that this is a delaying tactic, to suggest that this is kicking the can down the road, is, frankly, laughable. We are offering a suggestion. The member for Oxford, if he is known for anything, is known for his pragmatic view of how to solve issues. This is not a partisan resolution. This is a resolution that is trying to proactively, frankly, offer the government a gift, and I would suggest to you that you look across the floor and say, “Thank you for the gift. We would welcome to receive it.” It speaks to how he can bring people together and how, in bringing people together, solutions are found.", "Is there an opportunity for expanding who participates? Absolutely; no question. If there are organizations and individuals out there who have things to share, I think it is incumbent on us and the minister to hear those views. Some of them may be opposing views, but isn’t that ultimately what we are supposed to be about?", "We want to bring forward some suggestions that will actually make your life easier and ensure that the young people who are looking at the news articles, reading the stories and saying, “There is never going to be a time in my life in Ontario where I can afford a home”—sadly, that is the kind of thing I’m hearing now, and it must end." ],

This panel is totally opposite. This panel is being set up to quickly get it all together.", "He also spoke of two years of consultation that developed a 16-point plan. I want to tell you, the people we talked to this morning, all the professionals in the industry, said your plan isn’t going to work. So I’m just suggesting that this panel would look at what needs to be done across the housing sector, and they will deliver that to the minister. The minister can see what he wants to implement from that. Then he can use all his panels that he has put in place—which has the advisory people from his ministry who already exist there. I thought they were advising him all this time; that’s what they were getting paid for. But if that’s what he wants to do, then, fine; he can keep them in place. This has nothing to do with going forward; this is to provide some advice to the minister so that we can solve some of these problems, because it isn’t getting any better. Fourteen years, and look at the mess we’re in.", "Unless we change the direction and start doing things differently, we’re not going to be able to solve this problem.

You can’t tell me that in those 50 amendments that we, shall we say, slaved over for a few days—they didn’t give us much time—that there wasn’t one that merited supporting because they came from the wrong side.

Lawren Harris was a founding member of the Group of Seven, who are known for their scenic depictions of Canada’s landscapes. The seven consisted of Franklin Carmichael, A.Y. Jackson, Franz Johnston, Arthur Lismer, F.H. Varley, J.E.H. MacDonald and Lawren Harris.", "Harris was regarded as the driving force behind the group’s movement, encouraging discussion and lending his artistic vision to fellow colleagues. His works have sold for millions at auctions in recent years and can be found on display in major Canadian art galleries such as the Art Gallery of Ontario, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection and the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa. In honour of his contributions to Canadian culture, Bill 82 is an act to proclaim October 23 Lawren Harris Day.", "Lawren Harris was born on October 23, 1885, in Brantford, Ontario. His father was Thomas Morgan Harris, the secretary of Massey-Harris Co. Ltd., a major manufacturer of agricultural equipment. During his comfortable upbringing, Harris had plenty of opportunity to explore his creative side and occupy himself with drawings and paintings, creating Christmas cards for family and friends.", "After attending St. Andrew’s College and Central Technical School in Toronto, Harris studied for a brief period at the University of Toronto. His mathematics professor caught sight of Harris’s sketchbook and suggested to his mother that he go away and study in Europe. Before long, he went to Berlin to pursue his passion.", "He spent three years travelling around Europe, from 1904 to 1907, studying European art and immersing himself in modern artistic movements, including symbolism, expressionism and Fauvism. He was deeply moved when he stumbled upon a religious philosophy called theosophy, which encouraged one to reflect on the mysteries of life and nature and its underlying principles. This newfound spirituality would inform many of his later works.", "Upon returning to Canada, Harris painted rural landscapes and urban scenes, often venturing into the Ward, an impoverished neighbourhood for immigrants in Toronto, to capture a day in the life. These paintings capture important scenes in Toronto’s history.", "In the 1910s, that particular period of time, he used to hang out at the Arts and Letters Club in St. George’s Hall. There he met fellow artist J.E.H. MacDonald. He introduced Harris to the other soon-to-be members of the Group of Seven, alongside Tom Thomson and Emily Carr.", "In the years before the war, they met regularly to share their opinions on modern art and the direction in which they wanted to take it. In 1913, Harris financed a studio, for himself and his colleagues, called the Studio Building for Canadian Art, located in the Rosedale ravine. Tom Thomson opted to work and live in a small construction shack out back.", "The avid outdoorsman Tom Thomson led Harris and company on excursions that took them well north of Toronto, into Algonquin and Algoma, where some of the most renowned paintings would be envisioned. Lawren Harris would spend much time on the banks of Lake Superior. Arthur Lismer and Tom Thomson would spend time adventuring in Algonquin Park. Franz Johnston went into the Canadian Shield to capture the northern lights.", "After World War I ended, the artists could reconvene in relative peace, and the Group of Seven was officially founded in 1920. Distinguished artists in their own right, the seven further developed their ideas through discussion and broke away from the European traditions that pervaded early Canadian art.", "Tom Thomson certainly would have been an eighth member, except he mysteriously drowned in 1917 in Canoe Lake in Algonquin Park. Some believe he was caught in a bad storm. Others believe he committed suicide. Some think Thomson was murdered. To this day, it is a tale told around campfires that frightens children as well as grown adults.", "Although not a member of the Group of Seven, Emily Carr, another exceptional Canadian artist, was closely associated with them. Harris’s work greatly inspired her and encouraged her to pursue art when she had stopped painting in the late 1920s. Fortunately, she continued, for it was in the following decade that she produced many of her finest works.", "As with all great artists, Harris’s style changed dramatically over the course of his career. His artwork progressed from capturing a nationalistic view of a Canada still rooted in its colonial heritage, to capturing a more profound, universal aspect of nature that manages to combine its awe and its mysticism. While many of the other members of the Group of Seven were fascinated with varying seasons and lighting, Harris focused on exposing nature in its truest essence. The others soon incorporated his techniques and vision into their own work.", "The effect of his European training is evident in his early works: detailed urban scenes, with loose strokes of rich, earthy tones, reminiscent of post-Impressionist art. But over time, he developed his own unique style. His brush strokes became smoother, his colour palette more refined, and he started reducing the environment into geometrical shapes, culminating in classic works such as Mount Lefroy, Afternoon Sun, Lake Superior and North Shore, Lake Superior.", "In the mid-1930s until his death on January 29, 1970, Harris spent his days in Santa Fe and Vancouver with his second wife, Bess Housser, creating increasingly abstract works.", "Harris had three children with his first wife, Beatrice Phillips.", "From the shores of Lake Superior to the Rocky Mountains and up into the Arctic fringes, Lawren Harris managed to record the ultimate Canadian experience with his simplistic, abstract interpretation of Canadian landscapes. Nowadays, his paintings are in high demand. In 2015, Mountain and Glacier sold for $4.6 million, followed by Mountain Forms, which sold for $11.2 million in 2016, setting a record for the most expensive Canadian painting ever sold at auction.", "As you may know, Madam Speaker, last year Harris’s work was on display at an exhibition held at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The exhibition was co-curated by the comedian Steve Martin. If you can get Steve Martin to promote your work, you’re probably doing all right. Martin stumbled upon Harris at a private auction and initially thought he had discovered a hidden gem, until Harris’s painting sold for over $2 million. The Harris exhibitions were a huge success, drawing tens of thousands of placid visitors to see his work.", "His work crops up all over the place. In 1972, his painting Mount Thule, Bylot Island was featured on a stamp, and school art classes across Canada regularly study and recreate his artwork—talk about the importance of teaching students about iconic Canadians.", "Lawren Harris’s contributions to art and artists alike have had a lasting impact and helped to forge a unique artistic identity for Canada—talk about the importance of our geography. The formation of the Group of Seven resulted in the creation of numerous art collectives, such as the Canadian Group of Painters and the Eastern Group of Painters, which have helped Canadian artists to connect, share ideas and innovate.", "Harris’s openness and adventurous spirit also serve as a prime example for many aspiring artists. On one hand he was solitary and independent, while on the other he appreciated the value of collaboration and advocated for greater interconnectivity within the arts community.", "To this day, Madam Speaker, his newfound global acclaim is helping to put Canadian art on the map and introducing the world to Canada’s vastitude.", "I’m pleased to have the privilege, on behalf of Speaker David Levac, MPP for Brantford, to present this particular bill to the Legislature. Initially, when it was presented before, by Han Dong, a Toronto member, it was co-sponsored by Bill Walker—I’m using the names; I’m not supposed to right now—the member for Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, who was kind enough at that time to co-sponsor the bill and who I see across the floor is prepared to offer his comments on it.", "We’re all proud of the Group of Seven. We’re proud of our artists. It is something that we as Canadians, being part of a country that’s rather younger—though it’s 150 years this year. We have taken some time to perhaps recognize those who have made a contribution over the years.", "It’s appropriate that this assembly deals with this particular bill today. It was initiated—I give full credit to Speaker David Levac and not to myself. I thought, as a gesture of kindness, I suppose, to our Speaker, who announced that he will not be seeking re-election to the Legislative Assembly—we thank him for his fine service to the people of Brant and the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. This gesture on my part is something I can say is the least I can do.", "I should also say that David Levac, before he became Speaker, was kind enough to come down to St. Catharines on many occasions for special occasions, which he’s precluded from doing now that he is the Speaker of the assembly.", "With that, I’ll sit down.

Over almost a century, he produced an incredible lifetime of work. From his time as a member of the Group of Seven until his death in 1970, he created some of the images that we consider most iconically Canadian, whether they be the forests of Algonquin Park, the majestic Rocky Mountains or the sublime and mysterious northern vistas.", "Harris was also a huge supporter and advocate for other artists and for their continued recognition. Whether it was supporting emerging artists in studio classes or being one of the prime drivers for the creation of the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound, in the great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, in honour of maverick artist Tom Thomson, Harris’s influence and legacy continues to inspire and affect Canadian culture in profound ways. In this way, having a day established to honour one of Canada’s most important artists is a wonderful way to celebrate.", "Of course, I’d be remiss if I didn’t talk about why we can take pride in the Group of Seven—it’s that we live in a country and province that is truly the world’s prettiest playground. It is our vast, wild and rugged landscapes that gave Lawren Harris and the Group of Seven a medium to call their own. They knew how to enjoy the beauty of our massive, untamed outdoors, and then to embed it in their art, which is what made them world famous.", "This is why I have always been the strongest supporter of the efforts of our outdoor education program, a kind of made-in-Ontario education medium which brings learning to life and connects students to the built and natural world around them. I’m proud to say, Madam Speaker, that I served at our outdoor education centre. It truly does connect our youth with the outdoors. It gives many children, not only in our own backyard, who live in rural Ontario, but many who come from the city what might be their first, hopefully, of a lifetime of love of our outdoors, the environment, nature and all that we have to offer. It even serves as a training ground for a new generation of Canadian naturalists and painters.", "Robert Bateman is one such example. Bateman, as the members will know, is another renowned artist and naturalist, and a staunch supporter of Ontario’s outdoor education program. He sees how the outdoor program is helping build a new generation of naturalists and even artists.", "Of course, I would be remiss if I didn’t talk about Mr. Bateman’s deep disappointment over the ongoing loss of the outdoor education centres, which is the result of mass school closures across Ontario. One of the 300 they’re shuttering, sadly, is Robert Bateman High School, which includes the closure of the outdoor ed program and the beloved art room. I wonder if members gave much thought to this: that their government is actually shuttering Robert Bateman High School in Burlington. How ironic it is that we stand here lauding the greatest painters of our wild outdoors, while this government allows their very training grounds and a school named after our own Robert Bateman to be wiped out.", "Mr. Bateman said in response to that school closure, “When you cut down a tree, it’s very hard to get it to grow again.” He also said, ominously, “It’s the end of a very beautiful era.” It is my hope that someone can still go to the education minister and talk to her and the Premier and remind them that the era does not have to end like this.", "We can go on celebrating Lawren Harris and the Group of Seven, and other great outdoor painters like Tom Thomson, who is renowned and revered, certainly in my backyard. But from across the world, people come to the gallery in Owen Sound to admire him—I mean, very much a mystique. He died in Algonquin Park on a canoeing trip, so that mystique draws. His art, if you’ve ever had the opportunity—I don’t know where the member Laura Albanese is from; I can’t remember her riding. Maybe you could help me, Madam Speaker?" ],

Some fairly large donors are willing to come on board and help to do that, so that they can actually put more artwork out. Much of it, sadly, is in storage as opposed to being on the walls for people to admire. That just allows other paintings, like Lawren Harris’s, and donations to be received so that art is always on display. There’s nothing sadder, in my mind, when I go there and there’s actually more in the back rooms. It still has to be contained there. They have to have all of the environmental aspects, to keep it heated and cooled properly. So you’re spending all of that money, and it’s a shame that it’s in a back room and not on a wall for all of the public to be able to admire. So it’s my hope that we can do that.", "I’d like to commend—I’m going to get all the right names of this one—the member from St. Catharines, the government whip and, I would suggest, the dean of our Legislature, Mr. Bradley, for acknowledging and doing what he’s doing. I did have the pleasure of originally co-signing this with Han Dong. And I certainly congratulate Dave Levac, the member from Brantford, who wrote this bill, but in his role as Speaker could not actually present it.", "We could go on, but what I really want to say is that we can ensure our vast rural and northern landscapes stay alive by keeping our schools and educational opportunities there open, and truly, always, be proponents of the art, the culture, and all that that adds to our great province.", "We’re very fortunate in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound to have artisans of all walks who actually bring beauty to life. We all have different tastes, different palettes, but at the end of the day, they are huge economic contributors. But mostly, it’s our cultural vibrancy and that mosaic that makes us truly Canadian.", "I’m pleased to support this, and I thank the members for all that they’ve done to bring it to the House." ],

I, like many of us, knew of Lawren Harris, of course, but until I started reading more of his background in preparation for today’s debate, I never really knew just what a fascinating person he was. As we’ve heard, he was born and spent his early years in Brantford, where they are looking forward to this bill passing into law. I’ll get back to that at the end of my discussion.", "I will borrow extensively from previously published articles about Harris. I begin with excerpts from a Jason McBride story in Toronto Life last June: “Lawren Harris, the Group of Seven’s flamboyant front man ... could have been a Photoplay cover boy—squint and you might see Charlie Chaplin, squint tighter and maybe Clark Gable. His buddies were bank presidents, doctors and industrialists, and he built elegant, expensive houses for his family. Still, he always felt more at home in the deep bush.”", "Lawren is not a common name. You see, his mother wanted to call him Lawrence, his father thought Lorne was a good name, and they settled on Lawren.", "His father was rich from a farm machinery business he merged with his competitors, the Masseys, and they grew the Massey-Harris Co. into the largest agricultural firm in the British Empire.", "The Harris family was very religious. Morning and evening prayer was mandatory, as was going to church three times every Sunday. Young Lawren had a rebellious streak, though. When he was seven, he donned one of his father’s suits, dressed his younger brother in his mother’s dress and fur stole, and then they showed up at the church parading down the aisle.", "He was given his first watercolour set as a toddler, and he promptly ate the coloured cubes as if they were candy.", "One of his childhood buddies was Vincent Massey, who would later become our first native-born Governor General.", "He was not a healthy child, so when he was home ill, he sketched, he coloured, he painted, and his appreciation for the arts flourished.", "Speaker, in the old days, there was a neighbourhood called the Ward, and we’re practically in it right here. It was bordered by College, Queen, Yonge and University. The Ward was home to waves of newcomers: Jewish, Italian, Irish and Chinese. They crowded into rundown rooming houses and sweatshops. Obviously, that industrial, rundown area of Toronto is no more. As he grew older, Lawren Harris found poetry in the Ward’s poverty. He not only sketched and painted there, but he wrote his one book of free verse about the Ward as well.", "Here’s a small taste of those gloomy images from A Note of Colour: “In a part of the city that is ever shrouded in sooty smoke ... hides a gloomy house of / broken grey rough-cast, like a sickly sin in a callow soul.” Wow.", "Let me borrow now from an article written last July for the Toronto Star by Murray Whyte. It was written to promote the Lawrence Harris exhibit that comedian Steve Martin put together at the Art Gallery of Ontario. This Murray Whyte article is poetry in itself. Listen to this: “It starts with Harris’s earliest pictures of Toronto, a teeming brew of industry and people that coalesce in its gritty, hardscrabble streets. The Eaton’s manufacturing plant looms above the Ward, a tight warren of immigrant worker’s cottages where Nathan Phillips Square now sits, cloaked in a smoky shroud. A gas plant belches steam over the dun-grey snow of the city’s filthy core. A weathered two-storey shack perches on a desolate street, its plaster hide crumbling into the muck below, the sky the colour of ash.”", "Wow. Speaker, how can anyone not visualize that scene from Murray Whyte? He just painted for us in describing the Lawren Harris exhibit of his early works at the AGO.", "He calls him a “hearty nationalistic flag-waver,” saying he “falls away, replaced with a sensitive soul likely more true to his actual character. Partly out of social conscience, and likely partly out of guilt—the scion of a wealthy industrialist family, he was the beneficiary of the city’s rough transition into polluted, sometimes violent squalor—Harris painted the city, and the Ward specifically, with a devoted pathos.”", "Murray Whyte takes us into the next room at the AGO, a world away, to his idolized mountains and shorelines. He writes:", "“Out of the darkness of a roiling city lurching into the modern age, we arrive in the jarringly cleansing light. And suddenly, the paintings look nothing like the idealized patriotic chestnuts of a true north strong and free we’ve been so heavily conditioned to see.", "“Harris’s works here—unpeopled, imagined, spiritualized landscapes he’d rarely seen—slip the yoke of nationalist iconography. Instead, they become the isolating escapism of a sensitive soul bent on crafting his own world once the tumult of the real one became too much to bear.", "“This is no excuse, and there can be none, for the artist’s own erasures here—notably, of the First Nations peoples he encountered on his northern sojourns—but there is, at last, some clarifying explanation. Harris abandoned the complexity he could no longer bear for a purity of his own creation.”", "Speaker, the Group of Seven is considered Canada’s greatest art collective. With Lawren Harris in the lead, they changed the art world forever for Canada. My legislative assistant, Angie Dawson, discovered an article written by Heather Bot. She’s a staff writer with Algoma Country. She writes, “This group rode the rails into the deep recesses of the Algoma wilderness to escape not just the hustle and bustle of Toronto, but to immerse themselves into our landscapes that brought them peace and a sense of tranquility. With the death of their friend Tom Thomson and the horrors of World War I, our healing landscapes brought them here again and again.”", "Speaker, Ms. Bot also gives us 10 interesting facts about the members of the Group of Seven that might surprise you:", "“(1) The first trips to Algoma were in May and September of 1918, when members of the group painted along the rail line.", "“(2) Members of the group used handcarts to travel up and down the rail line to access painting sites.", "“(3) A.Y. Jackson returned to Michipicoten Bay and area often between 1955 and 1961, where he shared ownership of a cottage. The cottage still stands today in Wawa, although located on private property.", "“(4) A.Y. Jackson painted a headstone in the Garden River Cemetery and no one knows why. It’s a mystery!", "“(5) Not all members of the group painted in Algoma; Frederick Varley never painted here, but his grandson travels here every summer to hike in Lake Superior Provincial Park!", "“(6) Lawren Harris wrote poetry during the years he was in Algoma.", "“(7) Dr. Frederick Banting, who discovered insulin, was a member of Toronto’s Arts and Letters Club, where he befriended ... A.Y. Jackson and Lawren Harris.", "“(8) There are over 400 discovered sites painted by the Group of Seven in Algoma....", "“(9) In 1995, Canada Post issued 10 stamps, each based on a painting by each member of the group; three of those stamps were paintings from Algoma,” including Lawren Harris’s North of Lake Superior.", "“(10) In 2009, an oil sketch by Harris titled The Old Stump, Lake Superior sold for $3.5 million, the second highest price ever paid for a painting in Canada at the time.”", "Of course, Speaker, as we know, last year Harris’s Mountain Forms painting sold at auction for $9.5 million, the most expensive artwork ever sold at a Canadian auction, and when you factor in the 18% buyer’s premium, which comes out of winning bidder’s pocket and goes to the auction house, the total price was $11.21 million. Winter Landscape sold at auction for $3,658,000, and his Mountain and Glacier also sold in 2015. It sold for $4,602,000.", "There’s a wonderful documentary called Where The Universe Sings: The Spiritual Journey of Lawren Harris. The great Canadian actor Colm Feore stars in that movie. Just so you know, Speaker, his mother, Sally Feore, worked for 24 years as an administrator with the Windsor Symphony Orchestra. There’s always a Windsor connection.", "It’s a wonderful bill, and we should all be proud to help proclaim Lawren Harris Day in Ontario. He was one of our best landscape artists, imbuing his paintings with a spiritual dimension. In 1926, he wrote: “We are on the fringe of the great north and its living whiteness, its loneliness and replenishment, its resignations and release, its call and answer, its cleansing rhythms. It seems that the top of the continent is a source of spiritual flow that will ever shed clarity into the growing race of America.”", "His most famous works were done in Toronto, then in Algoma region, the North Shore of Lake Superior, and the Rocky Mountains. He settled down in Vancouver, where he died.", "Brantford hasn’t forgotten Lawren Harris. The good people there in Speaker Dave Levac’s riding are looking favourably on the outcome of this bill. They want to turn this into a launching pad for a walk of fame. They want to turn Lawren Harris Day into the spark that ignites a fall festival of the arts.", "Just so you know, Speaker, Speaker Levac is also a bit of an artist himself. He was accepted in the Ontario College of Art at the same time he got into teachers’ college. He chose education over art at that time, but now that he’s retiring, he’s got a hobby already built into his plans. Let’s help him with that. Let’s pass this bill. Let’s give Brantford a reason to celebrate. Let’s honour one of the greatest Canadian painters of all time. Let’s declare October 23 Lawren Harris Day in Ontario.", "I thank you for your time this afternoon." ],

When my father visited Canada for the first time, almost two decades ago, one of the places on his to-see list was Brantford, Ontario. He was an engineer with a real passion for engineering, and he absolutely wanted to visit the city where the telephone was invented. So I have this wonderful memory of going to Brantford to see the homestead of Alexander Graham Bell.", "What neither my father—who can be excused, because he was a tourist—nor me as a Canadian were aware of was the fact that Brantford was also home to one of Canada’s most famous artists, part of the G7, Lawren Harris. A story like mine underscores why it is so important to set aside a day to celebrate this great man.", "I’m going to quote from the same article in Toronto Life that the member from Windsor–Tecumseh did, when I say that here is one depiction of Lawren Harris: “Lawren Harris, the Group of Seven’s flamboyant frontman, was dashing, oracular, ambitious and enigmatic.”", "One of the interesting things about Lawren Harris is that we often think of artists as starving artists, but Lawren actually came from a very wealthy family, one of the wealthiest families in Canada at the time, and used that wealth to promote not only his art but Canadian art. I think that is what we’re celebrating as well today, the idea: What is Canada?", "One of the things that I am struck by often in this Legislature is that when members from the north, in particular, talk about northern Ontario, there’s a particular sense of pride, that, “We are just a little bit special because we are from the true north.” I think that sense of Canada being the north is such an essential part of Canadian identity. I see that pride even here in our Legislature. Certainly Lawren Harris was among those trying to get a handle on a still-young country, still a colonial country, as Canada tried to carve out its own niche, its own identity, its own sense of self. The Far North was a big part of that imagination.", "I’m going to quote from Lawren Harris’s own words, to try and capture what he was trying to capture of Canada through his paintings: “Dr. MacCallum and I took a train to the Soo and, the next morning, went up the Algoma Central Railroad and discovered a paradise for Canadian painters—wild, rugged, tumultuous country.... After that, each October for four years, in a railroad boxcar, with a handcar and a canoe, MacDonald, Jackson, Lismer and I explored and painted Algoma.”", "He goes on to say, “Our aim is to paint the Canadian scene in its own terms. This land is different in its air, moods and spirit from Europe and the old country. It invokes a response which throws aside all preconceived ideas and rule-of-thumb reactions.”", "He goes on further, to say at one point, “It has to be seen, lived with and painted with complete devotion to its own life and spirit before it yields its secrets,” when he spoke of the north.", "What’s really interesting, as we celebrate Lawren Harris here today, is that for a while, because of his personal life, he actually had to go into exile. He left Ontario, left Canada and went to the United States. When he did come back, he lived in Vancouver, and his visits to Toronto were very brief. But I think some of us might be interested to know that for a while, he lived in a huge mansion at 63 Queen’s Park Crescent, not very far from where we are. That house is no longer in existence. It has been torn down, and it’s part of the University of Toronto buildings. But somewhere here, very close to the Legislature, I know that Lawren Harris spent some time painting.", "To me, it’s such a great pleasure and an honour, particularly as we’ve spoken about our Speaker and his particular interest in getting this bill enacted, so I certainly hope I see the support in this Legislature. We know that the Speaker has announced formally that he is not going to be running again. I can’t think of a better tribute and a better gift, if I may use the word, to our Speaker than to ensure that this legislation is supported by all of us and that, indeed, we do get October 23 as Lawren Harris Day, to celebrate what it means to be somebody who tried so hard and is such an integral part of defining what Canada is." ],

Yet Lawren went on to not only transcend his own hometown, but benefited the appreciation of art, the growth and understanding of Canadian natural beauty, the importance of recognizing the true gift that Ontario is to Canada when it comes to natural beauty, but, really, the gift that Canada is, as a whole, to the world.", "I believe the member beside me, the member for Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, spoke about how northern Ontario is the playground of Canada. I would argue that perhaps we could extend that and say that Canada is God’s playground, because we have an absolutely incredible profusion of colours and diversities within our natural landscape, that Lawren Harris and the Group of Seven recognized, that they helped to encapsulate, and that they went on not only to pictograph but to inspire future generations to come up with a greater appreciation for: Canadian landscape and Canadian art as well.", "As a young person, I think it’s especially pertinent that I speak to this, because unfortunately, although I think there is an appreciation of art, there’s also a lessening understanding of finite art. What I mean by that—perhaps it’s a strange term to use—is that we live in an age where you can flip on your phone and access high-quality photos of art from across the world. You can access images of art from many different cultures, from many different places across our country, across our continent and across the world. Sometimes we can lose appreciation of that very rich beauty that an original piece of artwork contains.", "Lawren Harris once said, though, “The power of beauty at work in man, as the artist has always known, is severe and exacting, and once invoked, will never leave him alone, until he brings his work and life into some semblance of harmony with its spirit.” I think we can all agree that when one sees an original piece of art done by the Group of Seven or by Lawren Harris, there’s a sharp, emotive quality to that art that is uniquely powerful when it’s seen first-hand.", "I do want to take the opportunity to say on the record that I think we do need to be encouraging more young people to get involved in the arts. We need to be making sure that they get involved in the very real, very tangible original artwork that Lawren Harris helped create.", "Really, Lawren was one who loved art for art’s sake. He didn’t love art for the sake of wealth. He didn’t love art for the sake of any sense of greatness in himself. In fact, he often didn’t date his art, and he often didn’t even sign his art, because he wanted that art to be appreciated for its innate value, not because of who had created it or when it was made, but really to be appreciated as that pictograph of the reality that he saw.", "Harris had an enormous amount of impact on the Group of Seven, as the only independently wealthy member of the Group of Seven, in fact. The rest, including Franklin Carmichael, A.Y. Jackson, Franz Johnston, Arthur Lismer, J.E.H. MacDonald and F.H. Varley, made their living as commercial artists, and at one time several of them even worked together in the same shop. But Harris financed those famous boxcar trips for the artists to attend to the Algoma region, and he really made the work of the Group of Seven possible in many ways. He helped inspire them as they contemplated their interpretations of the Canadian landscape in such a way.", "They believed very distinctly in a Canadian perspective to art. They had the belief that Canada itself must inspire distinctly Canadian art. I think that when we look at the work of the Group of Seven, but especially the work of Lawren Harris, who is arguably the greatest painter who Canada has ever produced, we do see that unique beauty that is specific to Canada. I think we should embrace that as an assembly and as a province, and I’m excited to support this motion that the honourable member for Brantford has brought forward. I look forward to hearing the rest of the remarks this afternoon." ],

The use of colour, the large pieces to express shade and this expression of the size, the massiveness of our Canadian landscape are truly amazing.", "Lawren Harris was a Canadian painter, as mentioned by many members in this House this afternoon, born in Brantford. I also want to remind the members that Brantford is home to some of Canada’s greatest talents, including Alexander Graham Bell, Dr. James Hillier and, of course, the Great One, Wayne Gretzky.", "It can be argued that Lawren Harris started the Group of Seven. In fact, he was credited with being the driving force behind their formation. Whether he was with the group or on his own, he definitely pioneered a distinctly Canadian painting style that now is envied and studied around the world. His work is an integral part of Canadian art and its history and is recognized throughout the world. He painted many Ontario landscapes during his professional career.", "Back in November 2005, in Toronto, a Lawren Harris painting, once locked away in the dark of a hospital broom closet, came back into the light of public admiration, selling at a packed downtown auction house for $1.38 million. Decades earlier, before it was sold, that very painting was donated to Toronto Western Hospital in my riding. It was donated by Toronto financier Edward Rogers Wood and his wife, Agnes. The painting was called Algoma Hill. It is a landscape from the area north of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.", "For some years, the painting had hung on the hospital wall but at some point it was put into storage for safekeeping and then, I’m sure, people might have forgotten about it. The place was described as a broom closet. Then they found it and it was later auctioned.", "The painting sold in 2005 for $1.38 million, but that wasn’t the most expensive auctioned painting by Lawren Harris. Recently—I think it was last year—his work named Mountain Forms was auctioned off for $11.2 million in Toronto, and that was a record for the most expensive work done by a Canadian artist auctioned around the world. So there’s no question that Lawren Harris’s work has a large following, a big fan base, and it’s iconic to our Canadian history.", "We have so many tourists coming to Toronto, coming to Ontario, coming to Canada every year, and the AGO is a place they visit. They get a chance to learn about Canadian art. I think the contribution by Lawren Harris is massive, not just in the art world but in the history of our great country and its diversity.", "I urge all members to support this bill and proclaim October 23 as Lawren Harris Day." ],

The OPPI is composed of nearly 4,500 skilled professionals who work in government, private practice, universities and not-for-profit agencies, in the fields of urban and rural development, urban design, environmental planning, transportation, health, social services, housing, and economic development.", "If passed, this act will safeguard the public interest by further strengthening the profession’s strict practice requirements and further improving accountability of the institute and its members.", "The bill proposes to add additional definitions and title protection for professional planners. It creates prohibitions and offences respecting the use of specified designations and initials by unauthorized individuals. Further, it provides a framework for membership and sets out procedures for dealing with matters such as: complaints against current and former registered professional planners, procedures for determining whether a member of the institute is incapacitated, and powers to appoint an investigator to examine professional misconduct.", "Madam Speaker, this act is significant to the Legislature and the province because it proposes legislation that governs an institute and its professional members who are integral to so much of the work that’s done both in this Legislature and in municipalities across the province. Professional planners are the highly skilled and accredited professionals who help create, advise and help implement public policy and investments in all of our municipalities and regions. As many of you know, especially those members who served on municipal council, planners continuously identify community needs and develop short- and long-term plans to create, grow or revitalize a community or area. Regardless of whether you represent an urban or rural area or a small municipality, we all have planners, and they help to shape the policy that makes our communities great places to live, work and play.", "In my 17 years on municipal council, my now nearly three years as an MPP and my previous life in professional practice, I learned the intrinsic ability of planners to work collaboratively with other professionals in a range of disciplines, such as engineers, architects, environmental professionals and, dare I say it, even politicians. That’s the biggest benefit that they have, I suppose. As elected officials, we rely on planners to provide us with professional opinions on key policy matters.", "One thing can’t be emphasized enough: Professional planners play a crucial role in ensuring that Ontario and its various municipalities evolve in a way that protects our economic well-being, vital resources and healthy lifestyles.", "The timing of this bill is very important because of a number of key changes that have been enacted to planning in Ontario. Our government initiated a number of reforms to planning in 2015—Bill 73, the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act, and also changes to the Development Charges Act and the Planning Act. They resulted in improvements that gave municipalities more ability to fund growth, to have a greater say in how their communities grow, to make the development charges system more predictable, and to make planning and appeals more predictable. All of that depends on the advice of our professional planners.", "Of course, the historic investments our government is making in infrastructure also require professional planners to give advice on how to implement these decisions and also on how to help communities change their zoning and update their zoning bylaws to get the benefit from these infrastructure investments.", "Of course, the other key area that our government has undertaken a review of is our growth plans and our greenbelt. That relies, again, on the good advice of our professional planners and will rely on them going forward over the years to help implement these plans.", "So whatever one’s views are on these policies, we can all agree that without professional planners we cannot move forward on any of them.", "What this private member’s bill will do is help modernize this act. At one point, Ontario was the first jurisdiction in the country to have an act governing professional planners. We were leading the way in registering the professional planners’ designation and designating how the profession should be governed. But after close to 25 years, many other jurisdictions across the country have enacted more modern legislation and have leapfrogged us. That’s why it’s important in Ontario for us to update this legislation.", "This legislation will provide expanded title rights to planners so that the title Registered Professional Planner, or RPP, will remain protected and reserved for use by practising full members of the OPPI. The title of “professional planner” will be protected in other contexts.", "It’s also important to note that employers will continue to be able to choose whether they want to hire somebody with this designation or not.", "There will also be a holding-out provision that’s very important for public protection—so that a person does not represent themselves as a professional planner when they’re not registered as a member of the OPPI. This means that a person who reasonably thinks they’re hiring somebody to provide them planning advice will have a greater certainty of the credentials and accreditation of the person they’re hiring.", "Madam Speaker, after very lengthy discussions with the OPPI, we’ve come up with a clause that guarantees what that accreditation level will be and will protect the public at large. It will also give the OPPI the ability to level fines if, after a proper hearing, it’s determined that somebody has held themselves out to be a professional planner when in fact they’re not. We found a level of fine that’s comparable to other professions: a fine of $15,000, which will act as an effective deterrent.", "This bill will also provide new investigation powers to the OPPI so that they’ll have the ability to require an individual to provide documentation and evidence of what their credentials are, and also, in extreme circumstances, the ability to get a search warrant if it’s required.", "This bill does not create a regulated profession, as some other professions are, but it does give very important title protection to the profession of planners in this province. It provides the ability to ensure enforcement around the holdout provisions if a person provides services in the province of Ontario in the area of professional planning.", "Over the course of a year and a half, I’ve had the great privilege and honour of working with the women and men of the OPPI. Many of them I knew from my previous experience, but certainly working with them on the focus of what it means to have a well-regulated profession opened up my eyes even further to the great benefits that they provide to our communities, and to the provincial government as well, through the way that they offer their services, offer their advice and offer us an ability to look past the immediate and long into the future.", "When we discuss this act I would hope that all members of this House think keenly about how they might rely on a professional planner in their community; how their municipality might need the advice of a professional planner; how an individual wishing to make an investment in their community—to build a new structure, to develop a new parcel of land, to create a new subdivision, to create more housing and more affordable housing—how all of those individuals rely on the sound advice of a professional planner; and how important it is that, in an era where there are so many consultants, so many professionals out there, we all have a common language and a common understanding to understand who truly is accredited, has the experience, has the credentials and also has the accountability so that, when they offer advice, we know the true value and quality of that advice.", "I was very keenly aware also, in the drafting of this legislation, that there might be many smaller municipalities that don’t have the benefit of large planning staffs and what the impact might be. I did specifically ask the OPPI, as part of the consultation, to talk to AMO, to talk to some of those smaller municipalities, to get their input into this bill and also to provide reassurance that people who work as planners in those municipalities but who might not currently have this designation could continue to work for that municipality.", "We’re not creating a new regulatory regime that creates new costs or new barriers for small municipalities to employ people to provide them with the advice and the transactional abilities to process development applications. It was very important that we do that: to ensure that every municipality in this province can continue to govern itself and manage its resources as need be. Those who choose to use registered professional planners will be able to; those who choose not to will not be required to.", "But for rest of us, Madam Speaker, going forward, we’ll be able to have great confidence that when we speak to somebody with the designation of Registered Professional Planner we’ll be able to rely on their advice—to know that they will give us the best advice to help build our province up." ],

For that period, I was the chair of the planning and development committee. During that period, I came to appreciate that planners are skilled professionals who work to improve the quality and livability of Ontario communities—healthy and sustainable communities, Speaker.", "What’s clear in that process: As shifting policy objectives and competing interests in communities continue to evolve with social and technological changes, planners, in my belief, have a significant role in terms of encouraging Ontario residents to think about the public realm first and the role it can play in effectively developing healthy and sustainable communities.", "Planners do this by balancing the interests of communities and individuals—and what a balance it is—that I saw day in and day out by the commissioner of planning in the town of Whitby and, similarly, the commissioner of planning at the region of Durham, in effecting development of the eight communities that form the region of Durham, to ensure a short-, mid- and long-term objective of affordable, compact, diverse and livable communities.", "Professional planners, as my colleague from Etobicoke–Lakeshore pointed out, are represented by the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, and they represent over 4,000 professional planners in Ontario, many of whom were working at the town of Whitby, in the region of Durham. They have a wide suite of responsibilities, such as establishing the professional code of practice of its members, which is an important process in itself. Equally important, they also have a mandatory program of continuous professional learning as a requirement of membership, to ensure that members are current with modern practices—and ever more important when you have changes related to the provincial policy statement, the growth plan and other planning pieces as we go forward.", "More recently, the institute has been pursuing legislative changes to enable regulation of the planning profession, and that in itself is the catalyst for Bill 122. The bill proposes to repeal the Ontario Professional Planners Institute Act, 1994, and would enact what we’re debating today, the Registered Professional Planners Act, in its place. The bill would establish the powers and responsibilities of the Ontario Professional Planners Institute and its role as the representative organization of professional planners.", "While the Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus will be supporting this bill during second reading, we’re somewhat concerned about the timing of the bill. As you know, Speaker, Bill 68, the Modernizing Ontario’s Municipal Legislation Act, 2017, is also before the Legislature. When you step back and you look at that volume of legislative direction, it’s an omnibus bill which seeks to change over a dozen other laws in Ontario. While supportive of some aspects of Bill 68—there has been a broad discussion of that in this Legislature—which respond to requests from municipalities, such as definitions of meetings, expanding prudent investor rules and moving the start date for newly elected councils, we question why the government and the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore didn’t roll the proposed measures within Bill 122 into Bill 68.", "At the end of the day, we have a bill before us today that takes into account what I’ve certainly been hearing in my municipality through fairly regular interactions with some of the regional councillors in the region of Durham and the town of Whitby. It certainly reflects the direction that they would like to see, and certainly as a caucus we’re supportive of that direction." ],

It’s been almost 25 years since this act was updated, and certainly the time is now. It’s due.", "In terms of the bill itself, it’s pretty pro forma. It changes some of the credentialing, some of the accreditation, some of the fines etc. Again, all of this is for the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, and that’s fine. We’re good with that.", "It does give me an opportunity to talk about some of the initiatives that we’ve undertaken here around planning, because I speak, of course, as a downtown Torontonian, and my goodness, the city has exploded in the decades that I have lived here. Certainly the rate of development and the kind of development is a concern for everybody, I think, in downtown Toronto. We’re building a city the size of Kingston in the downtown core almost every year, just in terms of density. This is a phenomenal achievement, but it’s also a phenomenal challenge, and planners are absolutely at the core of that. Even in my riding, where condo development has picked up apace, it’s hard to keep up with the new developments, with the community meetings.", "Years ago, I introduced a bill to reform the Ontario Municipal Board, supported by the city of Toronto, to get the OMB out of the planning of the city of Toronto. It’s an unelected board; we don’t think it’s particularly responsive sometimes to the needs of constituents. We’ve had assurance from the government that reforming the OMB is also on their agenda, so I guess what I’m pleading for with the parliamentary assistant over there, the member for Etobicoke–Lakeshore, is that we get that reform of the OMB soon, because we’ve been fighting for it on this side of the aisle in the New Democratic Party for years. I think I’ve tabled that bill four or five times at this point. Whether it goes as far as we’re asking or does something, certainly something is needed.", "It’s interesting; in my riding, there are two very different communities represented. We have some of the wealthiest people in Toronto who live in my riding, and we have some of the poorest and most marginalized people in Toronto living in my riding. I won’t say where I was, but at one meeting in one part of the riding, I talked about OMB reform to huge cheers. Rental reform? Silence. In the other part of my riding, I talked about rental reform to huge cheers. The OMB? Silence. You can guess.", "But that’s the other bill that, of course, we’ve been fighting for. My colleague the member from Toronto–Danforth was really seminal on this, in bringing forward reforms to our rental processes here. Certainly, in the NDP, we’re on record going back a long time for more rent control because we’re losing that wonderful mix in our city, where people of all income levels can live. It’s becoming a city for wealthy people only. We have to fight back against that. That’s planning too.", "At any rate, the other issue, of course, for which I’ve been fighting for years and introducing bills multiple times, is inclusionary zoning. Again, we are one of the few cities of our size that doesn’t have some form of inclusionary zoning. The government has acquiesced. The government has brought something in on that. We’re a little concerned about some of the aspects of that bill, I have to say. We certainly think that our councillors and our planners have some flexibility where that’s concerned—with section 37 dollars, for example. It shouldn’t be an either/or situation. They should be able to have the flexibility of both when they’re looking at bringing more affordable housing into the mix.", "But again, that’s a response to having enclaves of the wealthy, enclaves of the not so wealthy and enclaves of the marginalized. We really need to be a city where those folk live together. That’s part of the diversity and richness of our community.", "I want to leave some time for my colleague from Toronto–Danforth.", "A pet beef is the historical legacies of our city. I’m going to Europe. I’m lucky; I’m going to Europe this summer. Of course, in Europe, when you think of the great cities of Europe, you think of cities that really value their historical legacy, their architecture. Yet here, often that’s left up to small groups of volunteers who have time on their hands to fight for a building or to fight for something. That is not the way it should be. We need more architecture and less archi-torture, if I can use that term, in our city. Again, planners are part of that process too.", "I know, as a United Church minister, we’re losing about a church a week across the country. Now, imagine losing a church a week in Europe. Again, not all churches are significant architecturally, but some are. This cannot be purely left up to dollars and cents, to the market. It can’t be left up to the market. It has to be planned. It has to have some input. There’s no single body here at fault for that. Certainly, we are all responsible for that, but again, planners are in the midst of that.", "I’m going to leave time, as I said, for the member from Toronto–Danforth, but I’ll just say that absolutely at no time in our history has planning been more important than right now. I’m happy to do anything to facilitate that process with professional planners. Updating this legislation that governs them is absolutely apropos, and of course we will support it." ],

My colleague from Parkdale–High Park spoke very well about the challenges that we are facing in the downtown core. I happen to represent a riding that is, I’ll say, half or at least half of downtown Toronto. We’ve seen unprecedented growth in the last 15 years. In Trinity–Spadina, if you go anywhere south of College now, you’ll see cranes and construction sites, condominiums, and commercial buildings are popping up as well.", "Professional planners play a key role in the devolvement—or gentrification, in many cases, in my riding—of our community. Every time I go to a meeting where the developer will consult with the community, I always want to wait and listen to the advice and insightful knowledge provided by the planner because the stuff that they look at, the stuff that they have to think about goes beyond what most of the people in the room would initially react to.", "I think this is a very good bill. I’ll take this opportunity to talk about some of the challenges that I’ve been hearing in my riding. Thinking back, three years ago when I was knocking on doors, people kept telling me that a lot of planning was not done respecting the process, respecting the thoughts and suggestions from the residents in the community.", "I think it’s so important that, in that process, whether it’s one condo or whether it’s a whole strip of redevelopment, we must listen to our constituents. We must listen to people who live in those communities and respect their views.", "I know the government has done quite a bit of work on that through the modernization of the Planning Act; as well, we are in the process of reforming the OMB, making sure that local voices are heard at those levels. As well, I spoke to the inclusionary zoning bill, brought in by the government last year. I know it’s in the works, and I hope to see it in its official form adopted by the city of Toronto, because it’s going to add a lot more affordable units and bring players—stakeholders like co-ops—officially into the planning and into that search for a solution for more affordable housing around Toronto.", "One more thing that I must add is that we also, in the planning of our city and its redevelopment, must look at heritage buildings. We have so many heritage buildings in the downtown Toronto core—downtown Toronto, I speak to—and we’re not doing a good job of protecting them. We’re not providing an incentive for these heritage building owners to do what they need to do to keep these properties.", "In the States, people are proud to have a heritage building, but here they feel that they’re a burden when it comes to upkeep, retrofitting and maintaining these buildings. They feel they’re left out. There is less support, they feel, coming from all three levels of government. So I think we’ve got to do a better job in supporting those heritage building owners.", "I’ll leave some time to my good colleagues to speak to this bill as well.", "I urge all members of this House to support this very timely, very needed bill." ],

At the same time, we’re on the cusp of a significant shift in our province’s population growth and development to match that transformation. Clearly, it’s time for an update, and this legislation is an important step in laying the foundation for that coming transformation.", "I will be supporting this bill because it’s time to bring it up to date, but also because I support the accountability piece, and that is protecting the Ontario consumer by making the planning profession accountable to the people through various changes; namely, ensuring consumers are receiving evidence and advice from accredited professionals.", "The proposed act would continue to protect the title of Registered Professional Planner, or RPP, and reserve its use for practising full members of the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, OPPI, which is 4,500 members strong today. The title of “professional planner” would also be protected, except when used in a different context, such as a financial professional planner in a bank.", "At the same time, the bill would prevent people from identifying themselves as a professional planner, and thereby prohibit just anyone from providing a professional opinion on planning matters, which is key in ensuring the consumer is protected. The proposal is also to penalize anyone who is not a member of the institute but uses its preferred acronyms or designations—to be held liable and face a $15,000 fine. Furthermore, the act would also specify more precisely the duties of the regulator, which is the institute, OPPI. The act would also make it a mandatory requirement to have public members serve on council.", "Altogether, these changes, I believe, will do both: provide better title protection of professional planners and increase accountability to the people of Ontario.", "I would now like to give a local perspective on this bill, and share some of the feedback that I received from my constituents.", "Randy Scherzer, who is Grey county’s director of planning, supports this legislation, which, he adds, is already in place in other jurisdictions. He believes this change will bring stronger accountability to those who are tasked with the decision to grow and develop our communities.", "Liz Buckton, who works as a senior planner with the municipality of Meaford and is a member of OPPI, believes Bill 122 will strengthen accountability and the ability of communities to make better planning decisions in the public interest.

The question that local planners had to take into account was: How did this proposal affect local planning regulations, local landowners and future growth?", "In the end, the decision was that the proposed expansion not proceed, which pleased my constituents, who had argued all along that the current planning policies, together with conservation authority regulations and policies, already manage growth and protect the natural environment.", "Clearly, land use and development decisions are critical.

You have a long history with my riding, and I’m pleased that you have that history. As you may well be aware, we are a fairly well-developed neighbourhood already but one going through substantial changes in the decades to come.", "As with my colleague at Parkdale–High Park—the role of the Ontario Municipal Board and its function when it comes to supporting or opposing municipal decisions on planning is critical. Planners are crucially necessary to dealing with the intensification of cities so that that intensification can take place in a way that preserves those human values, that allows us to have walkable streets, allows us to go down streets that aren’t wind tunnels but really are pleasant, intensified avenues.", "I know from talking to my constituents that there have been, over the years, a number of planning issues which for them have been critical. One of the ones that are going on right now is along Broadview Avenue, which runs parallel to the Don Valley north of the Danforth, the section that I’m interested in at this point. The city of Toronto has engaged in a process of planning along there, looking at some intensification, but an intensification that would fit in with the existing fabric of the neighbourhood.", "There is huge concern amongst the people who live along Broadview that the plan that has been brought forward by the city and was the subject of an extensive consultation, extensive debate, something that most people can support, and if they can’t support it they can live with it—but there are those others who are not interested in the plan as it is written, as it has been proposed, who want to intensify far more than what has been proposed. I think that what has been brought forward by the city is sensible.", "The appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board undermines support for intensification when you don’t have the buy-in from the community around the area. There’s no doubt in my mind that there will be planners who will be brought into this matter to argue. But in many ways, Speaker, and you’re well aware of this, often the OMB just ignores what the planners have to say.", "I talk to my colleagues who are councillors in the city of Toronto. The member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore, I’m sure, has been there. He has been on that council, but he has also talked to people about development proposals that are out of scale, that don’t make sense in a particular area. Far too often, sensible planning advice and decisions made by a municipality—and I’ll talk about the city of Toronto right now—get ignored at the Ontario Municipal Board. It’s as if planning didn’t exist. And if it exists, it is seen as an obstacle to making a big bag of cash from a particular piece of property.", "I’ll give you another example, a much smaller street in my riding: Albemarle, south of the Danforth. It’s a very nice street with two- and three-storey houses on the side of a hill, so it’s got a very interesting gradient. On the north side of the street, you have to go up about two storeys to get to the front porch and then go up the front porch to the door. On the south side of the street, everything is at ground level, with the houses, behind the front, dropping down into a ravine.", "A recent fight on that street in the last two years was against a proposal to put in a large cube in the midst of houses that really have that traditional Riverdale look—peaked roofs, a porch that’s comfortable to sit out on in good weather—introducing an urban house form that reflects nothing of the history and nothing of the architectural detailing that’s there. I should just add that although the city of Toronto didn’t support it and although the residents opposed it, the OMB overruled everyone and plunked it in the middle of that street, creating this really discordant sense of what that street is and what it should look like in the future.", "Having regulated, capable planners whose opinions are weighed by municipal politicians—in large municipalities and small ones—and applying their advice without having the OMB overrule them all the time is going to be critical. So what the member has brought forward is a good bill. It just needs further action: in particular, bringing the OMB to heel; but in the city of Toronto, a big enough jurisdiction—larger than many provinces—letting the city of Toronto make its own planning decisions. It hires professional planners. Let them do their work. Let us respect their work." ],

It was very helpful.", "As many of you know, I served on city council before I came here. It was a council that functioned very well and one that I was proud to serve on.", "I understand the reasoning behind this move to allow municipalities to make decisions about school safety zones.", "When I spoke on this bill previously, I noted how important it would be for us to not only listen to the concerns of city representatives or councillors, but I also noted how creating municipal independence was an important part of this legislation. As a city councillor, it became clear that council was a great resource to use to really understand the issues of a community. Sometimes, like the case here, when you listen to the local concerns of city councillors, you begin to realize that certain communities can be facing significant local issues, like school closures and road safety.", "I said before that a one-size solution isn’t always the best approach. When it comes to road safety, there can be a local solution that has positive impacts. In this case, the legislation is allowing them to make those decisions about safety zones and speed limits, and as a former councillor and as a member of this House, I support community safety zones. Local decisions must be listened to.", "I’ll talk about Niagara Falls for a minute. I might have got to it yesterday, but I’m not sure. In Niagara Falls, we have an area on Kalar Road. There are four schools within a small area. Three are public; one’s a high school. The council I sat on a couple of years ago—it’s almost four years ago now—decided to have a school safety zone. It was carried unanimously by the local committee and supported by the community, which is also important. We lowered the speed limit and we had a school safety zone. I’m pleased to say that we might have had the odd near-miss, but we haven’t had a serious accident since we did that in that area.", "The one thing I want to discuss today, because when I was at committee I listened to the PCs talk about this in some of their motions and amendments—the one thing I thought was important is that they had put forward an amendment to talk about a certain time. What’s important when you do school safety zones is not about whether it’s from 8 o’clock till 4 o’clock; it has got to be all the time. What we tried to do, and we’re trying to do it even more in the province of Ontario because of the number of schools and the further out the schools are becoming—we want to make sure our kids are safe using those facilities not just during school hours but after.", "We have a lot of daycare centres in schools today. We have soccer leagues that use schoolyards at night, whether that’s for games or for practices; and baseball diamonds. So to have a school safety zone that is only from 8 in the morning till 4 in the afternoon doesn’t really make a lot of sense. Our council of the day decided to have it 24 hours a day. Make sure the residents know that it’s a school safety zone, and make sure they know it’s 50 kilometres down that way—probably better to go to 40 and then to 30, but that hasn’t happened yet. But it’s important to know that that council and the community made that decision. That’s why it’s important in this bill to continue to do that.", "Local government is the level of government that is most connected to the residents; it’s on the front lines, so to speak. So when they feel that an area in their town or city maybe falls under 50 kilometres, they should be able to dictate that. That part, if I understand it, is proper, and I can certainly get behind it.", "Before we discussed this bill at the committee stage, I went forward and spoke with the mayors in our riding about the bill. I wanted to hear first-hand from them what they thought about the legislation.", "Speaker, as you are aware, Niagara Falls is a very diverse riding. It has many different and charming communities that make it up. The three main communities are Niagara Falls; Niagara-on-the-Lake, which I know a lot of my fellow MPPs have gone to; and Fort Erie. There are many other small communities that exist within these main towns and cities—those are ones with councils and mayors—like Ridgeway, Crystal Beach, St. Davids, Queenston and Virgil. There are many of those that I just listed.", "With that being said, Niagara has many different opinions and views on how their towns, their cities and their communities should function or be legislated by the province.", "Here’s the important point: You don’t get this a lot, but all three mayors agreed that this was a good piece of public policy. I’m going to repeat that, for those that aren’t listening: All three mayors agreed that this was a good piece of public policy—all three of them.", "I think that is important to mention because when we were in the clause-by-clause section of committee, and amendments to the bill were presented, we saw something interesting from the PC members. With nearly 300 amendments, they re-used the same amendments over and over again—exact wording, but simply switching out the street names. Many of these happened to be in my riding of Niagara Falls.", "Here are the street names that they decided to use in my riding, many of which were listed in the wrong city. In Fort Erie, it was Thompson Road, Stevensville Road—I want to list these, because I think it’s important—Central Avenue, Lyons Creek Road, Netherby Road, Bowen Road and Gilmore Road.", "Do you know what’s interesting about those roads being named? I went to that mayor, Mr. Wayne Redekop, mayor of Fort Erie, and I asked him, “Knowing this, do you still support the bill? Do you believe that we should have school safety zones? Do you support Bill 65?” Do you know what the mayor said? I’ll give you some of his quotes later in my speech, but he said, “Absolutely.”", "Then I took a look at some of the amendments, some of the motions coming forward, on Niagara-on-the-Lake. They named the streets. This was a piece of paper that had one motion with the name of a street, and then they’d go to the next one. In Niagara-on-the-Lake, it was Four Mile Creek Road, Airport Road, Niagara Townline Road and Niagara Stone Road.", "Again, in fairness to the motion, I went and talked to the local mayor. In this case, it’s kind of interesting. He’s called the Lord Mayor in Niagara-on-the-Lake—I always find that interesting—Mr. Pat Darte. And he said that, absolutely, he supports it.", "From there, I took a look at the amendments and the motions put forward, and they listed, on a separate piece of paper, every street for Niagara Falls. In Niagara Falls, it was Kalar Road—the schools that I just mentioned are there, four schools almost right together; Beaverdams Road, where there are a couple of schools up that end; McLeod Road and Highway 20.", "I wanted to mention this, because when I saw those amendments, I spoke to the mayors. As I’ve already mentioned, those mayors all support Bill 65, the Safer School Zones Act. They support the province giving them the ability to make the call when a safety zone is needed.", "I even have a quote here from the mayor of Niagara Falls, Mayor Jim Diodati, that I’d like to read out regarding Bill 65. I thought it was pretty good. He took the time out, and he sent it to us. I want to thank the mayor, Jim Diodati, for doing that.", "“The safety of our young people is of utmost importance. We are most supportive of the ability to implement security tools in these zones and are grateful for the autonomy being provided to municipalities to be able to make these necessary changes in areas that require special care and attention.” I think that’s pretty important.", "There is a key word in the quote from the Niagara Falls mayor: autonomy. Having been a councillor, I understand that. This isn’t being pushed down from the province. They’re saying to the municipalities, “You know your communities better. Your elected town councils know your communities better. Your citizens know your communities better.” So I think the autonomy part of this bill is so, so important, and one that we should support. That is a really important aspect of what this bill does. It gives municipalities the message that says, “Hey, we trust you. You know where and when there’s an issue with road safety in your community.”", "Mr. Speaker, we must trust municipalities to make that call. We can’t make it from here. We know what the PC Party thinks about municipal governments in Ontario. After spending their time in government downloading service after service onto municipalities, why would they ensure that municipalities have the autonomy to make their own decisions on issues like the one we’re debating here today?", "With that being said, I’d like to discuss some of the city representatives, or city councillors, who came forward with very compelling and important information when this bill was discussed at committee.", "I’d first like to discuss the presentation we received from the Ward 5 traffic safety committee of Newmarket. I found the information that was brought forward very interesting. In 2013, Nancy Fish launched a “slow down” campaign up in Newmarket. This was a response to the increased speeding and dangerous driving they had witnessed on the streets in their community. It was also in response to the tragic death of Georgia Walsh in Leaside in July 2014. I’ll be speaking further about that tragic incident later in my remarks.", "Both Nancy and Bob Kwapis got together with one of their local construction companies in town and acquired lawn signs. I know the members in this House understand the importance of lawn signs and how effective they can be in conveying a strong message. I can confidently say that I know we’ve all used them, maybe once or twice—and used them again and again and again.", "These lawn signs told people in the area to slow down, and they were effective. The PCs raised this issue about using other avenues. People in the area began to recognize the signs and started to slow down, which was good. They were so successful that some of their lawn signs went missing and ended up in neighbouring communities such as Markham and Sutton. Ultimately, they were very successful in alerting the town to the danger of speeding, and pressed the town to create a traffic mitigation plan for the municipality.", "While all of this sounds great, and some in the House might be asking why we don’t just legislate “slow down” lawn signs in municipalities, rather than creating school safety zones, here’s what happened. It’s important to listen to this: People stopped paying attention and went right back to speeding.", "I’d like to read a quote from Nancy, who presented at the committee: “All of this sounds wonderful, but the fact is that the signs lost their effectiveness. The town has worked on its traffic mitigation plan, but capital costs for re-engineering roads and/or adding speed bumps have hindered its advancement. People are not slowing down.", "“One of the top concerns among the citizenry of Newmarket is speeding, yet many people do not slow down unless it’s on their own street. People are so time-deprived”—I think we can all relate to that, being MPPs—“that aggressive driving has become the norm. Those speeding are not just young kids; they are dads coming home from work, they’re soccer moms, they’re people going to appointments—they’re ‘everyman.’” That was a quote from Nancy from Newmarket.", "“Unfortunately, these drivers do not seem to be aware of the real dangers their speeding poses to pedestrians, seniors, other vehicles and, most importantly, our children. On my street, which has a 40-kilometre speed limit, drivers are going 20 to 40 kilometres over the limit—20 kilometres over the speed limit is 50% over the speed limit, and 40 kilometres over the speed limit is twice the limit. These are dangerous drivers....", "“Some argue that automated speed enforcement systems are not effective, or that they penalize the wrong person. I beg to differ. If I received a speeding ticket in the mail, it would affect my driving. I would be filled with remorse and embarrassment that I had broken the law with my dangerous action. Added to this, I don’t have unlimited funds to pay traffic fines.”", "I wanted to read that quote because I think that’s important. This person understands their community, actively works to address the speeding problem in their community and now fully understands what needs to happen to protect our kids and our grandkids.", "I’d also like to discuss another presentation from a city councillor during the committee stage of the bill. Councillor Catherine McKenney from the city of Ottawa brought forward a very compelling point when we discussed road safety and having an appropriate level of funding for transit. If this government is serious about road safety, they must step up to the plate and deliver on the necessary funding commitments to transit expansion. She’s from Ottawa.", "Councillor McKenney noted—listen to this, please; people at home should listen to this—that 148 people died on Ottawa streets between 2010 and 2014; 36 on foot, 12 on motorcycles and 15 on bikes. This is unacceptable and I know this is a big issue in Toronto as well. And for the MPPs who are here from Toronto, they certainly know it all too well.", "Another presentation, from Walk Toronto, highlighted some of these problems. I’ll be speaking to that later in these discussions.", "However, the councillor raised a great point: For a fulsome approach to road safety, we need to invest in quality transit options. I don’t think this government has invested in enough high-quality transit options for the province. Again, this is a councillor from Ottawa saying this and that’s why I thought it was important.", "I know the government has told us that they have to sell off Hydro One to raise money for infrastructure and transit. Quite frankly—I have raised this before—the sell-off of Hydro One is one of the biggest mistakes this government or any government in the province has ever made. I said it this morning twice; I’m saying it this this afternoon; I’m going to continue to say it.", "I want to take some of my time to talk about the importance of municipal independence and discuss the presentations we had from municipal representatives, but what I really want to speak about is the impact that this has on schools and the feedback we’ve had from school representatives and parents.", "As I mentioned before in this House, my wife was a teacher and a principal. I spoke with her regularly about the issues surrounding schools and she has always mentioned road safety as a major issue her entire career. Injuries or death have the ability to seriously affect the well-being of an entire school, the whole school community, including our much-valued teachers.", "She worked in the school system her whole adult life. My two daughters, whom I’m extremely proud of—I have three, but two of them are in the Catholic school system. I can’t imagine how much an injury to one of their students would affect them. It’s terrible to even think about it.", "Unfortunately, from the presentations we receive from school representatives and parents facing life-threatening road safety issues, it’s a reality. It certainly is a reality in Toronto and the GTA.", "I know you’ll be interested in this, Mr. Speaker, because I think we all should be. I’d like to discuss one of the schools that presented to us during the committee stages. They had their principal and their parent association from Allenby school in Toronto, which is at the corner of St. Clements and Avenue Road. They came to committee and presented the serious challenge they were having with speeding and reckless driving near their school.", "The principal, Tracey O’Toole, provided the committee with a really good background on issues affecting this school. I’d like to quote some of her presentation, as hard as it was for her to do it.", "“The area serving our school is densely populated, with much vehicular traffic in and around our school zone. Most of this traffic is on Avenue Road”—the MPPs from Toronto would know Avenue Road better than me—“a major thoroughfare in the city of Toronto providing motorists a four-lane north-south artery.” It’s right beside the school.", "It “is marked as a school zone with flashing signs posted alerting motorists to a reduced speed of 40 kilometres”—I talked about Niagara Falls, where ours was 50; they actually had theirs posted to 40, because we all know that the slower you go, the less chance of severe injury and death—“during school times.” Listen to this: “These signs have proven ineffective in slowing the speed of traffic on Avenue Road.”", "The school is dealing with serious, serious road safety problems. This is the principal talking. This is not just a few speeding motorists and an overprotective principal.", "Here are some of the details from Lisa Parker, chair of and volunteer with the parent association of the school. “[O]ur school is located in midtown Toronto and is bordered by Avenue Road on the east side of the property. The enrolment boundaries are such that our students are crossing Avenue Road and walking along Avenue Road to get to” and from school every day.", "“According to city of Toronto transportation services, Avenue Road is categorized as an arterial road. Its primary function is to deliver traffic to and from the 401 at the highest level of service possible.", "“Despite its use as a major artery, the 2.3-kilometre stretch of Avenue Road that exists in our community not only includes our school but also a city park, two nursery schools, a seniors’ residence, a private school and a high school.” Think about that. “This stretch of Avenue Road is characterized by sidewalks that are right up against the four-lane roadway. There are at least seven posted speeds.”", "This number should jump out at all of us—I know my colleague in front of me knows this area well: Over 4,000 students attend schools that are located on that stretch. I know the education minister is listening intently, and I appreciate that. There are 4,000 students in that area.", "I know some of the members are familiar with this area just north of us. It’s a major hub of the community. It is clear that not only are they dealing with speeding issues, but they also have a large number of students walking the streets.", "Unfortunately, Allenby has witnessed the reality of speeding and dangerous driving, including distraction from texting while they’re driving. Between April 6 and April 16, emergency services were dispatched three separate times for several car accidents in the area. That’s a 10-day period. They’ve had six accidents in their school zone since August 2016. Let me repeat that: six accidents in their school zone in less than a year.", "This school has also witnessed their own teaching staff injured due to being struck by a vehicle three years ago. I know that the education minister will feel for this. Two teachers were struck and severely injured as they walked across Avenue Road. Their injuries were so serious that it resulted in the end of their teaching careers. How sad is that? This needless accident ended the careers of those teachers. Quite frankly, we’re just looking out for our kids and our grandkids.", "If this isn’t evidence enough that we must allow municipalities and schools to make a decision about creating safety zones, I’m not sure what is. Can you imagine how this has impacted the teachers and the staff of this school? And not just the teachers and staff in the school; can you imagine what it did to that teacher’s family? Their mom went to school in the morning to teach and came home so injured that she could never work again. You’re not just affecting the school area when you have an accident like this; you’re affecting the students, who are going to go home and talk to their parents; the other teachers; and then the family of the two who were injured—their kids, their husbands, their partners, their aunts, their uncles. Everybody gets affected by this. I just don’t know how anybody can’t understand the importance of doing this.", "I believe that Principal O’Toole put it quite well: “I keep this in mind each time I run from my office to Avenue Road with news that yet another accident has occurred, hoping that no member of our community has been seriously injured. We have been working tirelessly to create a safer community.”", "To the credit of the parent association and the principal, they have not remained idle. They showed that by coming to our committee the other day. They participated in a pilot project with the Toronto Police Service, pulling vehicles over that were going 55 kilometres or more, which is 15 over the speed limit. Listen to this: They pulled over at least 30 vehicles in one hour. One vehicle, they clocked at 75 kilometres. This is 40 kilometres over the speed limit. My math isn’t very good; it’s actually 35, and I wrote this. But at least I corrected it." ],

The presentations not only highlighted the accidents that have happened outside this school but also highlighted that a school area can be a community hub.", "Speaking with the representatives from the school, it became quite clear that the schools and the buildings in this area are used all the time, day and night. You can understand that with 4,000 students in that small area, they’re going to be at the schools.", "This is important for my colleagues the PCs to listen to, because that was one of their motions. This means that more people are travelling either by foot or by car in this area—even more reason to ensure that the area is safe and speed limits are enforced.", "I believe this is true for more than just this school. I think a lot of schools in Ontario serve as community hubs. These examples are absolutely tragic. It seems like a miracle that no child has been injured in this particular school zone.", "While no child has been injured or killed in this particular school zone, other parts of Toronto were unfortunately not so lucky. Just a couple weeks ago, before they brought their presentation to committee, we learned of the tragic news that a young boy and his mother had been struck by a car in Scarborough after leaving their school. Unfortunately, the boy passed away from his injuries. I cannot even begin to understand how this has impacted his family. The details on this tragic death are still not fully known, but I believe it is important for us to highlight it.", "There are real-life consequences to how we drive. In this case, it happened to be this young child’s life. He was only six years old. No child should leave their home and never come back from school.", "Another terrible tragedy we witnessed in Ontario was the death of a young girl hit by a car in the Leaside area of Toronto. The girl was also six years old. While in this case it was not a school zone, it’s another unfortunate example of how unsafe driving or exceeding the speed limit can result in the destruction of families and communities.", "Discussing these tragedies leads into another important presentation that we received at committee on this bill. We had a presentation from Maureen Coyle from Walk Toronto. Walk Toronto is an advocacy group focused on the creation of safe, equitable and accessible use of public space which fosters a walking culture in the city—again, Toronto is what she’s talking about. What was really important to highlight from that presentation wasn’t directly related to just school zones, but generally about some of the serious issues facing pedestrian injuries in the city of Toronto.", "I’d like to actually quote some of Maureen’s presentation regarding road safety in Toronto, if I may, Mr. Speaker—Madam Speaker. I see you’ve changed. Welcome back. An hour is a long time. You go for a break and I don’t.", "Listen to this: “In 2016, we saw among the highest pedestrian deaths this century in Toronto, with 43 deaths on the road—46 when you include private parking areas like malls, for example, which are not covered under the Highway Traffic Act and which are not kept in police statistics.” Remember, this is coming from Maureen. “There were an additional 39 people reported killed—pedestrians, specifically—on OPP-enforced roadways. The data from other municipalities for 2016 are not readily available to the public at this point. However, in the first nine years of this century, Toronto, Mississauga, Hamilton and Ottawa together accounted for almost 500 pedestrian fatalities....", "“Lower speeds are proven to reduce fatalities of pedestrians and other ... road users. The survivability of an impact with a vehicle increases with a corresponding ... speed. The Chief Coroner’s report notes, ‘There is a well-established impact of vehicle speed on death, where ... the fatality risk at 50 km/hr being more than twice as high as the risk at 40 km/hr and more than five times higher than ... at 30 km/hr.’”", "That is a lot to unpack, but I think there are two important pieces in that information. One is that the number of pedestrian deaths in 2016, which was noted by Maureen, is the highest this century.", "The second important piece of information from this quote is the fact that a reduction in speed has a serious impact on the chance of survival in the case of a collision. A five-times decrease in the risk from 40 to 30—I think that is significant and should be considered when we look at this bill. It’s pretty obvious what to take from this. Pedestrians are dying in this province, particularly in Toronto, from collisions with cars, and if those cars aren’t speeding, they have a much better chance of survival of an accident. The coroner’s report that was referenced here lists the top five reasons of cause of death by accidents, and the number one—anybody know? Speed. It’s just another example of why this legislation makes sense and why I’ve said all along that the NDP and myself would support it.", "Another point that was raised by Maureen was the economic costs of those accidents. Here’s another quote from her presentation:", "“A report from Toronto Public Health in 2012 stated, ‘Savings in direct health care costs arising from current levels of Toronto residents staying active by walking or cycling and averting chronic illnesses are estimated to reduce health care spending of $110 million to $160 million.’” That’s big money. “‘In terms of indirect costs, if estimates of lost productivity or the economic value of a life are included’ in the cost of chronic illness ‘the total economic benefits of active transportation ... range from $130 million to $478 million.’", "“On the other hand”—I hate using this word but I will—“a conservative estimate of costs of road fatalities puts the burden on the city of Toronto at $600 million. The fines generated through electronic enforcement is not a cash grab.” It is not a cash grab. “It is a fraction of the economic costs of pedestrian deaths and serious injury—which, in turn, does nothing to recognize the impact on communities and families when a death or a serious injury results from road violence.”", "I think this is an important point to make, one that we definitely forget about. Obviously the lives lost are the most important reason to support the bill, but we can’t forget about the financial impact.", "Madam Speaker, when this bill went into committee and after we received all these wonderful presentations, we then experienced something interesting. I think you might call it some political games: playing games with a bill that really is always about protecting our kids and our grandkids.", "I’d like to discuss some of the amendments that were put forward. One of the amendments stated that a speed enforcement system would only be used in an area where the rate of motor vehicle accidents is at least 33% higher than the average for that class of roadway over the previous three-year period. Think about that. I had a line there but I’m not going to use it. I thought it was a completely ridiculous motion that added nothing to this bill and only served to disrupt an important debate about improving the safety of our children.", "There’s another amendment that I think would classify as political games or using weasel words to skirt about the core of this bill. This amendment asked for the use of photo radar systems. I want you to listen to this, and I want my buddies from the PCs to listen to this, too, because it made no sense to me. I just went wild, by the way.", "This amendment asked for the use of photo radar systems in school zones only from September to June, from 30 minutes before the earliest school opening in the school zone and 30 minutes after. Now, think about that. We’re talking about schools as community hubs. We’re talking about soccer teams. We’re talking about baseball teams. We’re talking about daycares. A lot of daycares use schools across the province of Ontario. Not only did this amendment continue to disrupt an important debate on improving the safety of our children and added nothing to the bill, it also completely ignored the fact that many of these schools act as community hubs.", "I know in my riding of Niagara Falls many of the schools have constant activities right through the year because they operate as a community hub and offer more than daily school services. I may repeat a little bit of this, but there are daycare centres, soccer practices, football and, with our changing sports, rugby in a lot of our schools now, especially with the artificial turfs that are out there, and baseball games. Children from the community come and play on the school equipment all the time. As a matter of fact, as a parent, when you’ve got a little one, where do you go? Certainly, in Niagara Falls we’ve got lots of parks. Where do you go? Particularly with families that don’t have the money to go on vacation, they go enjoy their parks. That’s what they do. They stay home—stay-vacations.", "I understand that these amendments are in the past and have been voted down by the committee, but I think it’s important to highlight the type of attitude that the PCs have taken with this bill and how they feel about the safety of our kids. I want to be clear, because they’re here. I’m going to say it to their—I don’t climb on anybody’s back. I’m going to say this as clear as I can: I have no idea why they did the amendments that they did. I don’t believe that anybody—and I’m going to be clear on this—I don’t believe that anybody of the 107 MPPs who are elected by the province of Ontario, by the residents, doesn’t care about their kids. I think we all care about our kids. I think we all care about our grandkids. I want to be clear on that.", "What I’m talking about is the amendments that were brought forward that I don’t think, probably, should have been brought forward, and certainly some of the ones that I’m discussing today. So I’m not saying anything bad about anybody in this House. I think everybody loves their kids. We want our kids to go to school and come home. But when you put amendments together like this, I think it’s a mistake, when you’re doing a bill on something as serious as this; when we know—we know, and I said it—two 6-year-old children have been killed. They might be here today if this bill was in place then.", "I’ve already spoken about the fact that the former leader, now mayor of Toronto, John Tory—and this is important too. I should have said this before I said what I just did. I have already spoken about the fact that the former leader and now mayor of Toronto, John Tory, actually asked for revenue tools for the city of Toronto, so I won’t talk about that again. But he actually asked for the same thing.", "However, I think we need to address this claim that these systems are cash cows. I know I’ve heard that word phrase used a lot: cash grab, not “cash cow”—sorry.", "I asked many of the passionate presenters at the committee what they thought about this being used as a cash grab. I would like to share some of that with you, some of their responses.", "Our presenter from Walk Toronto, Maureen Coyle, had this to say: “I think we have a culture that has been created that allows us to dismiss real-life experience as soon as we drag out the ‘cash grab.’ You know, my mother was a librarian. She used to tell me about people coming in and putting their 15 cents on the table for their overdue book, thinking that was how she made her living. It may not be that far off, but that cash grab is not how anybody in this room makes their living. Yes? That cash grab, that money collected from those fines, needs to be put back, and very clearly put back, in a transparent way, into the creation of safe infrastructure and safe strategies, and other ways....", "“To allow an argument as” basic “as that, especially when compared, as I have suggested, to the overwhelming costs of ignoring this problem; the overwhelming costs to municipalities of having productive members of their communities taken suddenly, through trauma; the knock-on trauma on families in general because of these kinds of incidents; the loss of productivity; the court time; the health care facilities’ time—all of these have a huge impact.”", "Here’s another comment from Lisa Parker, head of the Allenby Parents’ Association, on the idea that this is a cash grab: “Automated speed enforcement has been referred to as a cash grab by some. However, in the case of protecting our school zones, we think it would be better referred to as a convenience fee. If a motorist would like the convenience of speeding in our school zones and putting our children’s lives at risk, then they should pay for that convenience. The cost of the convenience should be high enough that motorists think twice about putting our children’s lives at risk.” That came from a parent group where they’ve had all kinds of problems.", "The third comment came from Mr. Yu Li, from Friends and Families for Safe Streets: “First, we think that people who endanger other people’s lives and break laws by speeding should pay the price. Second, evidence shows that the public is more amenable to safety cameras if they know that the revenues from speeding fines are earmarked for safety-oriented street redesign projects, such as narrowing lane widths to accommodate bike lanes and transit lanes ... and/or wider sidewalks. We ask that Bill 65 designate revenues for this purpose to ensure public support. Third, the real reason we want safety cameras is not for the revenue but to actually slow down cars.” I’m going to reread that; I like that one. “Third, the real reason we want safety cameras is not for the revenue but to actually slow down cars.”", "After these comments from Mr. Li, I asked him about the tragic death of the six-year-old boy in Scarborough, and if he felt this would have saved lives or been a cash grab. This was his response: “I don’t think that’s a cash grab. How much are you willing to pay for this six-year-old’s life? Please ask yourself: How much are you willing to pay for the six-year-old’s life?”", "I think this quote really sums up everything nicely for us. This bill is about saving lives and protecting communities, and I support that." ],

One of the biggest dangers on our roads here in Ontario is speed—the member from Niagara Falls spoke to that—and especially the speed around schools. I can’t tell you how many times—perhaps not so many now that I sit in this House at this hour—I would pick up my boys after school and would just see the cars flying by the stop signs, right at the time when the school buses are crossing intersections and at the time when families and parents and grandparents are picking up their children.", "It is important that we have measures in place and give the municipalities the tools so that they can put the appropriate measures in place, like the ones that we are suggesting with Bill 65, that would monitor and that would take pictures of the cars that are speeding.

McGregor, a great school. Interestingly, in a group of about 30 or 40 kids, three of them got up to talk about safety in their school zones and how a number of them had barely escaped being run down crossing at a crosswalk. So I don’t think there’s any question. I think the member has nailed it well: There are substantial safety problems with speeding cars, particularly in school zones. Families and children need to have the confidence that everything is being done to ensure the safety of those children when they go to and from school.", "I’ve had the opportunity to go past school zones in a variety of schools in my riding, and there’s no getting around it: There is a small percentage of drivers who do not pay attention to what’s going on on the street, who don’t care that they’re going through a school zone and are willing to go at an extraordinary speed. It is a huge risk for kids. It simply is a huge risk.

In terms of allowing cameras on school buses, they are allowed. The ministry does permit school bus drivers to have these cameras on the bus. As the member indicated, there are a number of pilots under way in Ontario. But for the charges to be able to stick”—and this what people have to understand, and I hope everybody is listening to this, “we need to ensure, working with the Ministry of the Attorney General, that the evidentiary rules around what the camera photograph or video shows needs to be articulated clearly so that those elements that I described are clear for a POA officer or for a judge to determine that the offence was committed accurately.”", "According to the experts—not Wayne Gates; the experts—the technology today isn’t in place to do both, meaning the arm out and getting the lights at the same time.

It’s absurd to think that I believe, or that anyone in the PC caucus believes, that we shouldn’t have safer schools, that we shouldn’t have more protection for our children.

Anything we can do to prevent that is beneficial.", "The concern that we have, then, when it comes to Bill 65, the Safer School Zones Act, 2017, is that when you allow—and this is the concern: by addressing the ability of municipalities to set speed limits within their borders without really meaningful restrictions you have the potential—and I’m not saying it would necessarily happen, but I am saying there is definitely the potential that we see an abuse of this power. There’s the potential that we see this position being brought forward in a way that would create not just safer school zones, but in their argument we would see—sorry, my argument, then, and my approach is that we have to ensure we have safer school zones, but we have to be careful that we don’t have radars in as many areas where they’re simply not needed and where they’re unnecessary and where they do lead to increased revenues.", "The reason for this is something—honestly, I’m confused when I read some of the prior estimations that have been brought forward in this Legislature by other members who have spoken about this. The reality is that not only on this side of the House but on that side of the House—the current government party, when they were in opposition in the 1990s, when they spoke to legislation that the then government, but currently the third party—when they brought forward legislation that talked about increasing the use of not school safety zones, but talked about using photo radar, many people spoke out against it. In fact, the former finance minister, Greg Sorbara, spoke out against it in 1993; the former Minister of Natural Resources—Gerry Phillips, I believe his name was—spoke out against it in 1993. As recently as 2007, the former Premier, Dalton McGuinty, mentioned that we need to address speeding, obviously, and there’s no one in this House that would say that we don’t and there’s no one who would say that speeding is a good thing, but he said, “Photo radar is not the answer.”", "My question, then, is, sure, I agree that we need to be do everything we can to ensure safer school zones, but if this is the primary focus, then why did we see in committee a failure to actually take real steps to improve this bill in ways that we would gladly support, and improve this bill with certain amendments that would ensure that there would be common sense restrictions that would close loopholes that would have led to an increased revenue tool? That is not the intention of this legislation, and I would hate if, by default, that is what occurred.", "We have to recognize that we have to work together to improve this legislation. To the member for the third party: I appreciate his concerns that he brought forward about perhaps the amendments that were brought forward by my caucus colleagues at the committee stage of the legislation. But I would urge the member from Niagara Falls to consider that the reality is that as opposition and in his role in the third party, our duty here in this place, and especially within committee, is to improve legislation, to work on building that legislation into a better piece of legislation that closes loopholes, that closes these issues. I know that with other pieces of legislation—I think of Bill 89, which is currently going through the Legislature and committee.

Maybe it should be named the “giving municipalities a new tax tool act.” I’m not saying that that’s what it is, but we have to be careful that that’s not what it turns out to be. The reality is that we’ve seen chronic underfunding from this government. We’ve seen chronic underfunding for municipalities. They’ve long been seeking mechanisms to provide new revenue due to ongoing government underfunding.", "Again, I’m not making this statement, but I am begging the question: Is this government simply using this as a creative justification to do just that, to provide an increased revenue tool, a “giving municipalities a new tax tool act”? Is that what they’re thinking behind the scenes? Perhaps that’s what they joke about when they’re not in this House.

We heard that. The member from Niagara Falls spoke about it at some length. Everyone here would recognize that a huge factor in a wide variety of accidents, including the blow-bys which the member for Chatham–Kent–Essex is seeking to diminish, occur from speed. But there are other realities that impact dangerous driving, whether that’s texting and driving, as we’ve spoken about in this House before when the member from Nipissing brought forward his private member’s bill, which would have allowed for the creation of texting zones, or whether it’s, again, perhaps intoxication. The reality is that there’s a wide variety of issues that impact safe driving that we need to examine and look at reducing.", "Again, I’m not saying that this isn’t necessarily a good step in the right direction, but we have to look at all these areas. If one of these issues is blow-bys, blowing past school buses, then why are they being so short-sighted in their perspective on school safety? If they only care about kids, perhaps, when they’re getting on and off of the bus—what about the importance of these school bus blow-bys, when they’re stopping, then?

People are speaking about moving from Burlington, Mississauga, Oakville and those areas into Niagara—many young families, as well as many retirees—and one of the concerns that did come up at the doors was the question of their children’s safety in many regards.", "I’m sure many members of this House who were involved in municipal politics know that everyone wants to have a speed bump in front of their home, because they are concerned about cars not slowing down in front of their home, and I must confess that I understand that concern from a parenting perspective—or as an uncle, I should say, I understand that. You obviously want to keep them safe.", "I think we have to look at some of the recommendations that are being brought forward in other areas of student safety as well, not just relegated to expanding these zones where we can throw up photo radar and increase revenue for municipalities. Again, Madam Speaker, I’m not making this statement about all municipalities doing this, but if it’s not what it’s about, if that’s not why the government is putting forward this legislation, then why won’t they close the loophole? Why won’t they make sure that it’s being put forward only in school zones, that it’s only applying to these areas that are high safety?", "It’s a shame that the Liberals turn an opportunity to really enhance school safety—they’ve turned it into more of a political wedge that forces, perhaps, photo radar back on expressways, parkways and highways. I think we have to just be careful and realize the precedent that this is setting, if this bill does pass in the Legislature.", "So, community safety zones: Let’s talk a little bit about this. What is a community safety zone? It’s a vaguely defined zone, and its associated fines can go virtually anywhere or for anyone within a municipality’s jurisdiction. According to the Highway Traffic Act, a community safety zone is any zone where “in the council’s opinion, public safety is of special concern on that part of the highway.”", "Councillor Sam Merulla—he’s from Hamilton—has read the legislation and understands it. He announced plans to seek community safety zone designation for the Red Hill and the Lincoln Alexander expressways. These are not school zones. These are not places where children are getting on and off buses. These are not places where people are attempting to cross the street, perhaps, or leaving school or coming into school. These are not school zones; these are expressways. Councillor Sam Merulla, if he’s trying to push for community safety zones in these areas, that’s missing the point of the legislation. But then, going back to what I’m saying, we have to address how we can close these loopholes.", "Having set that out, having laid out the fact that certain members in this House seem to have wanted to put forward this portrayal of the PC caucus as being somehow opposed to child safety, as being opposed to school safety, as if we were wishing that our children, our nephews and nieces and our neighbourhood children were being mown over by the hundreds, as if that’s exactly what we want—please note the sarcasm, Madam Speaker.

I think when you look at our history on that, that’s something that we’ve shown.

We need to make sure that this happens as soon as possible, that we have meaningful legislation in place that will deter people from speeding past children while they’re attempting simply to go home, after a long day often, or heading to school to learn.", "I agree wholeheartedly that no child should have to fear being struck by a speeding driver, by a distracted driver—", "Interjections." ],

They have an ideological focus that fails to recognize the importance of accepting good ideas from all sides of the aisle.

There are different kinds of tools and different technologies, and I’ve learned a lot about that through this.", "I think the majority of the voices from my community have said that we need it to be safer; we want it to be safer; we want to know that our children are safe in and around their school zones or in and around their community safety zones. That’s been a good part of this conversation: What on earth could a community safety zone be?", "I know and I’m sure that many people in—well, most of us in this room know that our municipalities do great work, but they do that connecting work.

For them to designate one as such, they’re going to have to prove that to their constituents.", "At council—I know in Oshawa we have a very active greater community that participates in and around those meetings. Any time our council is debating or discussing something, they have lots of active participation from the community. I hope, with this piece of legislation, that what happens in our communities is that the communities are involved in saying, “Hey, our schools need to be safer. This is where we want it.” But also, we have libraries, we have soccer fields, we’ve got a community centre where the kids are coming and going, folks are loading strollers or sports equipment in and out, and these areas need to be considered, not just in and around school zones.", "To my colleague’s point in response to some of the amendments brought forward about limiting the time that a school safety zone is only considered a school safety zone—or photo radar or speed cameras or whatever can only be used within this confined time goes against what we have been talking about all session. It’s the importance of community hubs. When we hear the different members talking about school closures and the importance of schools in our community, they’re the heart of our community; that heart doesn’t ever stop beating. That as a community hub—and as my colleague mentioned, child care.", "I also know from my time at school, when the bell rings and the kids leave, that’s sometimes when the party starts in terms of the after-school programming, the sports clubs, the teams and the different things. You’ve got all sorts of opportunities in and around the school, whether they’re language programs for newcomers—we use our schools in all sorts of ways.", "I would love to tell you a little bit about my time as a teacher. When I was teaching in the south end of Oshawa, we had a scare one day. It’s not a sad story, and I’m awfully glad to not have one, frankly. One of our kids stepped in front of a parked car. The cars were just parked along in front of the school. He stepped in front of a parked car to then gauge the traffic to be able to cross the street. The problem was, as he was gauging, the parked car was also gauging how to pull out into traffic and hit the kid—I didn’t mean to laugh; it was nerves, sorry. I was there. It was not funny. It was scary.", "The kid got knocked, rolled his ankle and got scared. We brought the ambulance there and he went for X-rays and all of that. But it happened so quickly, and that’s the thing. When we think about even driving through our own neighbourhoods or our school zones, if a kid is chasing a ball or tips off their bike or is talking and walking and texting, and all the other things that can happen, surprises happen and, unfortunately, not every surprise is a good surprise. That was something I remember, how quickly it happened, and I didn’t see that it was going to happen.", "Our kiss-and-rides in the morning: For anyone who is not sure what that is, in a school zone it’s where you drop off and pick up. You drive in and through and toss your kid and the lunch out the window and away you go; you kiss and you drive off.", "But in and around the school, as cars are turning in and slowing down, and “Oh, no, I forgot your lunch,” and they slow down and speed up—there’s all sorts of stuff that happens in the morning—there are a lot of people who just want to get to work and get around this. They are impatient. You see them slow down because they have to and then speed around and do stupid things—because they’re grumpy, they’re on their way to work and they’re making really, really unfortunate choices. That’s such a danger. Impatient driving—goodness knows, when we look around our community, we talk about distracted driving. But impatient driving and snarky driving and all of these things—we don’t need that in and around our kids, whether it’s in a school zone or a community safety zone.", "Another piece: The member from Nickel Belt mentioned this a while back when we were debating this, and I want to come back to it. She had talked about some of the roadways up north, that there might be one main thoroughfare or one main highway, and the school is on that. She had specific examples, and I’m afraid I don’t remember, but my takeaway was, you had kids and maybe their parents, some of them on bikes and some of them on foot, crossing the road and trying to gauge traffic. But when you imagine that this is a major roadway—and in parts of Ontario, you’ve got major roadways that schools are on. The member was talking about Avenue Road. While that may not be a northern road, it’s a busy one, with really major construction in places and unpredictable areas. So the major traffic up north—and not just the general flow of traffic, but major transport trucks and vehicles, whether they’re from part of the mining industry or otherwise. They don’t slow down easily. So to imagine kids having to sprint across or wait for a break in traffic—those are very dangerous games to play. I’m not suggesting that the kids are playing games; I’m suggesting that perhaps we need to look at these areas and give those municipalities and those communities the tools they need to define areas that need to be safer.", "The member from Niagara Falls talked about his time on city council—to allow municipalities to make decisions based on what they’re hearing in their community and to trust that they can make those decisions. I also trust that my community is going to hold my council to account, because we see it on a regular basis, and I hope that’s true everywhere. But I’ll take a moment and read—I have a letter here that was from our mayor to the region. I’ll read a part of it:", "“The city of Oshawa has been receiving a considerable amount of calls related to speeding in our local school zones. My assumption is this is problematic for all municipalities of Durham.", "“Our support from Durham Regional Police to resolve these issues has always been exceptional; and we as a municipality have done our best to post appropriate signage in school zone areas (zone warning, maximum speed, stop signs, crosswalk etc.), and worked with neighbourhoods to create a friendly environment.", "“The challenge that we have is an insufficient amount of staff, at either level of government to solve this problem. Therefore, I am respectfully asking that the board consider the installation of photo radar in school zones as an additional enforcement tool. This technology will allow our officers more time to utilize their expertise towards other policing issues, and provide safer access for children and pedestrians on roadways while travelling to school facilities.”", "If we’re hearing voices like that from across municipalities saying, “Give us the resources we’re asking for. We know what’s best. We’re hearing it from our communities”—I’m learning that there are different levels of government for a reason.", "Here is another letter from a constituent:", "“I spend a lot of time in Calgary, AB visiting our children and grandchildren. Calgary uses photo radar around schools, parks and at high-risk intersections. It works! Please support any legislation that would make it possible to use these valuable tools in Ontario.”", "Another one:", "“I live in a school zone in Oshawa, On., and have done so for about 40 years. Like many Ontarians, I believe the time has come to consider looking into the return of photo radar in Ontario, particularly in school zones. There are numerous obvious benefits in bringing back some form of photo radar for use in municipalities. I realize photo radar has not been overly popular in the past, however, public opinion is changing, and support of photo radar is growing rapidly. There appears to be widespread interest for the use of this technology in school zones.”", "That’s the bulk of what I’ve heard, and anyone else who has had concerns has said, “If we’re going to have an enforcement tool, if we’re going to have a speed reduction tool, I want to have the proof. I want to have the reassurance it’s going to make it safer.” So I think that’s going to fall to the municipalities, to work out with their constituents what it will look like. Is it going to be posted? I don’t know. There are so many different tools now, and I think that’s an important part of it, because the goal here is to make our communities safer, to keep our children and our pedestrians safer.", "I’ve still got a couple minutes, so I’m going to say a special thank you, because I have the opportunity. On Monday, May 1, it was School Crossing Guard Appreciation Day in Oshawa. We have been recognizing this day for the past eight years, and I want to take a moment. As I’m sure we can all appreciate, our crossing guards make such a difference, not just in the morning, or before and after school; they’re a special part of our community.", "Each year, the traffic is increasing. We know that. We talked about distracted driving and impatient driving. But their jobs are actually becoming far more dangerous. I remember when I was walking to school, and I remember our crossing guards. I remember being old enough to be allowed to walk all by myself to school, and that was a pretty big deal, but I was only allowed to do that because we had a crossing guard. Actually, that was in Winchester. It was a small town, and maybe with not a lot of traffic. I haven’t been back since I was this big, so maybe there’s more now.", "Crossing guards play a significant role in our communities. They’re literally part of our children’s journeys to and from learning, and they keep them safe. This is also a tool to keep them safe, as well, because they’re out on our roadways on a school-daily basis, and we also want to keep them as safe as possible.", "This is a piece of legislation that we’ve been talking about, and we’ve gotten to the point now that it’s on the horizon for our municipalities to actually use it as a tool to keep our children safer. I think we can all agree that that is a very important goal." ],

I’m truly honoured to speak further to our proposed new legislation, Bill 193, Rowan’s Law (Concussion Safety), 2017.", "First off, I would like to thank everyone who has provided support and input in developing this draft legislation. I’d like to thank Gordon and Kathleen Stringer, the parents of Rowan Stringer, in whose name this legislation has been introduced. I’d like to point out that Gord and Kathleen are here with us today. We just had breakfast downstairs. If you wouldn’t mind standing for us, Gordon and Kathleen.", "Speaker, before I continue, I should also mention to you that I’m going to be sharing my time with the member for Ottawa South.", "I also want to thank the members of our Rowan’s Law advisory panel for their important work on this initiative as we fulfill our government’s commitment to protect amateur competitive athletes by improving concussion safety on the field and at school.", "As members of the House know, it was on May 12, 2013, that 17-year-old Rowan Stringer died as a result of multiple concussions that she sustained while playing rugby with her high school team. Rowan was playing a game that she loved. Not only was she captain of her team, but she also played rugby during the summer break.", "A coroner’s inquest was convened in 2015 to look into the circumstances of her death. During eight days of testimony, several witnesses, including Rowan’s friends, coaches and her mother, testified on the events related to her death. The coroner’s jury made 49 recommendations on how government ministries, school boards and school organizations should improve the manner in which concussions are managed in this province. Since the coroner’s inquest, Ontario has already implemented several of the recommendations. I want to express our appreciation for the work of the coroner’s jury inquest and for the presentation of their findings.", "In the summer of 2016, following the jury’s recommendations, the Rowan’s Law Advisory Committee Act, 2016, was passed, establishing an expert committee to review the coroner’s recommendations and to make recommendations to the government. The Rowan’s Law Advisory Committee Act, 2016, was passed with all-party support. I’d like to thank MPP Fraser as well as MPP Fife and MPP MacLeod for their work in getting this act passed.", "The advisory committee, chaired by Dr. Dan Cass, who is here with us today—I’m going to ask that he stand and give us a wave; he was very instrumental in this—reviewed the coroner’s jury’s recommendations and developed a report, including 21 recommendations for government. We wanted recommendations that would lead to real change across the amateur sports sector and in schools, and provide momentum for changing the culture and to help build a foundation for world-class concussion prevention and management here in the province.", "One important element of this culture shift is to ensure that there is no fear or stigma attached to disclosing a concussion or any symptom of concussion. We have this attitude that if somebody gets hurt while they are playing a sport, you might hear from teammates or from your coach to “walk it off” or to “get back in the game.” This is what we need to look at: We need to have a culture change in this attitude.", "Every single one of the jury recommendations was addressed in the advisory committee report and laid the foundations for Bill 193 and for the amendments to the Education Act. The proposed legislation, Speaker, includes four mandatory elements, and I want to share them with you:", "—an annual review of concussion awareness resources that help prevent, identify and manage concussions, which athletes, including students, coaches, educators, and parents/guardians of athletes under the age of 18, would be required to review before registering in a sport. They’ll do this for free with an online tool;", "—removal-from-sport and return-to-sport protocols, to ensure that an athlete is immediately removed from sport if they are suspected of having sustained a concussion; and", "—an established concussion code of conduct that will set out rules of behaviour to minimize concussions while playing sports.", "In addition, the proposed legislation would proclaim an annual Rowan’s Law Day to raise awareness regarding the issue of concussions. This would be looked at every fall and help us to remind ourselves of what Rowan sustained and how we can all be part of ensuring better safety in sport in Ontario.", "Speaker, this legislation, if it’s passed, would affirm our groundbreaking role as a national leader in concussion prevention and management by establishing minimum standards in amateur competitive sport in elementary schools and high schools in Ontario.", "The proposed bill is supported by my ministry, as well as the Ministries of Education, Advanced Education and Skills Development, Children and Youth Services, Municipal Affairs, and Health and Long-Term Care. If this legislation is passed today, our government will continue our cross-ministry work to increase awareness, prevention, identification and concussion management in schools and in the broader community.", "Ontario is taking a lead role in Canada on moving forward with a harmonized provincial approach on this serious health issue, and we believe that our approach is one that should be followed right across the country.", "If passed, this legislation would be a catalyst for longer term culture change for concussion management and injury prevention in amateur sport and beyond. Through increasing awareness and changing conversations on the field of play, at school and in our homes, we can create a world-class amateur competitive sports system by empowering athletes and Ontario residents to participate safely.", "If passed, the proposed legislation will respond to the expectations of every Ontario family that their children and youth are protected by a safe sports system where everyone understands concussions, actively minimizes the risks and knows what to do immediately if someone is suspected of having been concussed.", "If passed, the proposed legislation would empower athletes to let someone know if they think they or their teammate might have sustained a concussion. When a parent signs up their daughter or son for a sport, Speaker, in school or outside of school, they want to know that all steps are being taken to ensure their child’s safety. They want to know that they are going to come home for dinner that night.", "When a child or teenager steps out onto a playing field, they should know that they will be supported if they are injured or have to be removed from a game. Coaches and officials should have all the information that they need to recognize the symptoms of a concussion and immediately remove an athlete from sport if a concussion is suspected.", "Rowan’s Law and related amendments to the Education Act would change the culture of amateur competitive sport in our province, because Ontarians need to know that athletes are protected by a safe amateur sports system where everyone understands concussions, actively minimizes the risks and knows what to do immediately if someone is suspected of having been concussed.", "We owe this to Rowan Stringer. We owe it to Rowan’s parents, Gordon and Kathleen, who over the past five years have been the strongest advocates for change in the way that we seek to prevent concussions and in helping to educate others on concussion safety. I thank them very much for their courage and their leadership throughout this process.", "We owe this to future generations so that people of all ages and abilities have the safe sports system that they want and deserve in the province of Ontario.", "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I know that there are many people who have done the heavy lifting on Rowan’s Law. It is my honour, as the new Minister of Tourism, Culture, and Sport, to step in for third reading. I’m looking forward to working to my colleagues as we get this through third and final reading, as we vote on this and as this bill advances into regulations and we sort out many of the details. Thank you all very much." ],

We were joined by the member from Kitchener–Waterloo. It was a partnership that led to meeting Rowan’s parents, Gordon and Kathleen Stringer, and hearing at first hand their story.", "Their daughter Rowan’s death was preventable. The Stringers have pushed through pain and anguish that most of us will never really know to ensure that young athletes are protected from concussions. They are very courageous and committed people. Although I never met their daughter, Rowan, I am sure she had the same courage and commitment. As my father used to say, the apple does not fall far from the tree.", "I know that they are with us in the gallery today. On behalf of my family, and indeed all Ontario families, we thank you for your courage in sharing Rowan’s story and advocating for what we needed to do to protect young athletes. We know that it has been a journey for you, and we’re all proud to have joined you on that journey. Without you, we would not be standing here today on the cusp of Rowan’s Law becoming law in Ontario.", "I want to say a few thanks. I will say a few thanks to the committee, but I also want to thank, right now—I was talking to Steve Harlow, who is your ADM in the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport. I want to say thank you to all the people inside government, Steve Harlow and all the team, who worked—we were talking about it this morning—at what I would describe as lightning speed in government-speak, in government terms, to move this bill forward. It has taken a lot of work, a lot of collaboration, and we’re very pleased that you made it a priority.", "The proposed Rowan’s Law (Concussion Safety), 2017, is important for the safety of every person participating in competitive amateur sport in Ontario. It is a priority to make the sports system safer for everyone. Ontario confirmed its commitment when we became the first jurisdiction in Canada to task a committee with making recommendations to government about the topic of concussions in amateur sport.", "I want to once again thank Dr. Cass and the members of the advisory committee, some of whom are here: Dr. Charles Tator and Susan Kitchen. I haven’t got everybody, so I shouldn’t have started in the first place. But thank you very much for all the work that you did. You worked at lightning speed as well; a big group of people that came together, which is a very special thing to see in and of itself but especially so for the subject matter that you handled. I’d like to thank you for your work and for recommending actions that have laid the groundwork for this important piece of legislation.", "I had the privilege of participating in public hearings on Rowan’s Law last week and was impressed by the commitment, dedication and knowledge of all the panel members who presented. From those hearings, the committee on social policy put forward one amendment, which was unanimously supported. That amendment was the annual public reporting on the progress of the advisory committee’s recommendations.", "Mr. Speaker, this is legislation that, if passed, will be a model for other jurisdictions in Canada and around the world for preventing and managing concussions. We have taken important steps to increase awareness about concussions. These include a government web portal developed by the Ministries of Health and Long-Term Care, Education and Tourism, Culture and Sport as a one-window entry point to resources on concussion prevention and management. The Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport’s recognition policy has added a requirement that all sports must have protocols inside their policies to be eligible.", "Implementing prevention strategies will help in decreasing the number of concussions that occur. Ultimately, understanding factors that increase the risk of concussion and implementing prevention strategies will help in decreasing the number of concussions that occur.", "If passed, this legislation would increase awareness about the importance of prevention, identification and concussion management in organized amateur competitive sport. It would promote the adoption of standardized concussion protocols in the organized amateur sport sector and position Ontario as a leader in Canada in concussion safety in amateur competitive sport.", "As we work to make it safer for children and youth in schools and amateur athletes to participate in sports, we rely on the broad support of our partners in the health care sector. Professionals working in the field of neurotrauma have long been partners in developing best practices, provincial standards and clinical guidelines as we work to prevent concussions in Ontario.", "If the legislation passes, which I’m confident it will, we will continue to work closely with the health care sector to examine the impacts of this legislation. We are committed to exploring ways to support our health care professionals further should reported cases of suspected concussions increase.", "If passed, Rowan’s Law would put into place strategies to raise awareness and reduce the risk of concussions for amateur athletes. It would also support concussion management when they do occur. It would give athletes and parents the peace of mind they deserve.", "The bill also includes the declaration of a Rowan’s Law Day on the last Wednesday of September every year. This will contribute greatly to awareness at a critical time: when students are returning to school. I would also respectfully suggest that the annual reporting be around that time of year as well to maximize public awareness.", "Our government is proud to help ensure the safety of every person in Ontario, and I call on all members to join us in that effort by supporting this bill today. I look forward to the vote this afternoon. Thank you. Merci." ],

It’s obviously always important to me when my constituents Gord and Kathleen join us in the assembly and I have an opportunity to not only speak about their daughter, Rowan—who I never met, but I feel I know—and their dedication and determination in not only fighting for a coroner’s inquest being part of that, and then being part of this legislative process.", "For far too long, I think, in the Legislature, sometimes we act after a tragedy. It takes great courage for, in particular, parents, but anyone to come forward in such tragic circumstances and really advocate for changes. I’ve often said that the biggest child advocates, those whom I respect, I think, the most are those who lose a child, yet, day in and day out, persist in trying to make change not because they can bring back their child, but to prevent something happening to another person’s child.", "I always view the Stringers as heroes in that regard because, each and every day, they show up at the Legislature, they show up at public speaking engagements or they show up at meetings so that my child or any other child in the province of Ontario will not fall to a preventable death. I am always humbled by both of them for their courage, their strength and their determination. I am proud, after the last several years, to consider them to be part of my own family. Our friendship is very deep. They always have a home here in the Legislature, but in particular, in my constituency, they are regarded as heroes.", "It is interesting, sometimes in life, that we are full circle. I remember I was the education critic when the first piece of concussion legislation was actually introduced. That was when I first became aware of a world-renowned physician who was doing landmark research here in Toronto for our province of Ontario, Dr. Charles Tator. He was here, I believe, that day. I remember Walter Gretzky sitting in the Speaker’s gallery, who was a friend of our permanent Speaker, Dave Levac. I remember that piece of legislation coming forward, and I, as the education critic, stood up. Laurel Broten was the education minister at the time. We were in a minority Parliament.", "I remember we were going to support the legislation. I remember thinking I didn’t know much about concussions. I knew we were going to support it, because some of colleagues have had concussions. I know my colleague from Leeds–Grenville, who is a big supporter of Rowan’s Law, at the time was talking about how he had sustained some concussions. We were going to support it. But I didn’t understand. I believe at that point in time, they were creating an advisory committee, if my memory serves correct. I just remember at that point in time thinking we’re starting on a path to take something seriously, but I didn’t know at that point in my life what a public health and safety concern it would be.", "But I will never forget that day it was tabled, because there was Walter Gretzky in the Speaker’s gallery, whose son became the greatest Canadian hockey player, or greatest world hockey player. But on that same day—check the history books—Sidney Crosby had just been cleared from a concussion. I remember how interesting that was.", "Now, life happens: We are in a minority Parliament at that particular point in time; the government falls. Actually, the government didn’t fall; we prorogued. We ended up with a new session. That bill died on the order paper. Sadly, months later, my constituent tragically died, while playing rugby, from second-impact syndrome.", "A lot of that is public. My constituents Gord and Kathleen went through hell. Kathleen had been travelling at the time and had to make her way back home. One of the things we don’t talk about as much when we’re talking about Rowan’s Law but I believe is necessary to mention is that Gordon and Kathleen made the courageous decision for Rowan to be an organ donor. I know that most members—we talk about organ donation a lot. I want to talk about it right now, Speaker, because what was incredible is, not only were Gordon and Kathleen courageous in the last number of years in promoting this, but they made a very courageous decision at that point in time. Someone in this country is alive because of Rowan.", "It’s not just because we’re talking about concussions, and parents now have a better—and there’s more literacy—to take their kid off the field when they are hurt, in particular with a brain injury, but it’s because of the courage of that organ donation. I think that we owe you a debt of gratitude for that. I don’t think we talk about it enough, the other courageous act that you did.", "Then it became time for a coroner’s inquest. Gordon and Kathleen—anybody would understand if they had said, “You know, this is too much for me. I don’t want to go through that process.” No one would have blamed you if you had just walked away. But I believe, and if memory serves me correctly, that Dr. Tator reached out to you and encouraged you that this might be part of a good process for you. They decided to take that up and go through the coroner’s inquest. A dear friend of mine, Kay Stanley, was part of that coroner’s inquest. They went through that process. We’re very proud of the work that they all did with the expert witness, Dr. Tator, and the justice there. That was when the 49 recommendations came forward from the inquest on how we can treat, prevent and research concussions.", "The interesting thing—and this is one of the things that we learned early on—is that there’s no easy, neat way to package up recommendations from a coroner’s inquest and then put them into practice. That was the interesting part that we had to grapple with, because after the Stringers went through that process and the coroner’s inquest went through the process—what’s next? A great report, a great set of recommendations, but what do you do? That’s when they joined me in my office one day.", "We were talking about this—I think it was last week—Gordon and I. It was an interesting time in my life. Gordon and Kathleen had come into my office, and my walls had all been stripped bare. I think, Kathleen, you and I had this conversation last week, too. I had been going through depression and anxiety. They had come into my office. I remember looking at them and thinking, “I have to help. I don’t know how I’m going to do it,” but they gave me a sense of drive. Since then, they have been back in my office. There are things on the walls again. They said, “What should we do?” I said, “Well, we’ve got three options. We can get a motion on the floor of the House, which I think I can pass, but there won’t be anything called Rowan’s Law. We can say that we call for a Rowan’s Law, but it won’t be enshrined, because a motion in the Legislature is non-binding. I can put forward a private member’s bill, but it’s very rare that they pass if it’s just by one member. The third option is something we might like, and that is to take this set of recommendations, these 49 recommendations, and figure out a way, with all-party support, through three private members—one from each party—that we can usher it through the Legislature.” I remember Gordon saying to me at the time, “Rowan liked to bring people together, so she would like the third option: all the parties working together.”", "That was in June. We set about to find some suitable co-sponsors. We were very lucky. John Fraser was the first: very willing to call my office as a local Ottawa member who had been touched by concussion before, who had been reading the local news and wanted to act. He was, and probably still is, the parliamentary secretary to health. That was advantageous to us.", "Then we called a friend of mine from the NDP, Catherine Fife, and asked her to co-sponsor, as a mother and a former president of the Ontario school boards’ association, which was also fitting, given that health care and education intersected. We knew at that point in time that we had the desire to move forward on these 49 recommendations, but then it became a problem, because not all 49 recommendations actually were part of our level of government. We didn’t have jurisdiction over all of them. Some of them we could deal with, with what is called a PPM, or some policy initiatives; others were directives that we could bring forward at the grassroots level; and some of it needed legislation.", "So that became our challenge with these 49 recommendations: How do we make a Rowan’s Law out of these recommendations when some aren’t necessarily related to our level of government and others don’t need to be required in law, but some do? That’s when we settled, as we negotiated, on making this an advisory committee with representation from multiple government agencies, so that it could trickle down into amateur sport and through our education system while supporting our health care system. That’s what we did.", "I remember, and I’ll never forget, the day we decided to launch a petition to support this in my constituency. We had several hundred people stand out in the rain for two hours in support of this; I’ll never forget it. They came from all different athletic backgrounds. I was most impressed that it wasn’t just the rugby community, but I would be remiss not to say thank you so much to the Barrhaven Scottish rugby and Rugby Canada. They are incredible and have been part of this from day one.", "It’s easy for a major sports organization to sort of bury their head in the sand. We have seen, with some professional leagues, that it is easier for them to bury their head in the sand. But if I could stand here today and tell you one organization that chose instead to be proactive and is a leader among leaders, it is Rugby Canada. They have been there since day one. If I could appeal to the NHL, to the NFL, to the CFL and to every pro sports league out there: If you actually care about player safety and player health, then give Rugby Canada a call. They have been on the forefront of this tragedy, but also the solution that is coming out of the tragedy.", "So we stood there, Speaker, in the pouring rain at what will now be, and has always been after that, referred to as Rowan’s Pitch. We had tremendous community support, because people cared about the Stringers and they cared about the story of Rowan. They saw Rowan as Barrhaven’s daughter.", "We struck up a grassroots committee, and we would meet in a little restaurant that has since closed around an old farm table. We cherished those meetings and we became a real family. And then we had our Queen’s Park family, of Catherine and John, and then we added to that family. I see Susan Kitchen is here today; they play a critical role, at coaches Canada.", "There’s not a person who is coaching in amateur sports today that doesn’t go through training—I know because every private member’s bill I’ve either passed or supported, I ended up having to take a course in, as a hockey trainer.", "They are doing critical work, because today it is up to the coach and the trainer and any adult on that bench to ensure that their players’ well-being is being respected and that that is paramount. The work that those folks have done—Holland Bloorview children’s hospital, CHEO, our physiotherapists—they have come onside, they were early adopters and they all supported us.", "We ended up with a wonderful journey, a lot of good feelings and a lot of conversations about how we can best talk about concussion and bring that to the level at our grassroots.", "We ended up passing that piece of legislation with all-party support. It was certainly one of the more joyous occasions in my political career—but it came from a tragedy. We were very fortunate in our community in Barrhaven.", "I should mention Via Rail was supportive of our first bill. We had a tragedy in Barrhaven with a bus and a train years ago, many members will recall, and they have done a lot of community development. In those early days, when we were first getting Rowan’s Law off the ground, they were always ready to help, to make sure that people from our community could get here to Queen’s Park. I would be remiss not to say thank you to them for their support and for some of the—I’ll be very frank—more enjoyable trips home that we’ve had on Via together.", "I recall one particular trip—I had my daughter, Victoria, up here, and she’s quite fond of Kathleen. Poor Kathleen, for the whole four and a half hours, had to entertain Victoria, who was just sticking to every single word that she said.", "Gord is going to be very angry with me on this one. Gord’s real name is Ralph. Victoria is the only person who is allowed to call him that. I made the mistake one day of saying it to him, and he gave me the stare. Do you know the stare that moms usually give kids? He gave me that. I said, “Okay. Victoria is the only one allowed to do that.”" ],

I encourage the minister to be part of this, because some of the most amazing stuff we’ve done hasn’t actually been from legislation or in the House; it’s been working with the Concussion Legacy Foundation and See the Line, which is at Western University, and it’s the symposiums. One of the most amazing things that we’ve been able to do—and I’m only a very small part of it but very proud to have been part of it—is actually to have young athletes and their coaches and their trainers sit there with professional athletes and coaches and hear about what a concussion has done to certain individuals and how it has either limited their career or changed their health.", "One of the wonderful things: I was able to participate two years ago in See the Line with Gordon and Kathleen at Western University. Eric Lindros is the honorary chair. He had invited us down. That’s where we got to meet Tim Fleiszer, who is with Concussion Legacy Foundation. They have a two-day symposium—they have been doing it for years—and we ended up being part of it. They had a thousand people who were coming out to hear about concussions. They were front-line health care workers, and they were also people involved directly, either on the field, on the court, on the pitch or on the ice. They were learning some high-level research, they were learning about treatment and they were learning about prevention. In all that entire basket, there’s a greater degree of what I like to call “awareness.” It was pretty incredible to be part of that.", "We wanted to do something very similar in the city of Ottawa. I’ve talked about this a little bit in the Legislature. Last summer we had a golf tournament and we raised a substantial amount of money so that we could have a Rowan’s Legacy Symposium at Algonquin College in Nepean. It was very well attended. What struck me most—and I think I said this before in the Legislature—is that when we were up sitting on this panel, Gord, Eric Lindros and myself, I looked around: It was a packed house. We had the person who got the game-winning touchdown in the Grey Cup, and then we had little ringette players and little hockey players in that same room. They were all there to learn about concussion. There were people there from all the different sports leagues in Nepean and, I think, from different parts of Ottawa. We had clinicians. We had researchers. We had a wonderful discussion about the impacts of concussion.", "I think it was a greater degree of awareness. I hope we continue that on. If I may, Speaker, I’d suggest to the minister that this would be a great thing for her ministry to adopt province-wide. It would be really good to continue to support an initiative at the grassroots level like that, with our school boards and our local hospitals.", "I admit readily that we are very fortunate inside the city of Ottawa, because we have a major teaching hospital, we’ve got two universities, two major community colleges and four very vibrant and very large school boards in addition to professional sports leagues, so it’s a bit easier for us, as it might be also for Toronto and for some other larger centres. But if you look at some of the smaller communities across Ontario, they could definitely benefit from something like that.", "That’s why I think it’s important for us to have a dedicated Rowan’s Law Day, particularly in the middle of September, because that’s when kids are going back to school and that is when our school sports programs are starting up, hockey is starting up and many of the fall and winter sports are just beginning. It gives us not only an opportunity to reflect about player safety and health but also a way to encourage the kids to be more preventative.", "One of the other initiatives that Gordon, Kathleen and I have been involved in with the Concussion Legacy Foundation is something called #TeamUpSpeakUp. That actually encourages the entire sports community to be part of player safety. It’s not only up to the coach or the trainer; it’s also up to the player and their teammates. We were very much a part of that. I think that it really is going to be up to us, in order to change the culture around brain injury or any kind of trauma to the head, to have that serious discussion. It is part of all of our roles to be part of that.", "I think that is going to be a very important piece of this legislation, when it passes after question period today, and I think it can be augmented by some real grassroots initiatives that take hold. I like to say that we can mandate the change in culture, but it’s going to be up to the people at the grassroots to embrace that, much like it was for us many years ago—certainly not me; I was just young at the time—in order to make sure we were all wearing seatbelts. It was met with resistance at the time, but we changed the culture so that now, when we get into our car, we know that we feel safer when we buckle our seatbelt.", "We know, for example, that the smoking bylaws and smoking legislation were met with resistance. But now, today, most of us wouldn’t dare go into a building where there was somebody smoking. It’s just not a thing that we would do. I remember, when I was first elected, we had a piece of legislation where you weren’t allowed to smoke in cars with children. That’s a no-brainer today, but sometimes it was met with resistance. Drinking and driving seemed to be okay in the 1970s and early 1980s; now it is forbidden.", "So with everything, we have to lead the way, but it is up to our communities and it is up to the people we represent to also be there with us and to drive that change and to make it taboo. Whenever I think about concussion legislation, brain injury and brain trauma, it really is—we have to lead here, but at the same time, we have to have leaders in our community who make sure that change and that cultural shift are happening.", "I often remember, when we first brought Eric Lindros here, he was the one saying that it has got to be a cultural shift so that it’s not okay to get your bell rung and then go back out on the ice. I also remember one of the things that he said at the first press conference when he was here. I thought about it this weekend, actually. Gordon and Kathleen were at the rink with me on Saturday when my daughter was playing. I was thinking about it, because Eric said at the time—and this is a Hockey Hall of Famer, one of the greatest hockey players ever to play. He said at the time that every game, to a 13-year-old girl who is playing ringette, is just as important to her as to an NHLer in the Stanley Cup. I had never thought about that, really. As somebody who played ringette my whole life and who plays hockey, I had never thought about it that way. And then, there we are this weekend: My daughter is in her championship game, and while we were driving to the Minto arena in Barrhaven, she’s like, “Mum, this is like the Stanley Cup of peewee hockey for girls.”" ],

Because that game, to them, in their day, in their mind, is the most important game in their life. They don’t see two days from now; they don’t see two years from now. To them, it’s the instant gratification of being there in that moment, and they don’t understand the consequences that a brain injury or brain trauma could bring to them the next day or two years down the road. That’s why this piece of legislation is important.", "One of the other things I like to remind people is that you cannot put a cast on your head and think that your concussion is going to go away. I’ve had casts on my hand. I have had knee braces. I have sprained my ankle multiple times playing soccer, and I can put a wrap on it. I can still sort of walk around. I might need some crutches, but I’m going to mend.", "Here is the thing with concussions: They might be mild, and in two weeks’ time you may have no symptoms and you may be fine. You can have a concussion that is mild or severe, and if you don’t take care of yourself, there could be severe consequences. You could end up with depression down the road, maybe CTE or perhaps Alzheimer’s. ALS is something they’re looking at. And then, as in this most tragic case, second-impact syndrome could lead to death. It could be fatal.", "Obviously, you don’t really want to scare an 11- or 12-year-old kid at the rink or at the pitch, but the reality has set in that this isn’t just something that we’re talking about and trying to spook people about. This is serious, so we have to have that conversation.", "One of the things that occurs to me, as somebody who’s on the bench—and look, there are a lot of parents around here. I know Lisa Thompson’s grandson got a gold medal a couple of weeks ago, so she’s all about the hockey. She’s there and she’s watching Declain play." ],

In some cases, I’ve had to take a kid out of play, and in some cases I thought, “Okay, you bumped your head, but I think you’re going to be okay.” We actually have to have that set of symptoms, more so than anything else.", "I’ve had a kid break their leg on the ice, and it’s not pleasant, but I’ve also had a kid who had a concussion. When we took her back out to do that tryout—because the doctor had cleared her, and she has to have at least one practice before going into play—I asked her to skate from one end of the ice to the other, and she was nearly about to vomit. So I said, “You can’t play on the weekend.” That’s when you get into the case where some parents are going to say, “I paid the 500 bucks.” Who cares? Honest to God, I think my daughter has probably already forgotten that she won a gold medal on Sunday. So I think we’re going to be okay if we miss a game or the tournament or the season ender, because what’s more important is your child’s health. That’s one of the things that has struck me in this entire debate, Speaker. It’s one of those things that we have to be very serious about.", "Just before I close, today is a special day for a young man in my constituency. He is the page captain today. His name is Aashaz Syed. I don’t know if he’s in the chamber right now. I talked about this coming full circle, with me as the education critic, Walter Gretzky in the stands, and then working here with Catherine and John and having my constituents here. To have this young man here today, who lives in Barrhaven and whose parents, but probably not him, because he’s only about 12 or 13—he probably didn’t hear about Rowan Stringer until he got to the Legislature. But his mom, who is in the gallery today, would have, because this story impacted our community. For him to be the page captain today, when this legislation will pass and become law, is, in my opinion, very historic for the people of Nepean–Carleton. It’s one that I’m very proud to be able to share on the floor of this assembly with not just one person, because he will be on the floor with me, from Nepean–Carleton. That, to me, is historic, because he will represent the next generation that we are trying to get to in our school system—not only in Barrhaven, in our public school system in our community, but across Ontario.", "We are also very fortunate to have so many pages here today who can take on this message, go back to their schools after the March break and talk about something that is real and important in their own communities. Sometimes the brilliance of this Legislature is that we talk about high-level policy, but each one of us has a role to play when we go back into our communities and become those leaders that we need to be on very important public policy issues but, in particular, very important public health issues.", "Today, we have that opportunity as MPPs, but I look to my future here as our pages—and certainly to Aashaz—and really encourage you all to go back and carry this message on to your classmates and teammates. I know we have a fellow Nepean Wildcats who’s also a page here today, and that’s where this full circle comes to be complete.", "It started with a young girl in Barrhaven who wanted to be a nurse. She loved to play ringette and rugby. Here we are, today, and we’re going to pass this law in her name, so that Rowan Stringer will forever be remembered for the athlete that she was, the compassionate young woman she was and the person who will save future lives.", "To you, Gordon and Kathleen, thank you for your determination, your compassion, and your belief in this process.", "To my colleagues who have been part of this journey, John Fraser and Catherine Fife, and the three ministers who have helped carry this, thank you all very much.

It doesn’t happen that often.", "Obviously for some of us, it’s a very emotional process. We’ve been invested in this journey for quite some time. We formed relationships and have new friendships that we didn’t have prior. This is as good as it gets, I think, with legislation and establishing legislation, especially that it has been through all parties, with all-party support.", "Today is day six of Brain Injury Awareness Month, and so it’s a very fitting month for us to pass this piece of legislation. I truly believe that because all parties were invested in the process, and every member who had been part of this journey has this emotional connection and this commitment to seeing this legislation be successful, it will truly honour the life of Rowan Stringer.", "There are a lot of people who need to be thanked. Many of those people showed up to appear before the committee as delegations because they’re invested in the process of ensuring that the coroner’s inquest recommendations and now the recommendations from the Rowan’s Law Advisory Committee will be actionable. That was the whole goal, as stated by the member from Nepean–Carleton and echoed by the member from Ottawa South.", "We had the shortest clause-by-clause meeting we’ve ever had in the history of this Legislature, I’m fairly certain, with only one amendment to the legislation, which received all-party support. I think that’s a testament to the work of the committee. To that end, I want to acknowledge the Rowan’s Law Advisory Committee, which was headed up by Dr. Dan Cass, who has already been introduced; the director of education from the District School Board of Niagara, Warren Hoshizaki; Paul Hunter; Susan Kitchen; Louise Logan; of course, Gordon Stringer, who played a major role and is thanked by the committee extensively in this document; Kent Bassett-Spiers, who is the CEO of the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation; Elisabeth White, whom I had the pleasure of meeting at the breakfast that the minister hosted this morning. We have something in common: Both of our sons, at the age of 11, suffered their first concussion. I think that that’s one of the important parts, that it is the stories that we share that will inform the public awareness piece.", "I was going back and thinking about all of the concussion advocacy that has happened for a number of years. I come to the issue of concussion strategy management through the education system. A long time ago, I was working with Keith Primeau and Kerry Goulet. There is an inspirational quote in the book that they published, which is called Concussed! One of the quotes reads, “Our Inspiration.” It reads:", "“We believe that educating the public of the dangers of concussions will not come from lectures or public service announcements alone; rather, the stories of those affected by concussions will be the best ambassadors to raise awareness of this issue.”", "For me, it has been a full-circle journey to come back to be able to share Rowan’s story and employ that new knowledge, transfer that knowledge in a very actionable way.", "When I was speaking with Elisabeth, who is a nurse practitioner at neurosurgical outreach at SickKids—the culture of sports and the physicality of those sports are the reality that we’re dealing with right now. It certainly changed the trajectory of my son’s very short-lived hockey career. But it’s that knowledge that needs to be passed forward and transferred into action, as I have said.", "Of course, Dr. Charles Tator, who sat on the committee; Chris Markham, who is the executive director and CEO of Ophea—and Ophea came to the committee as well; Eric Lindros, who did appear before the committee—and I asked Eric at the committee level because there’s this concern that, if you go too far with concussion management and prevention, you will change the nature of sports. This theory—this myth really—has been employed to tamp down some safety measures that should be employed, I think, in the CFL and NHL. He countered that. To his credit, he said that the nature of sport is the athleticism; it shouldn’t be the violence in the sport. This is coming from someone whose career has ultimately been changed. As he said to the committee, it was concussions that ended his career. So I’ll touch back on the value of athletes who have had the courage to come forward in a moment.", "The other committee members are Dr. Rosana Salvaterra—she also appeared before the committee; Jennifer Knox of the Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations; Rosie MacLennan, the Olympic gold medalist from Team Canada. There were also acknowledgments to Duane Jacobs, who was a special adviser on First Nations issues—I think that it was very important to have that voice and that knowledge on the committee—as well as Colin Gray.", "Now, the athletes who have had the courage to come forward and talk about their journey: They really do need to be thanked because, as I mentioned, I think that that’s the culture shift that the advisory committee is working toward. We have, in Kitchener–Waterloo, Ben Fanelli, who played with the Kitchener Rangers. His concussion story is very dramatic. But he has transferred that knowledge into the HEAD STRONG program and is promoting brain injury awareness.", "When our private member’s bill first came to the Legislature, I had Fitz “the Whip,” a boxer who came to Queen’s Park and told his story. He has been involved in inspiring youth and also raising awareness around brain wellness. Ironically, he was so inspired by his trip here to Queen’s Park that he’s going to be running in Kitchener–South Hespeler as a candidate. You never know where these journeys are going to take you as you move through this place.", "Keith Primeau and Kerry Goulet, who worked with Stan Kutcher of Dalhousie University back in 2012 to really raise awareness for the You Are Not Alone program, were inspirational to me.", "Keith Primeau—of course, an NHL player, well known for the concussions that he suffered—was the first athlete I met who talked openly about the impact of concussion and brain injury on mental health. It’s an important connecting piece; it came up during committee.", "I think it’s important that the committee will come back and there will be an annual review because I don’t think that we fully explored the impact of concussions and brain injuries on mental health. That may be the next level that we take the advocacy to.", "Andrew Lue, who came to the committee—I mentioned him at breakfast. This is a football player who is an advocate for concussion prevention and awareness. He suffered a concussion, and he told the committee that he was injured in the middle of the game—this is someone who is completely informed—and he couldn’t take himself out because he had a brain injury. This is the importance of the culture shift and the shared responsibility and where we need to take concussion management. It was his coach and a fellow player who recognized he had been injured and he needed to leave the field. That was one of the more powerful delegations that I saw at committee.", "Now, in the education system we’ve had a policy program memorandum in place for almost six years. The PPMs are effective when they are applied. I think Rowan’s Law is going to raise the bar on the awareness of the shared responsibility of everyone who has contact with athletes or students who suffer from concussions.", "The first phone call that I received as a trustee back in 2010 was from a parent who said the school was not treating her daughter’s concussion as a serious issue and was not willing to make the accommodations to ensure that she could rest and still receive some homework but not to a strenuous level. That culture shift needs to come up from the bottom and it needs to come up from the top. I see Rowan’s Law as really the catch-all for both of those venues: the education system and community sports.", "I’m a big fan of evidence-based research in forming policy and legislation. I think that the advisory committee has done a true public service for this province in establishing the guidelines around returning to learn and returning to play, and then navigating the medical system.", "There are some things that we haven’t fully explored with this and that will be the financial commitments that will need to be made to ensure that the recommendations can be implemented with some integrity. There are some questions of people having access to medical resources; there are some equity issues that we see across the province.", "I’m happy that the amendment was brought forward that we review this on an annual basis, because there will be gaps. I think if we are truly all committed to ensuring that concussion management is really on the cutting edge and the leading edge in the province of Ontario so that we can shift the culture in the country, then we’re going to have to make sure that the goals and the intentions, which are very positive, actually can be met. I, for one, am obviously committed to that, but I really do believe that the ministry and—I had the opportunity to meet with the assistant deputy minister in getting a review of the legislation, which I was very thankful for.", "I do believe we have momentum but I feel better that we’re going to review the legislation and the implementation of that legislation on an annual basis.", "My final words are just a sincere thank you to the Stringers.

We listened to their concerns but also their hopes for a better life within today’s workforce.", "The Ontario economy is booming. The unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in well over a decade, exports and business investments are increasing, and we’re leading the G7 in economic growth. But the fact is that not everybody is seeing those benefits. The truth is that, in this growing economy, the growing prosperity that we are seeing is not affecting everybody equally. Some are being left behind.", "We’re not alone in this, Speaker. If you look around the world, if you look around the continent, you will see that this is happening in other jurisdictions. It’s happening in places that include our neighbours to the south, for example. You see that vulnerable and precarious work has become more prevalent.", "I’ve met with people who are no longer able to count on that full-time, secure job or stable work to provide for themselves or for their family. I’ve met moms and dads who are trying to raise a family on minimum wage. These hard-working Ontarians tell me that they’re anxious. They’re anxious about their jobs. They’re feeling nervous about their future and about their children’s future.", "It’s at times like this, in times of uncertainty for some people, that government has a responsibility to protect those people. We have a responsibility to be a positive force for change. Fairness and decency must continue to be the defining values of our workplaces. That’s why we introduced Bill 148, the Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act, and it’s why we will continue to fight for working families in this province.", "On January 1, we raised the general minimum wage to $14 an hour. It’s going up to $15 an hour the following year. After that, it will once again be tied to the rate of inflation, to the CPI, to give business the predictability that they’ve told us they need.", "The reality facing us today is that almost one out of every 10 workers in this province was earning the general minimum wage in 2016. In that same time frame, three out of 10 workers earned less than $15 an hour. That’s 30%. It includes the mother who has to work an overnight shift or has to work on call to support her two children. She has to pay for food, she has to pay for rent, she has to pay for daycare, for child care, and there is nothing left over. It also includes the restaurant worker who would like to go back to school, for example, but is now working two jobs just to put a roof over her head. It also includes those workers who work at the minimum wage but still have to use food banks and still have to use grocery vouchers so that they can put food on their table.", "Speaker, the higher minimum wage is helping people like them. It gives them a real chance to get ahead in this life. By raising the minimum wage, the government is putting more money into the pockets of people who spend it very, very quickly. When you’re earning at the lower income levels, like a lot of folks who this would impact, you make those expenditures very quickly. You pay your food; you pay your rent; you go see the landlord; you’re at the Shoppers Drug Mart; you’re at the Sobeys; you’re buying diapers—you’re buying the basics that allow you to support your family.", "By raising the floor, we’re supporting working people so that they can thrive and they can contribute. We know that increases to the minimum wage in the economy are good. They’re good for the economy and they’re good for all workers. Studies written over the past number of years, including work done by the OECD, the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, lay out the long-term benefits of higher wages for low-income workers. They also lay out the economic benefits that come when you alleviate that problem.", "Recent analysis of wage levels in the province of Ontario shows that low wages are bad for the economy. This was outlined in a letter that was published by 53 economists who support a $15 minimum wage. That letter read, “There are good economic reasons to raise the incomes of low-wage workers. Aggregate demand needs a boost. While Canada escaped the harshest impacts of the 2007-08 financial crisis, our country has also seen a slowdown in growth. We risk further stagnation without reinvigorated economic motors. As those with lower incomes spend more of what they earn than do those with higher incomes, raising the minimum wage could play a role in economic revival, improving macroeconomic conditions.”", "Aside from experts, the increase to the minimum wage obviously is popular with working people across this province. The people of Ontario agree that low-wage earners needed a boost. They agree that everybody in Ontario deserves to make a decent wage. And they agree that a $15-an-hour minimum wage is the right thing to do.", "It’s only one part of our government’s progressive plan to create more fairness in our workplaces. Personal emergency leave is being expanded to 10 days, including two paid days. Minimum vacation entitlement in the province will be increased to the Canadian average, three weeks a year, from two after five years. We are giving people affected by domestic and sexual violence 17 weeks of job-protected leave, including five paid days. At the beginning of April of this year, part-time workers who are doing the same job as full-time workers will be entitled to the same hourly wage.", "Many businesses in Ontario already know that paying your employees well, treating them fairly, treating them with respect and with dignity is good for their business. I see groups like the Better Way Alliance and the Ontario Living Wage Network. They’ve been sharing the stories of their members with us since Bill 148 was tabled last June.", "I personally have had the opportunity to visit a number of those businesses. I’ve travelled around the province. I’ve seen people who are already paying their workers above $15 an hour. They’re very profitable businesses, Speaker; they’re productive businesses.", "There are some employers that seemed to abandon the spirit of the legislation soon after it took effect on January 1. We’ve all seen and heard the stories in the media over the past couple of months. They’ve been disappointing, to say the least, but quite frankly, I think, they’ve made the Premier, myself, other members of this House and people around the province of Ontario very angry, that somebody would treat their employees that way.", "Working people in Ontario deserve much better than that. Governments are responsible for legislating workplaces in a free market economy to ensure that fairness prevails and decency continues to be the defining value. The vast majority of businesses in this province live up to their duties and their responsibilities as well.", "Unfortunately, some do not. A small minority of businesses think the rules are for somebody else. They do not represent the vast majority of business in this province, but simply put, this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated by our government.", "Our plan is to increase enforcement. We have been asked to increase enforcement. We’re hiring more employment standards officers to make sure that workers’ rights are protected. It will also level the playing field, so businesses—those good, smart, decent businesses that follow the rules—are not put at a competitive disadvantage to those that think the rules apply to somebody else.", "We have the ability to do this—to raise the minimum wage, to support families and build opportunity for people—because we balanced the budget. It’s allowing us to do a host of other things as part of our plan to build a better and a fairer Ontario, things like free tuition, expanded child care, free prescription drugs for anybody under 25, a basic income pilot, our fair hydro plan and the women’s economic empowerment strategy that the Premier announced just this morning.", "Creating fair workplaces and better jobs is a critical part of our work to build an Ontario where greater opportunity and greater security is available for everybody in this province.", "Not everybody is standing up for workers alongside us, and that’s regrettable. It’s unfortunate the Progressive Conservatives decided they would vote against Bill 148. They would rather we not raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. They don’t believe that workers should get paid sick days. They don’t believe in providing leave for victims of domestic and sexual violence.", "Let me be clear that the approach of the members on the other side of the House means some very certain things. It means that more people will continue to live in poverty. More of our neighbours will struggle to put food on the table and shoes on the feet of their kids. It’s going to stagnate the economy for years to come, and it’s the wrong way to go.", "Raising the minimum wage was necessary to create greater equality, and economic equality is necessary for a strong economy. The men and the women who received a raise on January 1 are spending that raise right in the communities, right in the BIAs, right on the main streets and right in the chamber areas of the communities in which they live. They’re buying groceries. They’re buying clothes for their kids.", "By creating more customers, we are creating more opportunities. By creating more equitable workplaces, we’re making Ontario an even more attractive place to live, work and do business.", "The alternative—the cost of doing nothing—is simply too high: too high for the working people of this province and too high for the economy. Changes like a higher minimum wage are truly historic, and they’re needed. Bill 148 was a landmark piece of legislation. It’s going to give unprecedented protection to millions of workers who didn’t have that protection before.", "There’s a motion before the House right now concerning support for the $15 minimum wage. I hope that some people in this House change their minds and I hope we’re able to unanimously tell Ontarians that we’re all fighting for them. I hope we can all affirm our support for a $15 minimum wage. But, given debate thus far and threats being made across the floor to roll back the minimum wage, that simply does not look very likely.", "Decent work and a good job should be the right of every hard-working Ontarian. Our government is going to continue to fight for these values. In a changing world where work is not the same as it used to be, we need to create a fair and better balance. A $15 minimum wage, as part of the Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act, will do just that: for workers, for employers and for Ontario." ],

Ontario residents are anxious about the threat of climate change. They’re concerned about the impact on our economy and the impact on their lives.", "We’ve all seen the horrific devastation from out-of-control wildfires in California and the fury of record-setting hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Images of beleaguered refugees and the destruction wrought by the fires around and in Fort McMurray a couple of years ago are still fresh in our minds.", "Here in Ontario, we’re seeing an increase in flooding, more intense storms, shorter winter road seasons, the proliferation of devastating invasive species and an increase in certain vector-borne diseases. I’m not alone in believing that climate change is the greatest threat to our security and prosperity.", "Ontario residents are looking to their elected officials and business leaders to confront the challenge and seize the opportunities. I am optimistic because the road we’ve travelled is hard and we will have to make changes, but our journey so far is bringing me some hope.", "Last week, Speaker, the iconic twin smokestacks from the Nanticoke coal-fired electricity plant were demolished. I don’t know if you caught the video. The stacks came tumbling down. It was quite an incredible sight. The action is a powerful and symbolic image of ending coal-fired electricity in Ontario.", "Closing down coal-fired generating plants was one of the largest-ever greenhouse gas reduction initiatives in North America. It was the equivalent of taking seven million vehicles off our roads. At the same time, it has really helped to clean our air. In 2005, there were 53 smog days in Ontario; in 2017, there were none—zero.", "Today we can say that Ontario’s electricity system is more than 96% free of greenhouse gas pollution. Thanks to these actions, Ontario is recognized internationally as a leader in the fight against climate change. I know this because, when I travel outside of Ontario, people ask me how we did it. It’s a huge difference, and no one will benefit more than our children and grandchildren. Now kids can play outside without their health being threatened by that orange haze I once saw—and we all saw—hanging over much of southern Ontario.", "Building on the coal ban, we introduced our cap-and-invest plan in 2016. Speaker, we’re capping the amount of greenhouse gas pollution that businesses can emit and investing the proceeds from our carbon markets into projects that reduce pollution and help make life easier for Ontario residents.", "Just what is cap-and-trade? With our carbon market, if a larger emitter exceeds their cap on pollution, they have to buy allowances in an open market either at auction or from other companies that have come in under their cap. I know that cap-and-trade or cap-and-invest is not an easy concept to explain. It doesn’t lend itself to a five-second TV sound bite, but we chose this plan because it guarantees reductions every year as the cap on pollution decreases, and because it delivers significant reductions at the lowest cost to Ontario families and businesses.", "We’ve held five carbon market auctions to date, generating about $2.3 billion in proceeds. Last week, we held our first linked carbon market with Quebec and California, joining a best-in-class carbon market, according to the independent Environmental Commissioner of Ontario.", "Let me remind you: We are required by law to invest every penny of the proceeds from our carbon market revenues into green projects that help us reduce greenhouse gas pollution even further. With the climate change action plan’s 90-plus measures, we’re investing in Ontario and reducing our dependency on imported fossil fuels. I’ll tell you, Speaker, between 2014 and 2016, Ontario purchased about $58 billion worth of fossil fuels from outside Ontario. We have a real plan to fight climate change and to reduce our imported fossil fuels dependency.", "Let me spend a minute, because I only have a little more than a minute, to talk about carbon market investments. So far, we’ve announced more than $1.5 billion worth of investments that reduce greenhouse gas pollution and other nasty air contaminants, while at the same time these investments are improving social housing, improving our schools, making bike lanes more common, supporting indigenous communities; they’re improving patient care, modernizing our industry, piloting innovative, clean technologies, partnering with municipalities and helping residents improve their homes.", "I spoke earlier about the importance of not just fighting climate change, but of also seizing the opportunities. Ontario is now home to 3,000 clean-tech companies employing some 65,000 people and generating about $8 billion in annual revenues. Not long ago, this sector was considered a niche industry, but that’s no longer the case. It employs 65,000 people. Today, our companies are exporting $1 billion worth of made-in-Ontario solutions every year. Our cap-and-invest program is spurring the development of new, clean technologies, bringing Ontario jobs and economic benefits in the growing market for climate-friendly products.", "I’ll simply say that Ontario residents are well aware of climate change. They are anxious about climate change in an era of increasing global competition. When we hear about NAFTA discussions and trade disputes, we really need leadership to step up and fight climate change. I am concerned, as many of us are concerned, that I don’t see any PC candidates who are steeping forward and talking about climate change." ],

Today, the government has ministerial statements on climate change and labour law which, not coincidentally, are also the subjects of two government resolutions that we’ve been debating for the past couple of weeks, and which are still on the order paper. The government House leader has tabled these motions and initiated debate on them as time fillers, quite simply because the government has exhausted itself. They have run out of ideas for a legislative agenda. In short, when it comes to any new legislation, they are basically done.", "At any time during the debate on the climate change motion that I mentioned, the government could have put up a speaker to say what the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change just said now. So why do we have these statements today by the ministry?", "It’s no secret that our party is in the midst of a leadership campaign. Our new leader is scheduled to be announced on March 10. Over the past few weeks, our leadership candidates have been engaged in a vigorous debate on all the issues concerning Ontarians. When our new leader is elected, we will move forward to review all of the issues and offer our solutions for the consideration of the people of Ontario leading up to the June 7 election.", "We look forward to March 10, May 9 and June 7 with excitement, and anticipation that the people of Ontario want a change of government. We seek the trust of the people of Ontario, and we ask them to join us to restore trust in the Premier’s office and confidence in Ontario’s future, to bring ability, integrity, competence, experience, sincerity, dedication and compassion back to the government of Ontario.", "Of course our caucus acknowledges that climate change is a fact. I’ve repeated this statement many times in this House going back a dozen years. I say again: 12 years. Of course we acknowledge that the vast majority of climate scientists say the earth is warming and that human activity and our greenhouse gas emissions are significant contributing factors to climate change. Of course we acknowledge that even though Ontario represents a very small fraction of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, we must do our part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of the worldwide effort to combat climate change.", "But this is where we diverge with the government. Unlike the current government, we also know that whatever we do to combat climate change, we need to ensure that Ontario’s families are not hurt and that our businesses remain competitive in a dynamic global economy. We need to protect jobs even as we reduce emissions.", "We know that the federal government is attempting to force carbon pricing on all provinces in Canada, but some provinces are questioning whether or not the government of Canada has the constitutional jurisdiction to force carbon pricing across the country. It appears that in the coming months, all of the provinces will have to respond.", "It’s no secret that within our party, there is strong opposition to a carbon tax. Why is that? Under the current government, taxes, fees, hidden taxes, more fees, hydro bills, auto insurance rates and the cost of living generally have skyrocketed because of mismanagement, scandal and non-existent oversight of expenditure. This is why family budgets are stretched to the limit and why people can’t afford another new tax.", "While we have made great progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we need to continue to find new ways to reduce emissions. We can do this through technology and innovation, and through the co-operation of our people. Let us challenge our finest minds in science and engineering, in our universities and colleges, in the private and public and non-profit sectors, to bring this issue to the forefront, and through technological advancement, find the solutions that will help us to combat climate change.", "Together we can meet this challenge and all of the other challenges as well, as we reach out to the promise of the future." ],

The Liberal government would have supported these amendments had they listened. Stakeholders, labour groups and progressive advocates called for all of those things in Bill 148.

Thousands of women have not achieved it.", "The minister’s own review, the Changing Workplaces Review, warned of the dangers of precarious work in small workplaces, and yet this new legislation tabled today is only going to apply to workplaces that have 500 or more workers, which is not the majority of workers in this province.", "Those are my comments today.

He was right about the consequences of failure: a bitter future for ourselves, for our children and for generations to come. If we don’t take effective action, it won’t matter how beautiful or exciting or wonderful the program sounds; the damage will happen.", "Yes, coal-generated power is over. It was a useful thing to do. But you can’t stop there. You have to continue at that level of reduction of emissions year after year after year if you’re actually going to protect the climate and this society.", "We are at a point when the stability of our society is at risk, and yet the actions taken by the Liberals will do little to avoid that risk.

This was a common theme at almost every pre-budget hearing in January. Speaker, I personally attended those and heard these attempted-suicide stories first-hand from the people themselves. It was so moving. What was so hurtful that day was that we heard individually from them that this government is not doing enough for mental health.", "The words of a 17-year-old student in Sudbury who decided to share his story left a lasting impression on everyone in attendance, myself included. He said, “I attempted suicide. I’m extremely fortunate to be here today. I felt utterly alone.” He went on to explain that most youth are unsure of what to do and where to go when they need help. Too often, they don’t know the resources available to them, and sometimes they can’t access these resources.", "Another presenter told us how his battle with depression led him to try to take his own life.

They will be assessed, and if they are high enough on the priority list, they will be put on an 18-month wait-list. If they’re not that high on the priority list, there’s a good chance they will go without care.", "What happens during those 18 months, Speaker? Well, the first thing that happens is, the parents are at wits’ end. They have a child who is sick. They try bringing them—him or her—to emerg. Emerg will keep them for a day or two. Most of the time they send them back to the community and say, “He or she will get the care they need in the community.” But all they get is a number on a wait-list that is not measured in days or weeks and months; we measure them in years, and then conflict starts within the family because they don’t know how to care for somebody who has a mental illness. They start to fight between themselves. Often the family will break up during those 18 months. The child will start to get bullied at school. Chances are, he doesn’t want to go to school anymore because not only does he have a mental health problem that he needs care for, but now he doesn’t have friends anymore, or she doesn’t have friends anymore.", "All of this could be avoided if only they gain access, but we’re not going to be able to fix this without fixing a system that doesn’t exist, making sure that we support the agencies with base budget increases, that we support the agencies to make sure they have enough resources to meet the needs of the ever-growing—I’m really proud of Ontarians who have finally turned the page and are reaching out for mental illness and mental health care. I never thought I would see the day that a 60-year-old man—no offence—would come out and say, “I need mental health care.” But we are there, and I’m proud of them. But then what happens? They are put on a wait-list, and this wait-list never gives them the care they need. It’s all for none. We have to do better. We cannot let this go any longer. And $1.7 billion over 10 years is probably not enough, Speaker—probably not enough.", "As I said, I’m happy we’re talking about it.

So I would encourage members in this Legislature to take a look at the results from that step program. I think it’s something that we have to look at for Ontario. I think there are great possibilities. That’s all because the people in the youth addictions world in the Champlain LHIN decided they were going to work together, and when they decided to work together, with the help of the resources from the provincial government, the city government and the school boards, they were able to come up with this program.", "We’ve done the same thing around suicide prevention. Through the Youth Services Bureau, with the Royal and Ottawa CHEO and United Way and the province of Ontario, about seven years ago we started a suicide prevention program that has blossomed out. It is still being funded by those partners, but there is additional funding that’s coming to it and it has helped a lot with navigation, peer support and ensuring that in places like schools there are resources for people to go to.

They remind us that mental illness is just that, an illness—an illness that deserves to be treated in the same way that we treat any other illness.", "Make no mistake, it does take courage to speak out. The stigma associated with mental illness is still a barrier—a barrier that we have started to knock down, but it’s still there. For example, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health reports that 39% of Ontario workers say they will still not tell their managers if they are experiencing a mental health problem. Speaker, it’s hard to imagine that there’s a family out there who hasn’t been affected in some way by mental illness.", "Today’s motion makes mention of the fact that in any given year, one in five people will experience a mental health or addiction problem. In addition to that, CAMH also says that by the time Canadians reach the age of 40, one in two will have or have had a mental illness. This prevalence of mental illness might be the reason that so many more people understand that mental illness deserves to be treated in the same way that we treat physical illness.", "In our minds, we have crossed that bridge, but not when it comes to the delivery of mental health services. Two weeks ago, the former Minister of Health, presumably speaking on behalf of the government, said this in the Legislature: “I think all of us understand that mental health and physical health are two sides of the same coin,” as my colleague had also said. He continued to say, “We need to demonstrate that same vigour, intent and determination on mental health as we do in providing health services for those with physical ailments.” That’s what he said.", "Yet when the Wynne Liberals were asked to act, when the all-party Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions provided recommendations, they ignored them. According to the data, just a few years ago Ontario spent $1,361 per capita on health care versus $16.45 on mental health. That’s shameful, Speaker, and it has to tell us something.", "Speaker, my motion from last week focused specifically on mental health for children and youth. It’s an area of particular interest for me. It’s also crucial—many of us know and understand that here in this Legislature—because if it’s not treated early, the problems not only continue but magnify as time goes by.", "We know that 70% of mental health conditions in adults start in childhood and adolescence. The lack of treatment for children and youth with mental illness has a significant ramification for those people as they reach adulthood.", "I want to take a little bit more time to talk, again, about children and youth specifically. According to CMHO, Children’s Mental Health Ontario, there are 12,000 children and youth waiting for community-based mental health services in the province. Some are waiting for up to 18 months. We have about 6,500 who are waiting at least a year. This is completely unacceptable. This government is failing Ontario’s children and youth suffering from a mental illness. They are getting sicker, they are suffering, and in too many—way too many—cases, they are dying.", "That is the result of chronic underfunding on the part of the Wynne Liberals. A government that has only provided two increases to the base funding of community-based mental health centres in the past 25 years: If you do the math, they’ve been there 15, so they were there before that and no base funding from them either—“them” would be the Conservatives, Speaker. In 2003, 3%; in 2006, 5%, and that’s it. Inflation over that same period has increased costs by over 55%. Demand has increased by 10% annually for the past number of years. The lack of services that are available and the lack of funding that has been provided have created major problems because with funding, inflation and demand, it means service providers are operating at about half the capacity that they were previously.", "The government talks about the work they have done on Moving on Mental Health. I’m not going to criticize the thought behind that strategy, but I will criticize the results we have seen thus far and I will criticize the Wynne government’s abject failure to get the results children and youth desperately need. They said we would see a program within three years that would deliver early and appropriate help for each child and youth who needs it. That was six years ago, and we’re still waiting.", "When I talk to providers in Hamilton, since we’ve moved on Moving on Mental Health, we’ve closed 24 beds, just recently. That’s because of this Moving on Mental Health that we’ve had to close beds, because of the lack of funding that this government has provided.", "I took part in the Standing Committee on Public Accounts when it met last year to consider the Auditor General’s report on children and youth mental health. Diane Walker from the Children’s Centre Thunder Bay told us this:", "“I really agree, in part, with the ministry that Moving on Mental Health has the real potential to change things. I really want to work collaboratively ... I believe in it and I love doing it and I love creating systems that work for kids.", "“Here’s the truth: I’m going broke. I’m not trying to be dramatic. I’m not trying to be difficult. I’m not trying to throw the ministry under the bus. My agency is closing programs because, although there have been investments in children’s mental health—and they’ve been important ones—they aren’t investments in the core, core services we deliver.”", "I think that says it all. I know other speakers want to have some time on the clock. I thank you for the opportunity. We really do need to get down to business and ensure that kids and people in this province get the mental health services they need, and get it now." ],

I spoke to this last week, and I’m happy to speak to this again.", "I think it would be fair to say that, on all sides—not just government, but society as a whole—we’ve done a fairly good job of destigmatizing mental health issues. Because we have been reasonably successful—there’s still stigma; there’s still work to be done—now people are more confident in coming out and admitting that they have mental illness.", "So there is this demand that we have created, and we need to make sure that when people come forward, we have the services. We need to make sure that when somebody comes forward—and it’s still a very difficult decision to come and seek help for mental health issues. It becomes doubly difficult when you make that decision and say, “I need to seek help,” but then you can’t find the door because it is so difficult to navigate the system. I recognize that. We all have friends, family and constituents who often make that difficult decision that they’re now going to seek treatment, only to find that they are not entirely sure where you can go.", "I’m really pleased that, as a government, we have recognized these gaps and we’re working to fill them. I think it has been said many, many times today in the House that the former Minister of Health, Minister Eric Hoskins, captured the sentiment so well when he said, “There is no health without mental health.” That is why our government has truly taken a multi-faceted approach to investing in mental health. That’s why we introduced a comprehensive mental health strategy—Open Minds, Healthy Minds—that is helping to guide the strong action that we are taking to expand access to mental health services and reduce wait times.", "We have made the largest mental health investment in our province’s history, investing over—I can see that my talk is riveting—$10 billion more into the mental health system since 2008. We’re also making additional investments of $140 million over three years, with an increase of more than $50 million every year after that to expand access to mental health services.", "We are the first province in Canada to begin developing a province-wide, publicly funded, structured psychotherapy program. This is a program that is going to help people who have mood disorders like anxiety and depression and give them supports and strategies that they can use to manage their conditions.", "We are creating a network of integrated youth service hubs that will provide one-stop access to mental health services, as well as peer-to-peer employment and housing supports for young people. We also know that housing is a key part of the mental health equation, and that is why we are supporting the development of up to 1,150 additional supportive housing units. That is in addition to the 1,000 new units already added over the last three years to reduce homelessness and improve supports and outcomes for people with mental illness.", "This really is an important issue because mental illness is such a broad range and spectrum of illnesses. We have to look at providing treatments, but we also have to look at, “Can we do more in prevention?” That is why things like social isolation—we know that social isolation can be a high risk factor for people, for instance, developing depression. What can we as a government and what can we as society do to recognize this and to tackle that social isolation early on so that we can prevent individuals from suffering from that sense of loneliness and the depression that can come with it?", "It’s important for us to provide treatments to people who need those treatments, but it’s equally important for us to also recognize that we have to sometimes tackle some of these other issues that can act to help prevent somebody from—some of them; obviously not all mental health issues are preventable. Some are; some are not. It’s a broad spectrum. But we need to focus both on providing the appropriate treatment as well as, where possible, also trying to provide them supports that would help with prevention.", "So I’m really, really pleased. Many of our social programs that we have brought in, whether it’s the basic income pilot, whether it’s the minimum wage—so much of it really does impact our mental health. If you’re struggling to put food on the table after working for 40 hours a week, that is going to make you, perhaps, anxious, or it’s going to have some impact on your mental health. Sometimes we may look at a particular policy in isolation. The same people who say, “We need to invest more in mental health” ought to ask themselves: If you believe so much that we need to invest in mental health, why would you not invest in raising the minimum wage so people don’t have to feel so anxious about their lives all the time?", "It’s really important to connect the dots. That’s where I think the Liberal government has done such a good job, because we’ve actually connected the dots. We don’t look at it in isolation.", "I really have to ask the party opposite. Every single day they stand up, and have recently become champions of mental health. I just want to ask them one question: If you support mental health so much, why would you be against the minimum wage? Because raising the minimum wage actually reduces anxiety levels for people.", "I leave that thought with people to think about. I’m really pleased to speak to this." ],

Although stigma remains a tremendous concern in society, more people feel safe and supported enough to come forward for help. Doing so takes incredible strength, and I want to commend all those who have spoken out. Their advocacy and their voices have truly saved lives.", "However, while we’ve made great strides in our understanding of mental illness, our health care system is failing them when it comes to treatment. For too many in Leeds–Grenville and across the province, that means that the suffering continues as they desperately wait for help.", "I’m proud that our Ontario PC Party is leading the way to change with our motion calling on the government to match the $1.9-billion federal transfer for mental health services. I can’t think of a more needed investment than front-line mental health services to ensure that everyone in a crisis finds help.", "Next week, I’m meeting with a constituent who shared her story about the incredible difficulty she had accessing treatment for a mental illness. What shocked her is that she’s a health care worker. She had the advantage of knowing the system but still struggled to access services. Here’s part of what she wrote to me:", "“What I was not aware of is the obstacles that one has to go through to receive [help]. What would have happened if I were in a place of mind to take my own life?", "“How do citizens with even more severe disorders survive?", "“Now that I have put the deeply personal part of my life out there, I hope it does not fall on deaf ears. Our mental health system is disintegrating and it needs to be rebuilt.”", "Thankfully, she’s in recovery after her painful journey.

I think it was in 2011 or 2012 that I did a survey about health care services in my riding. It was a time when the Liberals were proposing to close my local Welland hospital. As part of that survey, I focused in on mental health services as well in the Niagara region.", "From the survey I sent out to more than 60,000 homes, I got back 1,400 surveys. I asked a question about children and their mental health services: “Has your child ever required mental health treatment? If so, did they get that treatment?” Some 75% of those parents said that their child never got even an initial assessment when they required mental health services, and another, I think, 25% said that the wait time was extremely long. And 50% of the adults who responded to the survey about their own mental health services, or their families’, said that they were not able to access the services they actually needed in the Niagara region. So here we are, seven years later, and we’re still talking about this issue.", "The Conservatives, of course, when they were in power under Mike Harris, closed hundreds and hundreds of mental health beds across the province, and they did not reinvest those dollars into community services. They invested some of the dollars, but they did not take all of those dollars and actually invest them into programs that people could access, which is why we ended up with so many homeless people in so many of our communities. Then the Liberals, for the last 15 years, have continued to close hospitals and mental health beds.", "I’ll bring you back to the Niagara region. At the Welland hospital, we used to have 25 or 30 mental health beds—in the St. Catharines hospital, in the Niagara Falls hospital. When the new hospital was actually built in St. Catharines, they moved all of those mental health services in the Niagara region, which has, I think, a 400- or 500-square-kilometre radius. It’s difficult for people in Niagara, because we don’t have a full, up-and-running regional bus service. All of those beds were cut down to probably 30 beds at most in the St. Catharines hospital, and now people living with mental health issues have to find transportation to get from Fort Erie to St. Catharines or Port Colborne to St. Catharines, which is really problematic for people.", "I want to talk about a positive thing that happens in the Niagara region. We call them the unsung heroes at the Niagara region public mental health programs. They run a myriad of programs and learning groups for people with anxiety, and one constituent I’ve been dealing with is with the early psychosis intervention program. They have one psychiatrist—just one psychiatrist—who comes one day per week from Hamilton. The rest of the program is done by registered nurses and social workers. They also run an education program for families of patients, to support them.", "The vast majority of that caseload is young people—a high percentage of university-aged males with marijuana-induced psychosis, which they believe can be mitigated, and recurring psychosis episodes prevented with adherence to their treatment, to their medication, and consistent follow-up with staff. In the beginning, they followed patients for three years, but recently, according to the psychiatrist, they have experienced a falling back of these young men in general. They’re hoping to be able to expand that program for up to five years, but to do that, they need money, and we all know that the public health budget is less than 1% of the entire health care budget.", "Although there are great programs that exist and there are great workers in mental health, there are not enough of these programs out there to actually meet the demands of all of the people who have mental health issues.", "The building where my constituency office is located was built as a supportive living unit. There are 70 apartments; I think about 62 or 63 of them are for adults living with mental health issues. When it was first built, there were two support workers built into the budget to run that program. But after 20 years, governments actually required that they tender that work out, and they lost these two long-time support workers who reduced the need for them to cycle in and out of psychiatric in-patient units. So an important piece of the mental health issue is also to make sure that there are supports in place if we’re actually going to build accommodations and be able to integrate people in living spaces to make sure that those supports are available to them.", "Thank you for the opportunity to speak to this very important issue." ],

As you may know, Mr. Speaker, my Ministry of Children and Youth Services is responsible for young people who have any form of mental health challenges, and we’ve put forward a plan in Ontario that’s called Moving on Mental Health. The plan is to look at the system as a whole, to look for ways to improve the system by, number one, putting in place 33 lead agencies right across the province—so far, we have 31 of the 33 in place––to better coordinate services on the ground.", "Like many of our agencies and programs that exist here in Ontario, they’ve come from legacy systems. A lot of the organizations that are servicing our communities are through not-for-profits, community-based organizations. They may be government-based organizations—extensions of medical services through hospitals. There are many different options that are available, but the big problem is that the coordination is not as good as it should be.", "For example, in my very city, Toronto, a city I love—this week is Toronto’s birthday. I love this city, but we have a problem in this city in regard to the coordination of mental health services. That’s why we have East Metro Youth Services providing that lead-agency leadership to better coordinate services.", "It is not fair for a family, when they’re in crisis and they have the young person who needs help, to open up the white pages, go on the Internet, or go into a doctor’s office and see that there are so many different forms of options. There needs to be a very clear entry point into the system, and we’ve put forward lead agencies so families can better navigate through the system.", "Some people believe you can just throw money at the system and it’s going to be better, and it’s not the truth. The Conservatives have put forward a motion to invest $1.9 billion into mental health services. This was part of Patrick Brown’s vision for Ontario through his People’s Guarantee platform that the Conservatives have endorsed, but it doesn’t do enough.

This motion says—I’ll read the part where it says that they ask the government to match their $1.9-billion commitment. They ask the Liberal government to match it.", "We’re very clear, Mr. Speaker, that we need a lot more money than that, and we’ve made a commitment that the investment we’ll put forward will be more than what the Conservatives are suggesting. They don’t understand the transformation, the journey we’ve been on for the last several years, transforming the system. We’ve always made a commitment when it comes to youth mental health that, at the end of that transformation, there would be a funding formula shift that would take place. We’ve done some preliminary calculations. We’ve spoken to the Ministry of Health and we know that there is more money needed to help the system, but also coordination.", "I know that now that the Conservatives—I don’t know what they’re going to do with the People’s Guarantee. I don’t know if their platform collapsed and they’ll rebuild it. We’ve heard things. We don’t know where they’re going. But maybe there’s an opportunity for them to match our investment in mental health at this point.", "I don’t want to make this a political back-and-forth, but you can’t just say—the NDP say, “We’ll create a new ministry. That’s the answer.” That’s their solution to mental health. The Conservatives say, “Let’s just throw in $1.9 billion. That’s the answer.”", "Mr. Speaker, system transformation takes a lot of time. It takes the sector participating in that transformation. You have to have conversations with people and stakeholders across the province. You actually have to put in a strategic plan. That’s what leads to system transformation. It’s not about just renaming something—that a new ministry is going to solve everything—or throwing in $1.9 billion; it takes time and dedication for system transformation.", "Look at what we’ve done in public education in this province. When the Conservatives were in power, 66% of young people were graduating; today it’s 86.5%. There was system transformation that took place.", "The Ministry of Health went from the longest wait times in 2003—when the Progressive Conservatives were in power, we had the longest wait times in the country. We’ve transformed the entire system to the shortest wait times in the entire country.", "So it’s not about renaming ministries. It’s not about throwing a bunch of money that’s not even the right amount of money—it’s actually way too low. That’s not the solution. The solution is working with the sector, taking the time to build a strategy, and moving forward together to build a system that actually improves the lives of people.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m sharing my time with the Attorney General.

I used to be part of the literacy sector. I was an executive director for a literacy-based organization. I saw the Conservatives in Ottawa wipe out the entire sector—$27 million with the Harper government—and before that with Mike Harris and the Progressive Conservatives, when they made cuts in the system. The part that really disturbs me, and it actually gets me a little emotional when I think about it—because the party opposite cut 7% to people who needed developmental services, when they were in power. Think about that for a second, Mr. Speaker. How can you trust that party that cut 7% from our most vulnerable?", "When we talk about people who are on social assistance—I believe there was a 23% cut to that budget line.", "And at the same time, they’re spending, they’re proposing deficits. They’ve got a $16-billion shortfall. We know what happens at the very end of that. We’ve seen this all play out before. We’ve seen this movie before. They get into power, and what they do is they make cuts, and at the same time they hurt families.", "I’m surprised that they even have the audacity to think that they have something positive to say when it comes to helping our most vulnerable, because the track record of that party in the past has been so hurtful to the people of Ontario who are the most vulnerable.

It’s an issue we all recognize, and listening to some of the speakers from all parties speak, it’s an issue that is near and dear to our hearts, near and dear to us personally. Most importantly, it’s a need that we recognize as important for our respective communities.", "I’m quite encouraged to see that we are having such an open conversation about the need for more investments in mental health and wellness. That is a good day for us as parliamentarians and that is a good day for this province of Ontario when we, the elected representatives, are keen about discussing how we need to invest more in better mental health and wellness.", "I have heard it said before in this House, and I want to repeat it, that there is no health without mental health. That’s an appropriate sentiment to express. For far too long, our society, broadly speaking, has avoided talking about mental health. For far too long, we have hidden conversations or our own personal fight around mental health—to ourselves—because we have been too scared to expose our vulnerabilities to others. We’re quite comfortable talking about our physical challenges. If you get a broken arm or if somebody is suffering from cancer or heart disease, we somehow, as a society, are fairly comfortable to talk about that. But somehow mental health has not had that kind of exposure or comfort level.", "I think we can all recognize in this House that all of us as individuals know people in our own lives who have suffered from mental illness or who may be suffering from mental illness. I’ve been testing that theory by talking to a lot of people in my community about mental health and wellness. It’s incredible that when people open up, they tell you about themselves or others in their lives.", "There has been the good side. I think there has been quite a bit of evolution in our understanding of mental health issues. We, as a society, have worked hard in breaking down the stigma around mental health. People are more and more comfortable in telling their stories, the stories of their loved ones, and that is also a good thing. But the result of that is that not only are we facing the challenges around mental health, but when you break down stigma, more people then will come out and seek help. That is the time we live in, where more and more people are coming out, be they young or my age or older, seeking help for mental health and wellness. That is why we have to invest in the system.", "I am proud, as some of my colleagues have said and I hope all members recognize, that we have invested new dollars in mental health. Since 2008, $10 billion more has been invested into the mental health system, and that is a good thing. But what I’m also hearing, which is fairly appropriate, is that that may just not be sufficient, that we may have to invest more money in mental health and wellness to meet the increasing demand, to meet the increasing awareness around treating mental health.", "But I’ve been doing a lot of research into this area and I have been talking to a lot of people. I want to particularly recognize the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre that is located in my community of Ottawa Centre for the opportunity to engage me and have conversations. I want to thank the soon-to-be-outgoing CEO and president, George Weber, who has done an incredible job at Royal Ottawa; Nicole Loreto, who is their VP of communications; people like Dr. Raj Bhatla and Dr. Zul Merali, who are doing some leading-edge research and work into mental health.", "The conversation with them and other community partners that I’ve been engaged in was to understand, as we look at investing new dollars, as this motion is suggesting—and we think that we need more money than what’s suggested in the motion, and I don’t think, again, that’s a negative thing. That’s okay to acknowledge. As we look into investing new dollars, is it okay to just throw more money in the system, or do we need to do something more comprehensive?", "My colleague and friend the Minister of Children and Youth Services was talking exactly about that. What we need is a different and more comprehensive approach to deal with mental health and wellness. That would require new money. That would require far more dollars. We think it would require more than $1.9 billion over 10 years. But I think that’s the system-wide approach and conversation that we need to engage in. We need to build a system that is not only available for somebody who is very young and starts experiencing mental health issues because of bullying or other reasons, but then to make sure that it works through the entire system, through the entire spectrum.", "The analogy that I use is that it’s like primary health care. We recognized at some point that, in order for us to live in a healthy society and be able to be healthy personally, we need to invest in prevention. Investing in prevention meant investing in primary health care and making sure people have access to a family doctor or a nurse practitioner or a community health centre, so that they can look after themselves. I’m of the belief—and I’ve been advised by experts in the area—that that’s exactly the kind of system that we need. It’s almost that we need mental health care services at a primary health care level, be it through our primary health care provider, like our doctors or nurse practitioners or community health centres, or at a community setting.", "But we need to make sure that, for people—especially starting young—when they need access to mental health, those services are available, be it in our schools or in a community setting or through our doctors. That’s the investment. That’s the system that needs to be created, so that it is comprehensive and that there are points of intersection in that system based on your need available through the system.", "To overlay that, keep in mind the diversity of this great province. We need to make sure that north and south, the urban and the rural are all covered as well, so the services are not just congregated in urban communities, as sometimes the case may be, and that they are available everywhere across the province. That is another important overlay on creating that system-wide approach.", "Lastly, I want to say that we need to make sure that there’s a continuum of care, so that you have got different people who are able to provide services, depending on their need. It could be a social worker; it could be a youth worker; it could be a psychotherapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist. Depending on your need, you need capacity in the system that can address those different issues. But I fundamentally believe that we need new dollars and new investments—and I think that there is a consensus there—and we need to make sure that we are bringing a comprehensive system." ],

The need to have this debate became obvious with the government’s and the NDP’s rejection to match the $1.9-billion federal transfer for mental health services. Ontario remains in a crisis in mental health, which could be alleviated by the prudent action of government. Here’s why.", "As the number of the children suffering from mental health issues goes up, so does the cost. Ontario’s children’s mental health centres across the province face 24 years of underfunding out of the last 26 years. This means that services and treatment become harder and harder to receive, as the balance between demand and availability become further and further apart.", "Families in desperation seek help in the emergency rooms of local hospitals, but this is another costly move. Hospitals are not necessarily equipped for these visits. Over the last 10 years, children’s visits to emergency rooms and their rate of hospitalization have increased over 60%. This costs the government millions of dollars and—it’s important to recognize—is not as effective as the much lower cost treatment of community-based children’s mental health centres. I can’t overemphasize the importance of that when it allows an opportunity for an adequate funding model that actually has a better return for the children and families.", "The result? When children have been released, it’s back to the centres with long wait-lists again. In York region, there is greater pressure, as the funding is provided on historical patterns. As time has passed, the population has dramatically increased in York region. It would be a major step forward if the current Minister of Health used her influence at the cabinet table to address the decades-old funding model that doesn’t meet the needs of people in York region.", "Today, York still does not implement its funding model on needs-based funding. This only adds further pressure to the problem. It is clear that the gap between the growing population and the budget continues to expand. This, in turn, fails to answer any of the questions for families, for professionals or for care providers.", "In my riding of York–Simcoe, Southlake Regional Health Centre provides child and adolescent mental health services. These services include an in-patient unit, a day hospital program, a disruptive behaviours program, an eating disorders clinic and an urgent care clinic.", "Last year, the South Simcoe Police responded to roughly 300 mental-health-related calls in Innisfil and Bradford. That means, basically, one a day. And that number is growing.", "We need change, which is why we are here today to show the shortcomings of this government. With a commitment from the government, we could look to a future built on a strong foundation of professional providers and parents who are able to be strengthened by a stable funding model. These steps are critical to the mental health and well-being of Ontario children. I am proud to stand with my caucus colleagues to call on this change." ],

While it is, on the surface, a very good motion that is brought forward, I just want to point out that in the motion it does state that we refuse to match a $1.9-billion federal transfer. I’m not sure what magic hat the Conservatives have pulled that out of, because we’ve never said anything of that sort. In fact, I don’t think we’ve ever commented on that at all. So I just want to put that out there. They’ve pulled that out of thin air—making it up on the fly, nowadays, I guess.", "Speaker, I certainly agree that the Liberal government has a pretty sad record when it comes to our health care system in general, especially around mental health supports.", "This morning, I rose and asked a question of the Minister of Health regarding Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare in Windsor. I just want to drive the point home of the dire need that we have across this province, and specifically in my riding, and I’m going to talk about Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare just to put a little perspective.", "There are 2,000 mental health beds in the province of Ontario that are not being used, and the reason they are not being used is not because they’re not available, because they are. It’s because the Liberal government has chronically underfunded our health care system. For the 15 years they have been here—and I will get to the Conservative record when they were government before the Liberals. But for 15 years, they have chronically underfunded our health care system. So we have beds that we could actually see people in and getting the treatment they need if the funding was there to have the front-line workers in place to provide that care.", "So 2,000 beds across the province, and 89 of those beds are sitting, ready to be used, at Windsor’s Hôtel-Dieu Grace hospital. Now, if you figure there are about 80 hospitals in this province that actually provide the targeted mental health supports, those that actually have mental health beds, out of 80 hospitals and 2,000 beds, one hospital in Windsor has 89 turnkey beds: a brand new wing ready to take patients and treat them. We have more than three times the number of empty mental health beds because the Liberal government will not fund those beds so that they can be open and we can have the front-line staff there to provide the care.", "That’s just in Windsor, and their record across the province is, frankly, deplorable. As has been pointed out, there are 12,000 children and youth stuck on a waiting list for care, and 6,500 of these young people have waited for over a year. In London—so not far up the 401 from Windsor—London Health Sciences Centre was at 130% capacity in psychiatric beds every single day between May 1 and September 22 of last year—130% capacity.", "I know that we could talk at great length about the Liberal record. There’s 15 years to talk about, but I don’t have much time, so I want to talk about the Conservative record because it’s their motion.", "We know that the Conservatives, during their time in government, closed 28 hospitals and fired 6,000 nurses. That was under a former Premier. We don’t even have to go back that far. In the last provincial election, in 2014, they ran on cutting 100,000 jobs. Many of those would have been front-line health care providers who actually would have provided care to those who needed mental health support." ],

Between 1996 and 2000, the Conservative government delegated certain authority over a four-year period to the Health Services Restructuring Commission. Basically, what they did was they gave them complete control to go in and say if they were going to close hospitals, if they were going to consolidate hospitals, and which services were going to be cut. This is the power they gave to the HSRC.", "Under the HSRC, in total, 22 communities received HSRC direction, and that resulted in the closure of 31 public hospitals, as well as the closure of six private and six provincial psychiatric hospitals." ],

What are my staff doing? They are working incredibly hard in our constituency offices dealing with people, solving problems. People come to us because they have issues, and I’ll give a very quick one.", "As many of you know, a number of weeks ago, a young child, a three-year-old, was swept into the Grand River. We’re still looking for that child. The family reached out and they had some very specific requests in how we could help. I went to the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. To her credit, she was great—got me the connections. We connected those people together and we’re helping.", "What are we doing with this debate? We’re trying to help people. We have individuals, families, children in our communities who are desperate for service. I’m going to bring it down to a level that I hope people appreciate and understand. When we have an individual who is diagnosed with cancer, we don’t say, “Go away until you’re stage 2 or 3 or 4, and then we’ll try to cobble together some service.” We don’t do that in the province of Ontario. The hard truth is, we do that with mental health. We do that when our families are struggling to find service.", "The Minister of Children and Youth Services talked about how important it was for people to be able to find the service. I agree 100%. Why can’t we have a better system so that when our families or when our partners are looking for addiction or mental health treatment centres, they can find them in an easily accessible, searchable form?", "I’m going to talk, again, about my own community. The Pine River Institute in the north part of Dufferin county is a treatment centre for children who are 13 to 19 years old. There are 29 beds in that facility. They do amazing work. They actually have an 80% success rate, which, for any of you who have any appreciation of mental health and addiction treatment, is an incredible success rate. It’s the only one in Canada—not Ontario, in Canada. We need to do better. Their wait-list is literally in the hundreds.", "Now, I get it. Not everybody can have a Pine River Institute. But does it not speak to gaps in our system when 13- to 19-year-olds are waiting months for service? What does that say about the value of that life? What does that speak to about what we are doing as legislators?", "So, yes, we can nitpick that we don’t like your $1.9 billion and we’re doing more, and this is more important. We can do that, and we have the ability to do that. But can we please remember that it’s about people, it’s about families, it’s about young people who are literally waiting at the end of the phone for someone to say, “I’ve got you a spot.”", "I participated in the mental health and addictions select committee. Why did I participate in it? Because I was trying to help a family and I couldn’t find any service. And suddenly it becomes real to us. It becomes a real issue, because you start making those phone calls and reaching out to those professionals and treatment centres, and you realize just how insurmountable a problem this is when that family is trying to find service. So let’s stop the “yours isn’t as good as mine” conversation and let’s start the “how do we collectively make it better?” If you don’t like ours, fine. Then fix it so that we can talk about some other options, please." ],

In 2012, the Premier issued his infamous secret decision to go to zero dollars for horse racing—zero dollars, Speaker. The government was told by one of their own long-time insiders, John Wilkinson, that cancelling slots at racetracks could mean 24,000 job losses and 27,000 dead horses. They went ahead with it anyway. That speaks to the lack of respect we see on that side of the House for rural and small-town Ontario, just as much today as back then.", "It’s the reason I asked the minister to do the right thing and apologize to the town of Ajax and the horse people across the province. Unfortunately, the minister’s response was the usual sour cocktail of political spin and ducking responsibility.", "In his response, the minister claimed that he is going to work with the community to make sure that quarter horse racing has a bright future. And yet, it’s the same minister who spilled the beans about the government’s secret plan to rip the slots out of Ajax Downs, a move that, if allowed to go through, will almost certainly destroy quarter horse racing in Ontario.", "The minister also dredged up old news about the Slots at Racetracks Program in trying to justify his government’s callous decision to end it. Of course, the Slots at Racetracks Program wasn’t perfect. We could have worked to fix the shortcomings. Instead, the government decided to go with the nuclear option. The Liberal party even ran nasty radio ads condemning the former PC leader, Tim Hudak, for standing up for horse racing and horse people in this province. The industry hasn’t forgotten who stood by them and who left them high and dry.", "I also found it rich that the minister called the member for Ajax–Pickering a “tireless defender of horse racing at Ajax Downs.” After all, that same member was, until recently, waving the pompoms for the Durham Live proposal that would see slots taken out of Ajax Downs. I have a letter here that he wrote in April 2015 to the former transportation minister, Steven Del Duca. With regard to Durham Live, he wrote, “We wanted to ensure that you were aware of the scope of the project and its potential benefits for Pickering, Durham region, and all of Ontario.” I wonder if that member could explain exactly how the project would benefit the 1,700 people who will lose their jobs if the Ajax casino closes, or the countless others whose livelihood depends on quarter horse racing.", "From day one, the members on this side have stood with horse people in Ontario. Our platform makes important commitments in this area, including a new horse racing scratch ticket and improved sharing of off-track betting revenue with community racetracks. More importantly, our record speaks for itself. I’m sad to say, so does the Liberals’." ],

Unfortunately, I’m here tonight talking about this answer.", "What this stems down to is the fact that this government, over its 15 years, has walked away from consultation with front-line health care providers in the province. It’s unfortunate that in this day and age we are having situations come forward where the government is making decisions without discussing the issues with those who are delivering health care in our province.", "It really relates to the fact that their battle with Ontario doctors is now at a three-year impasse.

Not only do they invest in their own offices to have the proper medical equipment and to be on call for their patients 24/7, they also are hiring community members as staff in their offices. They are providing employment for this area.

I know they’re planning on moving it into the hospital, but maybe a discussion with this doctor about providing services, to continue on, may have been the best course to go. His staff are probably going to lose hours, maybe their jobs. Who knows about access—because now you’re moving it into the hospital bureaucracy, and we know how the LHINs operate with regard to hospitals. They ration the care. This government likes to freeze the funding within our hospital system. You only have to look so far as the London area where a week ago the London Health Sciences Centre was announcing that non-elective surgery—the bypass surgeries that are needed to keep people alive—are being postponed and cancelled because there are no beds available. You only need to look at the fact that people who are getting sick outside of the country and needing emergency care to come home aren’t having access to the beds to get the care that they need. You look at poor Mr. Cline, who passed away because he was stuck in Mexico.

I know that he’s listening to it right now. I’m sure that he agrees with me on that, as it would be disappointing for it to be otherwise.", "We’re committed to equitable access to quality care in all regions of Ontario, and we will continue to work with our care partner to help patients get diagnosed faster. We’re adding new state-of-the-art medical imaging equipment, including PET/CT scanners, where they can best serve patients.", "We’re working with Cancer Care Ontario to ensure that PET/CT scanners continue to provide high-quality diagnostic imaging services for all Ontarians by planning their replacement in a timely manner and by prioritizing additional equipment in new locations. Cancer Care Ontario is currently working on a long-term strategy with an approach that considers several factors, such as service needs, patient referral patterns, age of machine, downtime and facility capacity.", "To date, Ontario’s PET program has 14 PET/CT scanners in 12 centres across the province. Cancer Care Ontario is working on a long-term strategy that will support sustainable and equitable provincial infrastructure across the province.", "To launch this long-term strategy, we’re providing Windsor Regional Hospital with a new PET/CT scanner to help open a new site for scanning services in the Erie-St. Clair region. Responding to the growing needs of the community, up to 600 patients a year will benefit from the new PET scanner. Increasing access to diagnostic services is part of our plan to create fairness and opportunity during this period of rapid economic change.", "The decision to help the Windsor hospital open a PET/CT scanning site is to reduce the likelihood of patients experiencing a service disruption from an existing scanner. This scanner is the only one serving patients in the Erie-St. Clair region. The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care is investing $4.6 million in capital spending to help build additional space at the Health Sciences North PET scanner up in Sudbury. This is in addition to $1.6 million announced in December 2015 to cover operating costs.", "We need to have an effective fleet of PET/CT scanners to continue to provide patients with important diagnostic services. Our ministry is working closely with Cancer Care Ontario to ensure that the provincial infrastructure and equipment for PET services are up to date and located throughout the province to ensure equitable access across the province.", "The existing PET/CT scanner at Precision Diagnostic Imaging—PDI—is operating beyond its expected lifespan and has been experiencing irregular, unplanned downtime. During these downtimes, patient care in the region is impacted through increased wait times and extended travel distances.", "The new PET/CT scanner at Windsor Regional Hospital reduces risk associated with the aging scanner at PDI and will support patient access in the Erie St. Clair LHIN to ensure no impact to patient care in the future. According to the Independent Health Facilities Act, the ministry cannot provide capital for IHFs. IHFs are required to have a functional PET scanner to become part of the PET program.", "To mitigate these issues, Windsor Regional Hospital was chosen as the first site to receive a new PET/CT scanner as part of the long-term strategy. Windsor Regional Hospital has the space and capacity to accommodate the new PET/CT scanner and is best positioned to ensure continued PET access to patients in the region.", "It’s also important to note that the ministry communicated this decision with the clinic prior to the announcement, and as the head of the hospital’s nuclear medicine department, he will be taking a leadership role in the implementation of the new PET scanner at the Windsor Regional Hospital.", "Speaker, I think I’ve answered the member’s question. I hope he was listening to it, because I firmly believe that if you ask a question, it’s only polite to listen to it. I hope he’s listening." ],

I rise this evening to speak to you, as I did this morning, on the growing mental health crisis in Ontario’s schools and classrooms.", "In my role as the official opposition critic for education and post-secondary education, I meet regularly, as you would expect, to discuss the current challenges in Ontario schools with students, parents, teachers, education workers and a variety of other stakeholders in the education sector. In those discussions, there’s unanimous agreement that the growing mental health needs of students is the most significant challenge in our schools and communities today.", "The Ontario Student Trustees’ Association earlier this year called on the government to fund suicide intervention and mental health training programs to deal with this mental health crisis. Additionally, the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation recently released their election platform for 2018. In that platform, they call for a best-practice student services model that, among other recommendations, includes:", "—an increase in school and community services available to students with mental health issues;", "—predictable, stable and dedicated funding which will ensure a high level of service across the province regardless of school board; and", "—increasing mental health literacy for educators.", "The growing mental health crisis in our schools is also being raised by many teachers and trustees in our local communities and at larger association meetings. To that point, I had the opportunity to participate with the Minister of Education in two panels hosted by the Ontario Catholic School Trustees’ Association and the Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association. Many of the trustees and teachers in attendance rightly asked about what could be done to deal with the growing student mental health crisis, because they, like the Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus, recognize the importance of addressing the students’ mental health crisis now, and they rightly wanted commitments.", "I was pleased during those panels to highlight the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party’s commitment to mental health, which I echo again tonight.", "Students suffering from mental health issues need a comprehensive approach from this government to mental health services and programs. It’s time, Speaker. It’s time the mental health issues in the classroom and beyond get the same attention and prioritization as physical health. It’s time for Ontario to replace fragmented mental health services with a comprehensive approach which helps our most vulnerable, particularly students.", "The federal government made a 10-year, $1.9-billion commitment to mental health in Ontario as part of their most recent health transfer agreement with the province. The Ontario Progressive Conservative platform will match that 10-year federal commitment, with the goal of creating a comprehensive mental health treatment system in Ontario addressing the needs of all Ontario residents, including students, teachers and education workers.", "Among other areas, this funding would include topping up elementary and secondary school supports for services targeted at improving mental health and well-being, including funding awareness campaigns and investing in mental health services, such as suicide prevention counselling and services specifically for native populations through a preventive mental health team that deals with northern communities. This funding, Speaker would include expanding the Crisis Outreach and Support Team pilot project and investing in data collection regarding mental health, addictions and treatment to identify and fill gaps in care.", "During question period on February 20, 2018, in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition on mental health services, the Premier said, “Let me just say to the Leader of the Opposition, to the Legislature and the people of Ontario, we recognize that there is more that needs to be done.” The Premier went on to say, “I am the first to agree that there is more that we need to do to make sure that there’s coordination of services, to make sure that there are more services in terms of counselling and professionals.”", "The reality is that the growing mental health needs of students in our schools have not been a priority for the Liberal government. Speaker, Ontario families like yours and others we have the privilege of serving deserve to know that their loved ones will be able to get mental health care when they need it. They deserve no less. That’s why the Ontario Progressive Conservaive caucus has raised and will continue to raise the issue of mental health, and why I asked the Minister of Education today when the Liberal government will finally address the growing mental health crisis in Ontario schools." ],

We know that there is no student well-being without an investment in mental health.", "Our previous minister has said that there is no health without mental health, and that’s so true. That’s why I took issue today when the Leader of the Opposition stated that the previous minister did not care and made a mockery of people’s suffering from mental health. That’s so far from the truth, and that statement I think, Speaker, was disingenuous, to say the least. Our health minister has said repeatedly—" ],

Well-being goes well beyond $1.9 billion; it’s other supports that are in place: proper housing, proper wages for people.", "In this House, the opposition party voted against an increase in the minimum wage that also supports families, keeps families together and allows single mothers to spend more time at home with their kids. Mental health is a collective effort. It’s no single one thing. It’s a community of us working all together and making sure there are supports in place for students.", "We heard that student achievement is directly linked to well-being and mental health, Mr. Speaker. Kids succeed in an environment that is inclusive and supportive. The pillars are there to support our renewed vision for education. That’s why we’re investing an additional $49 million over the next three years to promote and support the well-being of Ontario students, including mental health.", "Mr. Speaker, we recognize that educators are in a unique position to recognize the first signs that a student might be struggling with mental health issues at school, and we are working with boards to equip educators with the tools needed to intervene with care.", "Our government is committed to achievement, equality and well-being, including supporting student mental health. We know there is more work to do, as the Premier rightly alluded to in her remarks during question period. We are working with the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and the Ministry of Children and Youth Services to create a fair and equitable mental health system focused on better services, better access and higher quality, using a whole-of-government approach.", "Mr. Speaker, let me tell you about some of the mental health supports we have put in place in our schools. We are increasing funding for school mental health by $6 million over the next three years to promote student mental health and well-being across all school boards.", "We are investing in mental health leaders in each of our 72 school boards across this great province, and we are enabling school leaders to develop and implement a board-level comprehensive student mental health and addictions strategy. Since 2011, we have invested more than $62 million in mental health and addictions, in addition to $1 million to the Kids Help Phone to support students with toll-free 24-hour anonymous phone and web counselling services.", "The Conservatives have come up to the table with $191 million extra each year over the next 10 years, for a total cumulative investment of $1.9 billion. This is not historic, to say the least. For the record, we think we can do better, and we will do much better." ],

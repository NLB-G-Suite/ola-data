I’ll offer a few remarks at the beginning but, obviously, the parliamentary assistants, on both of these occasions and both these instances, are individuals who have developed an expertise in this field and will be speaking on behalf of the government.", "We agreed, you will remember, to reduce auto insurance rates by 15% on average by August 2015, and we’re still on target to meet that particular goal. Since setting that goal last summer, we have seen rates stabilize and come down, on average, by about 6%. But of course, we believe that’s not enough. There’s more to be done, and we introduced legislation last spring that would work to achieve this plan. Unfortunately, the opposition forced an unnecessary election that froze our work, and that’s why today we’re here, working to pass this legislation again to further fight fraud, reduce costs and lower rates for Ontario drivers.", "I must say, in my time in this House, the issue of auto insurance in general has come to the attention of the Legislature on many occasions. It’s usually when the premiums rise in a significant way that it gains the attention of the Legislature and ultimately, of course, the public, who will witness this happening to themselves and to others. That is why the government seized upon this as being a very significant issue early on, under the auspices, particularly, of the Minister of Finance, but we have two parliamentary assistants today who will look at it from different angles.", "One of the things you recognize, Mr. Speaker—we have a different Speaker in the chair now, the member for Chatham and other areas in that area, Chatham–Kent and—" ],

I just wanted to let his constituents know that he was here and presiding at this particular point in time.", "There is a saga to auto insurance in this province. I can recall, as I say, on many occasions—when new governments come in, they try to tackle these particular challenges, and have been somewhat successful over the years. There is a recognition that there’s a relationship between the costs incurred and the premiums paid. The question always is, how much of that is significant in terms of the premiums rising?", "I remember in 1990 being in this chamber and, with much fanfare, the NDP government of the day was sworn in for government. I knew number one in their platform, or at least very high in their platform, was public auto insurance. So I waited for those five years to see whether, in fact, there would be public auto insurance introduced in the province, because it had been promised for years. They said, “Well, the New Democratic Party, what are they about?” They’re about public auto insurance.", "But lo and behold, I think a very detailed analysis was done for the province of Ontario—because, remember, public auto insurance had been in place in other provinces. An analysis was done by the government of the day, who didn’t want to break a promise. They weren’t about breaking promises; they did not want to do it. But they took a very careful look at the circumstances that existed at that time and chose not to proceed with public auto insurance. That’s a decision any government can make at any particular point in time. I noticed in the last provincial election that the New Democratic Party did not promise public auto insurance.", "I think we recognize that there’s a challenge for people out there, and the purpose of this legislation is to deal with that particular challenge, a lot of it related to fraud. There are some towing circumstances that people have encountered over the years. They say there could be—and I think they are right—a reduction in costs if there were changes made in that regard and others, but I don’t want to intrude too far into the speaking time of the two parliamentary assistants who are going to follow me at this time.", "Suffice it to say, with some historical perspective, every government has tried to deal with this, and the circumstances change over the years; it’s not one circumstance facing everyone. I’m going to recall a bit a circumstance when I was Minister of the Environment in 1985. There was an insurance crisis at that time. There had been some significant court cases—some of them had not actually completed, but they were court cases that came forward that scared everybody, to be quite honest about that, including municipalities. Even getting insurance was becoming a problem because the reinsurance business, the insurance companies that insure insurance companies, were at that time quite worried about the circumstances that existed. And here I was, as Minister of the Environment, trying to proclaim what was called the spills bill.", "Now, the spills bill was a bill which dealt with environmental spills. It really put the onus on the spiller, if you will, to clean up and look after the problem immediately. Some said that it was reverse onus, and I guess it was to a certain extent, so it was controversial. It had passed under a minority Parliament, the minority Parliament between 1977 and 1981—I must say, by the way, Mr. Speaker, a minority Parliament that in my view worked very well. Unlike the last minority Parliament that we had, I thought the one between 1977 and 1981 worked well. Let me tell you why that was. Remember there was a minority Parliament between 1975 and 1977—very raucous, very disruptive; it worked enough, but there were a lot of challenges. People hadn’t had experience with a minority Parliament for a long time. Mr. Davis called an election to gain a majority. He fell short of gaining that majority, so we were in a minority Parliament again.", "What happened on that occasion was that the government became much more responsive to the opposition, and the opposition became more responsible in terms of what it was doing. So I thought in that period of time—and I want to give Mr. Davis, who I know will be watching from his home in Brampton at this time or his office in Brampton, some considerable credit for the way—and Bob Welch, by the way, who was a House leader. I want to give them credit for the manner in which they operated the minority Parliament at that time. I want to give credit as well to all the House leaders who worked together to make Parliament work. There were actually a lot of bills that were passed on that particular occasion. So that’s the context.", "Now we are into a majority Parliament again. The people of Ontario have made a decision. We have a majority Parliament, and we’re now able to deal with a piece of legislation we just couldn’t get moving in a minority Parliament. In fact, in the last minority Parliament, it was hard to move any legislation through, which was unfortunate. Then we ended up with an election that I’m sure the member for Renfrew did not want, but there we were, in an election. His leader and others—the hawks, as we call them—had been calling for an election. The New Democratic Party pulled the plug, and we were thrust into an election that I don’t think many people in the province wanted, but they did make a decision.", "Now we’re before this House with a piece of legislation which I think will have—" ],

I will be sharing my time with the member from Newmarket–Aurora and also the member from Eglinton–Lawrence, who I believe would like to add something to the second reading of Bill 15.", "I am very honoured to rise today for second reading of Bill 15, the Fighting Fraud and Reducing Automobile Insurance Rates Act, 2014. This legislation proposes a number of much-needed measures to help protect Ontario drivers, tackle fraud and abuse, and reduce costs and uncertainty in Ontario’s auto insurance system. If passed, Bill 15 will build on the work done to date to stabilize and bring down auto insurance rates, including the substantial 2010 reforms that streamlined the system, gave consumers more choice in their auto insurance policies and cracked down on fraud and abuse.", "There are more than nine million drivers in Ontario. Some of these drivers are still paying too much for auto insurance. I’m sure that, as members of this Legislature, we all hear that in our constituencies from time to time. Our government made a commitment to making auto insurance more affordable while keeping the system fair and reliable. Bill 15 would make good on that commitment and help bring down average rates for Ontario drivers.", "In August 2013, we announced our Auto Insurance Cost and Rate Reduction Strategy. We’re targeting an average 15% reduction in auto insurance rates over two years. How are we working to achieve that target? A key element of our strategy is to bring down costs in the system and reduce uncertainty. Auto insurance rates are directly linked to claim costs. Every dollar paid out in auto insurance claims is funded by policyholders, so if we reduce the costs, we can help reduce the rates.", "One significant cost driver in the auto insurance system is fraud. Recognizing this, in July 2011 the government formed the Auto Insurance Anti-Fraud Task Force based on a commitment made in the 2011 Ontario budget. The task force was created to bring together stakeholders and government to collaboratively review the issues and recommend some solutions.", "In 2012, the task force issued its final report. It found that auto insurance fraud is indeed substantial and has a material impact on premiums. Research conducted on the task force’s behalf estimated that in 2010, costs related to auto insurance fraud amounted to between $770 million and $1.6 billion. So tackling fraud and working to reduce it has been an ongoing priority for our government.", "The task force made 38 recommendations to combat auto insurance fraud. So far we have taken action to address more than half of these, and we’re committed to addressing the remaining recommendations over the coming months. Bill 15 contains important measures that would not only continue our crackdown on fraud, but would also address other critical issues in the auto insurance system to help reduce costs and uncertainty, and ultimately rates, for Ontario drivers.", "Mr. Speaker, our cost and rate reduction strategy is working. From August 2013 to August 2014, auto insurance rates dropped by an average of over 6%. While we’re pleased with this reduction, we recognize that we still have a ways to go to reach our 15% target.", "If passed, Bill 15 would help us get there. The measures being proposed by this legislation include transforming the auto insurance dispute resolution system to make it more efficient and effective, and discourage fraud and abuse. The legislation would propose consumer protection to towing and vehicle storage industries through measures that tackle questionable business practices, and provide authority to address vehicle storage and related issues identified by the anti-fraud task force.", "In addition, the amendments proposed provide new enforcement tools, such as allowing inspectors to issue orders where violations are found. I believe that’s very important. Bill 15 would also modernize insurance agent and adjuster disciplinary hearings, which would protect consumers and build on past changes to enhance the regulator’s investigation and enforcement authority. As you can see, this proposed legislation is comprehensive in its approach to fighting fraud and abuse, improving consumer protection and strengthening Ontario’s auto insurance system.", "The proposed Fighting Fraud and Reducing Automobile Insurance Rates Act, 2014, is a combination of two pieces of legislation that died on the order paper when the 40th Parliament of Ontario was dissolved: the Fighting Fraud and Reducing Automobile Insurance Rates Act, 2014, originally introduced on March 4, 2014, and the Roadside Assistance Protection Act, 2014, originally introduced on April 15, 2014. The measures included in these two bills are so vital to helping to protect Ontario drivers and fighting fraud in the auto insurance system that we simply had to reintroduce them.", "I’d now like to provide some details about these measures and outline why it is important that Bill 15 has all of our support. Since 1990, mediation has been a mandatory first step for disputes between claimants and auto insurers over the entitlement to, or amount of, statutory accident benefits. The dispute resolution system, or DRS, as it’s also known, was intended to help drivers and insurers resolve disputes quickly so that injured drivers got the health treatments they needed to get better. This system was administered by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario, also known as FSCO.", "However, in recent years, the system became overwhelmed and bogged down with applications. There are major backlogs that created uncertainty and elevated costs. On top of everything, injured drivers were waiting too long to get the benefits they needed.", "We are proposing to change the DRS to help injured Ontario drivers settle disputes faster.", "Last year, we appointed the Honourable J. Douglas Cunningham, a former Associate Chief Justice of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, to review the system and provide us with recommendations on how to make improvements. There was an extensive consultation process, which included input from 35 stakeholders, written submissions, in-person meetings, as well as an interim report.", "The final report was delivered on February 18 and made 28 recommendations to transform the DRS so that it operates more efficiently and effectively, which would reduce consumer frustration, uncertainty and costs. Bill 15 is proposing to implement a number of these recommendations.", "If passed, Bill 15 would create a new framework for the DRS by moving responsibility to an existing tribunal administered by the Ministry of the Attorney General, which would be the Licence Appeal Tribunal. The objective is to establish a more expedient, efficient and cost-effective system. The move would also remove adjudicative functions regarding statutory accident benefits from FSCO to prevent conflicts in its role as the regulator of insurance companies. This is an important step. The resulting reduction in costs and uncertainty would lead to more long-term stability in claim costs, which would ultimately lower rates. More importantly, it would provide claimants with faster access to the benefits they require.", "Drivers involved in traffic collisions or in need of roadside assistance should have the confidence that the tow truck driver helping them will do the work safely. If passed, Bill 15 would help us achieve this important goal. We’re proposing consumer protections to address the towing and vehicle storage industries, a key measure that was recommended by the Auto Insurance Anti-Fraud Task Force. The changes that we’re proposing would, if passed, help Ontario drivers make informed decisions when getting their vehicle towed or having it held in a storage facility.", "Mr. Speaker, the proposed legislation and supporting regulations, in due course, would require tow and storage providers to get authorization from the consumer, or someone acting on behalf of the consumer, before charging for towing and storage services. Tow and storage providers would also be required to make their rates available publicly. They would also have to accept payments by credit card from consumers, and, before demanding or receiving payment, tow and storage providers would have to provide an invoice, including an itemized list of the services provided and the total cost. Finally, in most cases, consumers would have access to their towed vehicle to remove any property contained in the vehicle. These proposed changes were developed through extensive consultations with stakeholders held earlier this year.", "In January and February, 2014, representatives from the municipal, policing, towing, insurance, vehicle financing and leasing, and other sectors met to consult on the oversight of the towing and storage industries. The group worked together to develop recommendations to government which we are now proposing in Bill 15.", "But that’s not all, Mr. Speaker. We are also proposing to amend the Highway Traffic Act to include tow trucks in the province’s existing commercial vehicle operator’s registration system. The new legislation would allow us to set qualifications and standards governing the operation and the use of tow trucks, including driver certification and training requirements, and prescribe penalties to violators. This would help improve road safety through monitoring and enforcement, another important consumer protection measure.", "Another way that we are helping to protect drivers is by proposing to provide authority to reduce the number of days a vehicle can be stored after an accident without giving notice to the owner and other persons where required. Regulations could also provide for the determination of fair value of storage where an amount has not been agreed upon.", "Currently, when a vehicle has been damaged in an accident, it may be brought to a storage facility after the collision by someone other than the owner, or without the owner’s authority. Those who store vehicles after accidents can begin charging for storage services right away, even though the owner of the vehicle may be unaware of where their car is located and that it is accumulating charges every day. Storers can hold a vehicle and accumulate storage charges for up to 60 days without giving any notice and then still claim a lien for the storage costs. The Auto Insurance Anti-Fraud Task Force noted that storers can maximize their lien by delaying notice until the 60-day period has almost expired, and the vehicle’s owner or insurer may be liable for these inflated costs. So reducing the 60-day time period would cut down on abusive practices by some storers and would remove the associated costs from the auto insurance system. If passed, the proposed amendments would help address another of the task force’s recommendations. I believe this is a very important one that really needs to be passed as quickly as possible.", "Another measure proposed by Bill 15 is to modernize the system for insurance agent and adjuster disciplinary hearings. Streamlining the disciplinary process would support quicker regulatory action against agents and adjusters who are engaging in cost-generating deceptive and often fraudulent actions. For example, one insurance agent who had their licence revoked was caught using insurance company funds to cover their own business expenses. This is unacceptable. If passed, FSCO would have the authority to revoke or immediately suspend the licences of agents and adjusters who act improperly and put the public at risk. Bill 15 would also align the process for these disciplinary hearings with modern principles of procedural fairness, including replacing the 90-year-old advisory board system with the existing Financial Services Tribunal. If passed, these amendments would help combat fraud and protect consumers by building on previous changes Ontario has made to expand and modernize FSCO’s investigation and enforcement authority, particularly in the area of fraud prevention. These are much-needed measures that would help protect Ontario consumers.", "Because auto insurance fraud is so prevalent and costly, we’re tackling it from many sides. In addition to the measures being proposed in Bill 15, our government has committed to establishing a serious fraud unit whose mandate will include addressing auto insurance fraud. Automobile insurance fraud is part of a wider issue of white-collar crime that costs Ontario citizens, companies and financial institutions hundreds of millions of dollars each year. A special unit with a mandate to tackle serious fraud, including auto insurance fraud, will support the key principle established by the Auto Insurance Anti-Fraud Task Force that fraudsters should be vigorously pursued and prosecuted where warranted.", "Bill 15 also proposes a long-overdue measure that will help modernize the auto insurance system. If passed, this legislation would amend the Insurance Act to align the prejudgment interest rate for non-pecuniary loss, also called pain and suffering damages, for individuals injured in a motor vehicle collision to reflect market conditions. The current prejudgment interest rate on damages for non-pecuniary loss in a personal injury action is set at 5% per year. Meanwhile, the prejudgment interest rate for most other damages is based on Bank of Canada interest rates and calculated quarterly. Currently this rate is 1.3% per year. The 5%-per-year prejudgment interest rate for damages for non-pecuniary loss in a personal injury action increases the cost of bodily injury claims in the auto insurance system, which drives up costs for all consumers. This rate has not been adjusted since 1990. Linking this rate to current market conditions would help reduce the cost of bodily injury claims in the auto insurance system while still ensuring fairness to consumers.", "In conclusion, as I have outlined, Bill 15 would bring much-needed changes to Ontario’s auto insurance system. It is the next step in our commitment to keeping the system fair and affordable for Ontario drivers. That is why I ask for the support of the House in passing this act.", "Thank you, Mr. Speaker." ],

If these legislative changes are passed, they will help strengthen consumer protection, improve road user safety and reduce automobile insurance fraud.", "Most of the tow truck and vehicle storage operators in Ontario provide top-notch service to their customers and contribute to keeping our roads free and clear by removing vehicles, including those involved in collisions, quickly, efficiently and safely. However, some towing and storage operators simply do not meet the standards expected of them. Serious concerns have been raised about some operators in the industry by consumers and by the Insurance Bureau of Canada, among others. We know, for example, that some tow truck drivers charge exorbitant rates, leaving vulnerable accident victims shocked and distressed. We know, for example, and many of us have heard stories of people going to pick up vehicles from storage lots, only to find they’ve been asked to pay unexpectedly large amounts of money before their vehicles are released.", "It’s worth noting that from a road safety perspective, tow truck drivers also have very high collision rates, caused in part by aggressive driving when they try to get to a collision scene first. According to the Ontario road safety report, tow trucks in Ontario had a 19.7% collision rate in 2010. That’s compared to 1.1% for other commercial vehicles and 3.3% for private passenger vehicles. Drivers involved in traffic collisions or in need of roadside assistance should have the confidence that the tow truck driver helping them will do their work safely and fairly.

Mr. Speaker, as you know, auto insurance is really a necessity of life for all Ontarians. We all have to have an automobile, a safe automobile, and we all have to have some insurance because of the possibility of something occurring when you’re driving your car, so we don’t have much choice. It’s not a matter of choice, it’s a matter of prerogative; we have to have our vehicles and we have to have auto insurance.", "I have been involved over the years with this interesting topic. I go back quite a number of years with auto insurance. Over the years, I’ve learned a lot by talking to a lot of the people on the ground, whether they be insurance brokers, whether they be auto body repair shop operators, tow truck drivers, insurance agents, people who are in the medical side of insurance or people in our government here, experts like Phil Howell, who is the director of the Financial Services Commission of Ontario, FSCO. There’s a lot that you learn.", "The thing I learned most is that this is a most complex series of issues. Sometimes we do more harm than good when we think there’s a quick fix or a silver bullet: “Reduce my rates and I don’t care about anything else.” But as you know, the consequence sometimes is that you may not get the coverage you need if you happen to be in an accident. You may not get the repair to your vehicle or the compensation you may require if, God forbid, something happens to you or one of your loved ones in an accident.", "That’s why it’s not just a matter of, “Just lower my rates and I don’t care what the consequences are.” There are consequences with everything you do in this industry. It is extremely complex because it’s not just about the insurance companies. It’s not just about the insurance brokers or the government at FSCO. The insurance industries, as I call them, are made up of many component parts.", "Insurance in Ontario involves the tow truck industry. Those are the vehicles that tow people on a regular basis who have been in an accident. It involves the legal community—the paralegals who are expert in certain areas of law and who are very involved in auto insurance. Then, the lawyers. There are all kinds of lawyers involved in the insurance industry. If you look at the ads on TV—the slip-and-fall lawyers. They’re advertising like crazy: “If you get in an accident, call us.” If you go to some parts of Ontario, you see big billboards: “If you get in an accident, call us.” In many cases, they do some good work, but in many cases, there are people, sometimes, in the past, who have taken advantage of people in car accidents.", "I spent some time at the TTC, and on a regular basis the TTC deals with fraudulent insurance claims—almost on a daily basis. I know that my fellow members from Scarborough remember this. There was a bus full of people—I think it was on Lawrence Avenue in Scarborough, on a Sunday night, which is quite unusual. You don’t usually see a bus full of people in Scarborough on Lawrence Avenue. Somehow this bus full of people rear-ended a truck in front of them—Sunday night at about 8 o’clock.", "Everybody on the bus sued the TTC. I remember the TTC lawyer at the time—an excellent lawyer. He decided to challenge this, because he said, “It’s quite unusual to have a bus full of people all suing us for whiplash on a Sunday night in Scarborough.” In their investigation, they found that this was a staged accident. The guy driving the truck in front of the bus stopped abruptly so that the bus ran into the rear of the truck. The driver of the truck was being paid off by some fraud artists. Everybody on the bus who sued the TTC for whiplash got 500 bucks from the person who set up the staged accident. But this took the TTC about five years of legal manoeuvring and legal costs to deal with this one staged accident.", "I use this as an example of the type of thing you’re dealing with with insurance and vehicle accidents as to what could happen. And the repercussions? People say, “It’s just the TTC; they can pay. It’s just the insurance company; they can pay.” But as you know, we all pay. This type of organized fraud forces all of our premiums to go up. Sure, the insurance company will pass it on to us in higher premiums and they’ll pass it onto our companies and insurers etc. So everybody pays for these fraud artists. There isn’t some nameless insurance company that pays for all this; we pay through our premiums.", "There are the people in the auto body repair industry—it’s a huge industry in Ontario: people who repair cars and trucks. They’re involved in insurance. It’s a multi-million dollar industry that employs thousands of people. They’re in the insurance business.", "Then there’s the whole massage industry. I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but there are all kinds of people employed in massaging people who get into accidents.

At one time, there were people from organized crime who were buying these massage spas treating people in automobile accidents. They would drive you to the massage spa in their limos.

Thousands of physiotherapists are involved in treating people who are victims of automobile accidents.

Then doctors for the accident victims do assessments. So they might do 10 assessments for one minor car accident. There are many medical doctors involved in the insurance industry.", "Lawyers, as I said: There are thousands of lawyers involved in the insurance industry. There are also the insurance brokers, who are people that represent individuals who take out insurance from an insurance company. They are your representatives. When you want to buy insurance or you have an accident, they act as your advocate.", "There’s another part of insurance where you don’t need a broker. They’re called direct insurers. You just deal with the company directly. You don’t have an agent or a broker; you deal directly. That’s another complex part of insurance: the direct insurers, as opposed to the ones who work with brokers.", "These are multiple layers of industries that employ tens of thousands of people in this thing called auto insurance. When you talk about auto insurance, it is not just about dealing with an insurance company and how they operate, or just dealing with the legal system, or not just dealing with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario. There are a dozen industries within the insurance industry. So when this government has tried to basically manage and improve this industry and make it fairer, more transparent, it is not an easy task.", "As the member from Barrie said, just dealing with the tow truck industry itself is very, very complex. The majority of tow truck operators are very legitimate people, experienced truckers. They have good track records. But then there are the other so-called tow truck operators. They will show up at an accident. As soon as the accident occurs—bang—they’re there on the spot. They say, “Don’t say anything. Don’t do anything. We’ll take your car to fix it. We’ve got a lawyer for you. We’ve got a doctor for you. We’ve got an insurance company for you.”", "The tow truck operator is the first entry point for insurance. They show up on the scene. A poor person is traumatized by the accident, so this tow truck driver becomes their advocate on the scene. Away goes their vehicle. In some cases, that vehicle may never be seen again, because once you give away that vehicle, they can keep it for 60 days.", "In fact, here’s an example. I know that in my own community, there is an auto body repair shop owned by this guy named Rocky. Across the street is a Mazda dealer, right on Dufferin. There’s a Mazda dealer and Rocky’s auto body repair shop.", "A customer comes in to Rocky and says, “I just got in an accident, and my new car is across the street at the Mazda dealer.” Rocky phones up the Mazda dealer and says, “Listen, I’ve got the customer here. He’s the owner of that car. He wants me to repair the car.”", "The dealer said to him, or somebody in the dealership said, “Well, if you want the car, it will cost you 2,000 bucks.” Rocky said, “Two thousand bucks?” “Yeah, there’s an administration fee. Two thousand bucks.”", "The car was driveable, Rocky said. You could just bring the car across the street from the dealership to Rocky’s and have it repaired. “No, we won’t release the car.” But the owner called the dealer and said, “Release my car.” He said, “No, 2,000 bucks, because we brought the car here to our shop. We had to do all this work to drive it here and drop it off. We had to do all this paperwork. Two thousand bucks or you don’t get the car.” Then the guy said, “Well, it doesn’t matter. The insurance company will pay for this.”", "So in order to get the car over to the auto body repair shop of choice, which was the owner of the vehicle’s choice, they had to pay $2,000 to the guy across the street to release the car, to take the ransom. That’s what it is, it’s pure ransom.", "Now, that’s one example, Mr. Speaker. This has been going on by the tens of millions of dollars across Ontario for years, where these vehicles have been taken from accident scenes, held to ransom and the owner can’t get it, your auto body repair shop can’t get it. So that’s why we are now trying to get rid of this hostage-taking of vehicles in accidents with this bill. That’s one aspect of trying to provide for rules for tow truck operators. It’s the Wild West out there. There are many good ones, but as I said, there are some that are just exploitive. That’s why we need this kind of legislation to help ensure that these added layers of costs are removed from the system, because if we continue to have this kind of hostage-taking of vehicles, if we continue to have this attitude of “Well, the insurance company is paying for it”—it doesn’t matter whether somebody’s committing fraud, it doesn’t matter whether somebody is taking you to a physiotherapist in a limo, we have to get rid of this approach.", "Now, it doesn’t mean that getting rid of all this fraud is the only answer and is going to be the magic solution to making auto insurance fair in Ontario. My main point is that there are many other aspects to it, because I guess four and a half million drivers—maybe I’ve lost track of that, but there are just so many people driving, so many insurance companies, agents and all these other industries related. This bill attempts to come to grips with the reality of the auto insurance industry and to make it more transparent, more reasonable, an attempt to bring down rates, but it is not going to be the magic elixir. There is a lot of work to be done, and it’s going to be a continuing amount of work with everybody in partnership.", "As drivers, we have to understand that we have a responsibility and we can’t continue to have that attitude of “Well, the insurance is paying.” You know, whether you’re in the auto body repair business or a tow truck business or the legal profession or all these others—the paralegals, the massage industry—we have to say that we all have to do our part and government has to do their part to undertake this serious, comprehensive partnership in making auto insurance fair and available to everybody, because you cannot drive in Ontario without it.", "I suspect, Mr. Speaker, because of higher rates, there are probably a lot of people driving without insurance. You talk to your police friends and they’ll tell you how many people they stop on a regular basis who don’t have insurance. You’re probably young enough to remember, Mr. Speaker, when we used to have that $25 thing we used to pay for liability back in the old days, so everybody got at least some kind of protection from being hit by someone without insurance. But nowadays, again, there are a lot of people driving without insurance that we have to do something about, too. That’s why we need to make insurance affordable, fair and available in all parts of the province, because this problem of fraud, it’s sad to say—it isn’t everywhere in the province. It’s maybe not a serious issue in Chatham-Kent and the good people there and Merlin and those places; there are a lot of good people there. But it is a serious problem in the GTA. It seems to be, sad to say, where a lot of this untoward activity is taking place. Maybe it’s the critical mass of people that are here.", "Then, Mr. Speaker, the other question I’m sure you’ve asked yourself is, with all these safety devices in cars—you know, we’ve got cars that can see from the inside lane the outside lane. They’ve got sensors on them. They’ve got the anti-lock brakes; they’ve got the anti-skid mechanisms; they’ve got cameras out the back, the side, the incredibly good tires and the bumpers. Yet despite all these safety devices, the cost of accidents is going up and up and up. People are claiming more injuries from accidents than ever before, despite all these safety devices. And remember, one of the most important things, Mr. Speaker, as you well know, being an avid driver yourself, is the airbags. How many airbags? They’ve got 10, 20, 30 airbags in cars now. How can anybody get hurt with 10, 20, 30 airbags? But they are getting hurt and they are claiming injuries to their insurance company. So we’ve got all these safety features and yet the costs and the number of injuries are going up.", "In Ontario, the cost of a claim compared to Alberta, for instance, is almost twice as much—just taking an approximation on that. So if you get in an accident, the same accident in Ontario costs twice as much to pay for that claim as it does in Alberta. Same cars, same good Canadians, yet our claims in Ontario are so expensive. Why? Why?", "The other thing I wanted to mention, too, is that in insurance, at one time there used to be—well, there still is—a place for people who have many accidents. If you’ve got multiple accidents, you have to go into, like, insurance purgatory. I can’t remember the name of the place now, but—" ],

  "text" : [ "Facility, yes. I remember that at one time we had thousands of people in Facility, because what the insurance companies would do—if you were in a couple of accidents, they didn’t want to insure you, because the insurance companies want to pick the people that are lowest risk. So they would say to you, “We don’t want you. Go over to Facility.” But in Facility, instead of paying $5,000 a year or $2,000 a year—you might pay $10,000 a year for your insurance in Facility. Facility was filled with people, because the insurance companies didn’t want to cover all these people who were in accidents.", "One good thing is that the number of people in Facility has been reduced dramatically. Where before there were thousands in Facility, now there’s hardly any. That’s one good thing, because all the insurance companies are supposed to take reasonable people as customers.", "As they say, not all insurance companies are the same. Like I said at the beginning, you can go through a direct insurer where you just get on the phone with someone and they insure you directly with an insurance company, or you can go to your friendly local broker, so that person is your advocate. That’s why I always tell people—insurance is a very complicated thing but a very important thing. So if you’re going to get insurance for your kids, if you’re going to get insurance for your partner, it’s important to go and talk to someone who knows something about insurance and do some research. Don’t just get the lowest price. You pay for what you get. Now, you may get the lowest price and a great deal—that’s very possible—but you can’t do it by just reading an ad on the back of a bus or something. You have to do your research as a consumer, and we as a government have to be doing more to protect consumers so they don’t get taken advantage of and we educate them.", "The other thing I would mention that is coming and that I think is a very positive thing in insurance is telematics. This is going to be really helpful to young drivers and new drivers because, as you know, when you’re a new driver, it doesn’t matter whether you’re the 17-year-old just getting their licence or whether you’re a newcomer to Canada from Scotland or something: You pay a very high rate as a new driver because you have no Ontario experience.", "What is happening technologically is, there are these telematics systems coming into place where there’s a little device in your vehicle that can record how fast you drive, what kind of stops—are you doing those drag-racing takeoffs and so forth? What time of day do you drive? I know that some parents of young teenagers really love this system of telematics because they want to know how their son or daughter is driving. You can say to them, “Well, son, I trust you with the car. Here’s the car. Go out there and don’t speed. Be very careful. I don’t want you driving around midnight; just drive when you have to go to work.” You can have that recorded through this telematics system that’s available from companies now here in Ontario, all over North America and in England, where it started. That’s going to be a way of saying to young drivers, “Listen, the recording of your driving habits and patterns will be given to the insurance company on a regular basis. They can see if you are driving at a safe rate of speed, what time you’re driving etc., and because of that, we can give you a lower rate.”", "If they notice in the digital reporting that you are speeding constantly, they give you a warning; in fact, they text you because it’s usually for young people. They text and say, “Johnny, in the last week, you’ve been going over the speed limit constantly. Johnny, if you don’t stop that, your rate is going to go up.” So they give them a warning. Then if Johnny keeps speeding, they will then see that rate go up, and dad will say, “Johnny, look, I’ve got to pay another 200 bucks a month for your insurance.” For young people, it can be very, very difficult and expensive to drive a vehicle and get insured.", "So this telematics system that’s becoming more and more in vogue in Ontario, as it has been all over North America and England, will be a feature that will encourage young people and new drivers to drive safer and, at the same time, be able to be used as a tool to reduce rates. So that’s a good thing that’s coming through technology.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that all these aspects of insurance that I’ve talked about, I hope, reinforce the point that I made at the beginning: It is a very complex system. We need everybody working together to bring down rates, to make insurance more transparent, to make it more beneficial for the insured and to make it, again, more understandable.", "This Bill 15 takes on a lot of hard, challenging issues. As I said, it is a bill that tries to solve some of these problems. We can’t expect everything that this bill purports to do will come out in perfection, but it is an extremely thoughtful, well-researched attempt at solving some of these problems. There have been a lot of stakeholder meetings. There’s been a lot of input. They had the task force that met. All partners in insurance have tried to participate in bringing about some needed remedies to make auto insurance better, more available and more transparent for all Ontarians who need to drive, need to have insurance.", "Again, I encourage everyone to take a good look at this bill.

This has resulted in lots of bureaucracy and lots of legislation piled on top of one another. It’s making the system too complicated and, in the end, very costly. In fact, we now have the highest auto insurance rates in our country.", "It’s important to note that we’ve heard from stakeholders, including advocates for accident victims, who have concerns about this bill, and there are concerns around the aspects of the legislation related to the changes affecting the towing industry. I think it’s important to listen to those concerns to see if there are improvements we can make to this bill in committee and to address those.", "This bill essentially merges Bills 171 and 189 from the previous Parliament. It addresses five priority areas relating to auto insurance in Ontario. The Liberals are touting this bill as part of their cost reduction strategy intended to help deliver 15% in savings to drivers, which we all know they have been failing at. Overall, the bill is a big step forward, but there are very few significant cost savings that will be achieved by this bill.", "On the whole, it is supported by the insurance industry because they consider it a step in the right direction. So tomorrow, when we do our party’s leadoff hour-long discussion, we’ll get into the amendments that we specifically feel we should be making which will help make this bill a truer, better bill." ],

The situation happened on city road 4 that leads into the Fairbanks area and the Fairbanks park. The road out of the area is the only operational access to the area. Chicago Mine Road has been closed to … traffic most of the summer and remains closed due to a washed out bridge that has not been repaired. Any assistance or advice … would be … appreciated....”", "Here’s his story. He says:", "“Michael Vagnini and I spent some time this morning in an area of flooding on Fairbanks Lake Road”—that’s regional road 4—“just north of Worthington where the road was flooded. The situation was life threatening for anyone in a vehicle smaller than a pickup truck and there were numerous tandem trucks with trailers passing through the area making it even more dangerous. Potholes in the road below the surface of the water were deep enough to cause my 4 wheel drive to hit the frame on two occasions and one trucker indicated that the front wheel of his tandem had dropped in a hole that reached the front axle. A lady with a toddler passed through the area at high risk as did an elderly lady who came close to nose diving into the ditch while we were there. Fortunately neither vehicle hit the potholes that I had or … the trucker was talking about. Had either vehicle gone into the ditch the current was so rapid and the ditch so deep as to preclude any attempts at rescue and they would have perished.”", "I don’t wish any harm about anybody, but when the status of our roads is so despicable, accidents are just a matter of time." ],

In the tow truck industry, it has been a big problem.", "I just want to share with you that I was a municipal councillor elected to the amalgamated city in 1997. In 1998 we decided to tackle the tow truck industry in the city of Toronto. I will tell you that I got corralled by tow trucks on the highway. I got threatened. It is a goon industry, if I can call it that way. The reason I think it is that way is because a lot of these tow trucks are licensed by municipalities. No two municipalities have the same set of rules.", "I think the government is going in the right direction to try and bring it all under one roof. It’s the same with the medical claims business—to try to centralize it and screen it so that the fraud will stop, because I know tow trucks operate with body shops; body shops operate with the physiotherapy place; they operate with the chiropractor. In my own riding, and my colleague from Scarborough–Agincourt’s, we probably pay 20% more in insurance because our area has been hit with a lot of these claims.", "I support this bill; I think we should move it forward, but I want to say one warning to all of us: This industry is so big and there are so many small issues all over the place that this bill is not going to be the be-all and end-all.

They connect us to the information and resources we need to succeed in life, at school, and within our jobs. Libraries give us access to great literature, to music, and to film; resources that help people develop all aspects of their lives and innovative new technologies that provide creative opportunities.", "Through strategic investments like the Ontario Libraries Capacity Fund, we’re ensuring that Ontarians have access to high-quality services and information, and we are committed to making services in public libraries and across the province even better.", "Mr. Speaker, I’d like to take this opportunity to recognize the great work that the staff do in all of our Ontario public libraries across this province to promote education and literacy, and contribute to the health and well-being of our communities.", "I encourage all Ontarians to visit your local library this week and get involved in the exciting lineup of events planned in communities across the province that celebrate and honour our public libraries." ],

I would also like to thank my friend the Honourable Jim Bradley, my predecessor, for his work on this very important issue.", "Our government sees climate change as an existential threat, which is why I joined nearly 400,000 other people marching through the streets of New York City to call for action during Climate Week last month.", "If the nations of our planet cannot achieve a peak in emissions within the next few years on the path to net zero greenhouse gas emissions, by mid-century, then we are inviting the unthinkable. Business as usual on a global scale means we will see a mean temperature rise of between three and five degrees Celsius in the second half of this century. That would itself cause global catastrophe and massive loss of life, as well as the extinction of most of the species on this planet.", "US Secretary of State John Kerry put it succinctly, when speaking to the UN Climate Summit last month, when he said, “The science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand. We don’t have time for a meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society. And in a sense, climate change can now be considered another weapon of mass destruction, perhaps the world’s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.”", "In the words of former US Treasury Secretary and Republican Henry Paulson, “Viewing climate change in terms of risk assessment and risk management makes clear to me that taking a cautiously conservative stance—that is, waiting for more information before acting—is actually taking a very radical risk. We’ll never know enough to resolve all of the uncertainties. But we know enough to recognize that we must act now.”", "Fighting climate change has the potential to create unprecedented economic growth around the world, but especially here in Ontario.", "During Climate Week, Secretary Kerry also showed us that we are standing on the verge of a massive opportunity. Moving to a low-carbon economy will unleash a new era of prosperity in the western world six times greater than the $1-trillion tech boom of the 1990s. That’s a $6-trillion opportunity in non-greenhouse gas-emitting vehicles, renewable energy, and durable rather than disposable products. But governments have to be prepared to take action and seize this opportunity.", "One of the major reasons I joined this government in 2010 was because of Ontario’s leadership on climate change. Mr. Speaker, Ontario has bettered its 2014 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 6% below 1990 levels, making it one of the only jurisdictions in the world to be below 1990 levels. Along with Quebec, we are two of a handful of jurisdictions that have achieved this.", "We have to see enough other jurisdictions achieve reductions below 1990 levels to avoid this impending catastrophe. This is why Ontario is working with Quebec and California to build momentum for deep greenhouse gas emission reductions across North America, on the path to the 2015 UN climate conference in Paris.", "Eliminating coal-fired generation in Ontario was critical to our fight against climate change and is the single largest greenhouse gas emission reduction initiative in North America. In 2015, we will introduce a climate change strategy to achieve essential greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2020 and for all the years up to 2050.", "We are not just fighting climate change. Through our government’s investment in people, building modern infrastructure, and a dynamic and innovative business climate, we are actually delivering a low-carbon economy. Ontario can be a major part of the solution to this global challenge and a leader in this new economy.", "We have a lot of work to do, but we don’t do it alone. In August, our Premier, Kathleen Wynne, and Premier Couillard of Quebec agreed to renew their strong partnership and focus on these key initiatives. Deputy ministers from both provinces will be meeting regularly to update and strengthen bilateral collaborative agreements, with a priority on climate change issues. We hope to build on this strong relationship and tackle our climate change goals together.", "This government will continue to take strong action on the defining issue of our generation. Between our ongoing investments in technology, our commitment to clean energy and our continued partnerships with our allies, Ontario will be a leader in the fight against climate change. In the coming months, we will unveil our climate change strategy to avoid the unthinkable, while seizing hope and the opportunity that only transformative leadership can deliver." ],

The diversity of crops, whether it be squash, pumpkins, apples—we’re blessed with so many different commodities in the province of Ontario.", "I’ve got to point out that Ontario ag week was a private member’s bill introduced way back when by MPP Bert Johnson, a former member for Perth.

We think that, for people earning the lowest incomes in Ontario, simply tying it to the increases in the consumer price index—these are the people who are most affected by those increases—that this is just the right thing to do. That’s why we introduced this legislation.", "I was also very pleased yesterday to listen to the members on all sides of the Legislature talk about how important it is to protect vulnerable workers. By acting to strengthen workplace protections for the most vulnerable and increasing fairness for employees and businesses, we build a stronger workplace and we’ll build a stronger economy and thus a stronger Ontario.", "We all recognize here that the nature of work is changing and we have to change our rules to keep up. A significant portion of vulnerable workers have been immigrants, women, young workers and individuals in minority ethnic groups. These individuals often start in precarious jobs. In drafting this legislation, we built on reports from people like the United Way and the Law Society of Upper Canada, and we also consulted with 14 other provincial government ministries, as well as with the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board.", "We have proposed this bill because it’s the right thing to do for vulnerable workers and for businesses. By acting to safeguard workers who need our protection and helping responsible, law-abiding businesses stay competitive, we are protecting Ontarians and working to strengthen our economy.", "Our legislative proposals respond to these key recommendations in recent reports from our stakeholders, and they include:", "—eliminating the $10,000 cap on recovery of unpaid wages and increasing the period of recovery to two years for employees;", "—making client employers who use temporary help agencies liable when agencies don’t pay certain types of wages, encouraging those companies to use agencies that treat employees fairly;", "—extending the Occupational Health and Safety Act coverage to unpaid co-op students, other unpaid learners and unpaid trainees; and", "—prohibiting employers from recovering certain costs and seizing personal documents like passports from all foreign employees, not just live-in caregivers, by extending the application of the Employment Protection for Foreign Nationals legislation to cover all foreign employees who come to Ontario under an immigration or foreign temporary employee program.", "The number of temporary foreign workers in Ontario has risen from 91,000 in 2008 to 133,000 in 2013. It is fair, and our responsibility, to protect them, and now is the time to act. No one should ever have to surrender their passport or leave their country and come to Ontario because they are promised a job that doesn’t exist, or be charged for inappropriate recruitment fees.", "That is why the proposed legislation would amend the Employment Protection for Foreign Nationals Act, 2009, that our government introduced and that was passed. We would amend this act to apply to all foreign employees in Ontario who are here through immigration or temporary foreign employee programs. This means foreign employees in Ontario would be protected from illegal recruitment fees and from having their passports or other documents withheld by their employers.", "Under Bill 18, the Employment Protection for Foreign Nationals Act would be extended to cover approximately 110,000 additional temporary foreign employees. It prohibits recruiters from charging any fees to the person, either directly or indirectly. It prohibits the employer from recovery of recruitment and placement costs. Importantly, it prohibits reprisals against individuals for exercising their rights under the act.", "It requires that the employer provide information sheets about the employee’s rights under the act, and also requires employers and recruiters to maintain records. It will prohibit an employer or recruiter from taking possessions or property, including personal documents, from the employee. It contains no monetary limit on the recovery of monies pursuant to an order under the act, and it also provides a 42-month time limit on filing claims under the act.", "Extending these protections to most foreign employees in Ontario will help ensure that these workers get treated fairly, regardless of occupation or skill level. In the debate yesterday, the member from Essex put it very well when he essentially said that we all believe here that when people come to Ontario to work, Mr. Speaker, we want them to be treated fairly and ensure that they have the same rights and responsibilities as residents here in Ontario. I’m very proud of these measures in the act.", "As well, there are going to be changes to the Employment Standards Act with respect to the recovery of wages. There will be a removal of the $10,000 cap for the recovery of wages. People work hard for their money; at the end of their shift they expect to be paid. As well, if they operate a business, they deserve to know that their competitor is not unfairly advantaged because he’s not respecting the Employment Standards Act.", "Right now, there are both time and monetary limits on recovering wages. By making it easier for employees to get money owed them—by proposing to remove the $10,000 cap under the Employment Standards Act, and on the recovery of unpaid wages through a Ministry of Labour order to pay—it means the employees will no longer be forced to pursue large claims in the courts, saving employees and businesses both time and money.", "Mr. Speaker, you can imagine being a person who is working at minimum wage or just above and who has a case for recovery of wages because they were unfairly treated. It would be easy for that amount, over the period of a few years, to get up into the range of over $10,000. It would be virtually impossible for them, without the assistance of somebody in the community, to take an employer to court. Some employers would be unfairly advantaged in that circumstance, so I think that this measure in the bill is very important and will go to level the playing field.", "The legislation will also increase the time limit for recovery of wages through an order to pay under the Employment Standards Act to two years. We’re doing this so older claims are dealt with fairly and employees get the money they’re owed. We all believe that people should get paid for the work that they do.", "We’re the only jurisdiction in Canada that currently has a cap, and it’s important for us to remove that right now, so vulnerable employees who have larger claims will be able to go forward with that.", "Court proceedings can also be a disadvantage for small businesses, and this will be a savings to them as well.", "One of the important things the legislation also does is require the employment standards handout to be given to all employees.", "Now, having had a background in business and working in both organized and non-union shops, I know the difference between people understanding what their rights and responsibilities are. I think especially with young workers, vulnerable workers, workers who are earning minimum wage, they’re very easily taken advantage of. I know in our own circumstance at home, our youngest son, James, had a job at a local gas station and was often asked—I wouldn’t say “asked”; he was often told what he was going to do. Some of those things included double overnight shifts because somebody didn’t show up—they didn’t have an option—and working alone in those circumstances. So making sure that people, employees and employers, understand the rules is very important to making sure that that relationship works and that everyone is treated fairly.", "Mr. Speaker, the bill also speaks to temporary help agencies, and there are provisions around joint and several liability which simply say that any business engaging a temporary help agency will be liable for wages that are unpaid by that agency. I think this levels the playing field. It encourages employers to use agencies who are scrupulous. It will ensure that those employees, the people who are vulnerable, the people who are missing their paycheque, will be fairly dealt with.", "This, of course, builds on the legislation we introduced with regard to temporary help agencies in 2009 that made sure that employees were not unfairly prevented from being hired directly by agency clients and prohibited agencies from charging fees to workers for such things as resumé writing and interview preparation. It also requires agencies to provide employees with information about their rights under the Employment Standards Act.", "Again, in yesterday’s debate—I mentioned the member from Essex a couple of times, but he did say a couple of things that struck a chord with me in regards to extending health and safety initiatives of the Ministry of Labour to cover unpaid learners.", "We know that workplaces can be dangerous places and that it’s a perfectly reasonable thing to extend to those people who are in those workplaces the same protections that a paid employee has. Many of these students are young people. They’re learning a job; it’s an opportunity. It’s very important that they understand their rights and their responsibilities to other workers in the workplace. It will also give, in the event of an unfortunate incident—and we heard of a few of those. We all know of a few of those in our communities where an unpaid learner is injured at work. This will give an opportunity for the ministry to be able to investigate. They can’t do that right now. Again, I think that is just the right thing to do, it makes sense, and I’m glad that it’s in the bill.", "There was another issue that came up yesterday that was a matter of some debate, and that was in terms of the employment standards self-audits. Mr. Speaker, in order to proactively protect the rights of workers, the legislation will give the Ministry of Labour the authority to require employers to conduct self-audits to determine compliance with the Employment Standards Act. The intent of this proposal is to provide a tool to promote compliance with the ESA and expand the program’s reach in a very significant way, in a way that is efficient and cost-effective. It’s an important complement to inspections.", "I want to just expand on that a little bit and say that the ability to comply, self-audits, will go a long way to create awareness. It would also go a long way to institute a sense that there is going to be enforcement. In many organizations we do health and safety audits. Those are things that are required in the workplace. They create an awareness around doing that, and I believe it is something that works hand in hand with enforcement. That alone will not force an employer who isn’t complying to comply, but it is an important tool. I think it’s important that it’s in the bill. It’s one piece of that puzzle.", "Again, to go back to one of the last changes in the Labour Relations Act, which is to strengthen the Labour Relations Act by proposing to reduce the collective agreement open period in the construction industry from three months to two, as a member put it very well yesterday, if you can’t organize in those two months, maybe you shouldn’t be organizing. I fully support this measure in the bill.", "I look forward to the continuation of the debate this afternoon. I think this bill—again, I don’t think it’s too big a bite of the apple. To wrap up, I think the provisions around tying minimum wage to the consumer price index are fairly straightforward and simple. I think all of these measures that we’ve put in the bill we’ve debated before. One part of the bill has been through two other sessions before this. I think these are all timely things. It’s important that we protect those workers who are most vulnerable in our communities and in our province.", "I fully support this bill.

They are importing food into this country that is directly competitive with the products that are grown in Ontario. They have rules and regulations that are different than ours. They can use pesticides that we can’t, in other countries; their labour force works for a lot less money than, certainly, what our labour force works for in Ontario.

I don’t necessarily disagree with everything he had to say, but I would say, when you talk about the minimum wage, when you talk about reducing poverty, the minimum wage is but a small—very important, but a small—piece of the puzzle when it comes to reducing poverty. I think what we need are more better-paying jobs. We need an affordable housing strategy. We need more money to increase access to public transit. We need to have safe and affordable daycare, so parents then can afford to go out and look for work and make money and bring it home without paying every cent of that back into child care. I’m very delighted to hear the federal NDP policy that they’re proposing, once they form the next government in Ottawa, of $15-a-day daycare. That should be supported in this House, because we all know the importance of good, safe and affordable child care.", "When these people come home after earning more money—a good wage, a higher minimum wage—they can then go out and buy fresh, nutritional, Ontario-grown fruits and vegetables, and put a nutritious meal on the table for their family and for their loved ones. That’s one of the benefits of having more money coming into the family, more money coming into the household income.", "I think that what we have to do when we talk about the people who earn minimum wage and need more money—these aren’t people who go out and buy RRSPs. These aren’t people who have been doing financial planning for 20 years down the road. These are the people who will recirculate that money and put it right back into the economy—right back into the system, if you will, Speaker. That money will be used and reused, and all of us in Ontario will benefit." ],

Also, in my riding there are seniors who have had to supplement their income by taking minimum wage jobs in order to supplement their retirement income.", "This is a fair way to do it. There is a system put in place so that it will go along with the CPI, and there will be six months’ notice for businesses.

I think we need a government in this province who will actually step forward and focus on well-paying middle-income jobs and creating the environment so that jobs will return to our province, so that people can actually afford a house, raise their children, have them go away to university and start their own lives.", "This is a government who, in their time over the last 15 years, has destroyed 6,000 manufacturing jobs out of my riding through their policies of high energy rates, high taxation and just blowing the deficit every year—6,000 high-paying jobs, 6,000 jobs where people were making $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 or $90,000 a year.", "Now these people are left with nothing. What they’re left with is the promise of this government to create more minimum wage jobs, jobs where they aren’t able to raise a family, aren’t able to pay for their kids to go to school and aren’t able to enjoy life as people would like to do in this province. For this government to continually focus on minimum wage jobs—let’s wake up over there and actually have some economic policy to create high-paying jobs for the people of this province.", "Of note, though, with minimum wage jobs: I have talked to a local farm producer in our area who grows quite a bit of fruit. With the last minimum wage increase going forward, he has totally ended a whole crop. I think it was melons that he was growing. He can no longer actually afford to grow them and have them harvested under the increase in the minimum wage, and this is only going to compound further going down.", "Now, I’m not against raising the minimum wage up, but the rate at which it was raised sent shockwaves through the farming community. If there are ways to have better fruits and vegetables on the table at the end of the day, raising the minimum wage and causing farmers not to produce—I’m almost done, Speaker—the proper fruits and vegetables—in essence, we’ll be bringing them in from Mexico and such at a higher price.

One of the things she was doing was wrapping a lot of bills that were in the previous Parliament. They’re being reintroduced into this Parliament, but they’re being rolled into other bills, so two-for-the-price-of-one or three-for-the-price-of-one kind of thing. It’s kind of a special going on here, except that the opposition doesn’t get to vote on each portion of the bill; they only get to vote once. She’s creating a number of omnibus bills. That’s a big word—not a big word but it has a big meaning. I don’t want to be quite so exact about that because they’re not stacked three feet high or anything, but they are rolling other items into bills that didn’t exist before, such as Bill 15, which now has the towing regulation changes in it that were in a bill that was, I think, Bill 178 in the last Parliament. In this bill, of course, they’ve brought the minimum wage issue into some labour standards changes as well.", "The challenge for opposition always is—it’s like the budget. You listen to the guys on the other side—and I don’t mean specifically “guys”; I mean the folks. You listen to the folks on the other side, and of course we voted against the budget. I’m proud to have done so, proud to have done so, and my people in my riding must have agreed with me, because just as the member for Barrie says that she believes the government must have this mandate to do whatever they want because they got elected, well, I no more believe that than I believe that the people in my riding gave me a mandate to stand against everything you do." ],

On any bill, there may be some components of a bill that I would like to vote in favour of, but if the bill in its entirety is not one I support, then I have to vote against the bill.

It’s not that we are diametrically opposed to any part of the bill, but we do think it requires some explaining—a little splainin’ to do.", "I want to touch on that, because it would have been great if the government would have had a separate piece of legislation, as has been the practice in the past. When they’ve introduced minimum wage legislation in the past, it has been done as a separate piece of legislation. It would have been good if they had done that. It would have given us an opportunity to debate specifically on that issue.", "So let’s talk about the minimum wage issue. Some of our members have spoken about how perhaps it would have been nice to have a separate agricultural sector wage scale, if you want to call it that, because we’re trying to be competitive with an awful lot of jurisdictions. Agriculture is the kind of business that you work some long, long hours in stretches, because you’ve got to make hay when the sun shines, as the old story goes. It requires, sometimes, a different look. You have to look at it from a different perspective than you might some other jobs that are specific that you’re going to do this job, work this many hours that day, and continuously repeat that over the period of time that you have that job.", "The other thing is the retail sector. It’s very competitive. The member from Ottawa South would know that there’s a new retail Tanger mall opening up in Kanata. That’s going to change the retail landscape in Ottawa and, in fact, in much of eastern Ontario, because these things have an impact. So we have to be cognizant at all times about what the environment around the business sector is with respect to what we do in reference to enforcing a wage scale on them.", "I know when this debate was going on earlier, and I’ll give the government credit—are you listening, the member from Barrie?

I know the ones in my riding would have been significantly hurt by it.", "It’s not just the fact that it increases the minimum wage, but what it does is, it puts pressure on every other wage within that organization. Because when the people who are making above the minimum wage are made aware that the minimum wage has gone up, they immediately want their wages to be adjusted commensurately. They want to have the same treatment. So what it does is inflationary.", "Some of the statistics that my colleague from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington brought forward yesterday were very, very interesting. I’ll say one thing: When it comes to the numbers, he does his homework. We saw that the 15-to-19 age group makes up 42% of the people that make minimum wage. That’s the way it was designed, so that entry-level positions would start at the bottom of the ladder. You can’t make the guy the CEO of the company day one on the job—unless you came as a CEO from some other company. You’ve got to start somewhere. But what we found was, they only make up 4.9% of the workforce but over 42% of the minimum wage jobs. He also found that the average wage in that age group—even though the legislated minimum wage was lower in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland, the average wage actually paid to the people in that group was much higher.", "What that tells you, Speaker, is that Ontario is lagging behind in the creation of good-paying jobs. The challenge to the government is not simply—you can’t just legislate. You can pay a minimum wage of $30 an hour, if you want, but that will just destroy your economy. Everybody could make a million dollars a year. The only thing you could ever do is spend the money at home, though, because you couldn’t spend it anywhere else. You couldn’t trade with anybody. We live in a global market today. The world is smaller than ever and you’ve got to be aware of what is going on all around you. When you make these changes within your own borders, you have to be aware of how that affects your ability to work outside your borders.", "What the government has failed to do is to create those jobs that actually pay more. In fact, Ontario has the highest percentage of workers working for the minimum wage. So they’re not doing their job. What they need to be doing is helping create the circumstances, helping create the environment that encourages employers to create those higher-paying jobs. Our economy is driven much by government policy. And they’re failing in that regard. If they were creating those jobs, it wouldn’t matter what the minimum wage was. If the unemployment rate was not higher than the national average for, what, 96 months consecutively here in the province of Ontario, we’d have a competitive environment for jobs and for workers here that would naturally drive up the wages for everyone. Because if there are 10 people looking for 10 jobs, it’s a perfect balance; but if there are five people only looking for 10 jobs, you’re going to have to pay more to get somebody take those jobs. You’re going to have to pay more because you don’t have enough people looking for them.", "We’d never likely be in that place in Ontario. But if we were in a position where there was more competition for the jobs, more competition for the people looking for the jobs, that would naturally drive up the amount of money we would have to pay for them. The free agent in the NHL, the guy that scores the 50 goals? He pretty well writes his own ticket, because it’s really hard to find a lot of 50-goal scorers out there.", "In the minimum wage market in Ontario, we find people that we can put in those jobs every day because there are so many people out of work in this province. The government should be looking at themselves and asking themselves, “Are we actually doing what we need to do to create the environment or help create”—governments don’t create jobs; I’m not suggesting that. But you have to set the foundation. You have to incubate the conditions, so that everybody out there who believes that this is the place to establish a business, to become, maybe not wealthy, but at least comfortable—if this is the place, then it’s your job as government to try to help that along and maybe start the process a little bit.", "Stop worrying about some of the things you people worry about all the time—the rinky-dinky stuff, the stuff that you like to make headlines in the papers with—and start thinking about the jobs, not just for the people today, but for the generation following us. These young pages sitting in front of the Speaker here: What kind of economy are we going to have in Ontario when they hit that market? What kind of opportunities are they going to have for long, fulfilling careers here in the province of Ontario, ones where they can be satisfied—when the day comes when they’re going to pack it in, announce their retirement or whatever—that they’ll have been able to work in an environment that allows them to have provided for a comfortable retirement in the next days of their lives?", "I want to talk a little about—oh my goodness, that clock. Is that clock running fast? Can somebody check that clock? I think it might be running fast, Speaker. I want to talk about another little section of the bill, and that is with regard to—I just have to pull that bill out here for a second, and get my glasses on. I do wear them for reading, you know.", "Oh, yes: the two-month open periods to establish a union in a shop, two months to organize. It’s not a bad idea; the member from Ottawa South rightfully indicated that, if you can’t organize in two months, maybe it’s not there for you. But it goes back to some of the other changes you made back in 2003 or 2004—card-based certification. The way you did it, all you have to do is have a majority of the employees in the shop sign a card, and that shop is now a union shop.", "I’ll tell you a little thing about what happened in Arnprior. On the 30th of December last year, 2013, Lorne’s Electric in Arnprior was visited by a fellow from the IBEW, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. We heard about the boss that lives in Shawville, Quebec; he was donating money to Liberal candidates in the election, and somebody caught him. That’s a no-no, Mr. Speaker, but I wonder why he was donating money to Liberal candidates—perhaps because Liberal candidates were ensuring that his agenda would be furthered. Anyway, it was illegal for him to do that, and he was caught.", "Anyway, on the 30th of December, on a day that the shop was actually officially closed, there happened to be three employees there. Coincidental? I don’t know, but down comes the organizer from the IBEW. He raps on the door, and two of those people signed a card. Eric Glahs’s business, Lorne’s Electric, was now unionized, a business that had been in existence in Arnprior for 70 years.", "On September 25, Eric Glahs closed the doors on Lorne’s Electric. Yes, they were going to work with him, all right. In that period of time, his expenses went up by over $450,000. He closed the doors. He’s 54 years old, and now he doesn’t know what the next step of his life is going to be.", "You have to ask yourself—on December 30, two days away from New Year’s, he is visited by, in my opinion, a predator from the IBEW, who unionizes his shop, getting two people. Between 35 and 40 people work there, but because two people signed a card, he now became unionized. He’d never had any trouble with his employees, but now the shop is closed.", "The same thing happened a couple of months later to another business, in Killaloe, and I haven’t spoken to that gentleman about whether or not I can speak about his business, so I’m not going to give you any names. But I did speak to Mr. Glahs. In fact, I have an email from him. I could read it out, but in the interests of time, I’m not sure that I will.", "But it gives you some indication of what can happen when a government throws itself in with an organization without considering what the consequences may be. The card-based certification, which we voted against—I’m proud to say that I voted against it when that legislation came up here in I guess it would have been 2004 because I only got here in the fall of 2003. I don’t think it would have been voted on before we left for the Christmas recess. But that’s what can happen. You know the old saying, “Be careful what you wish for”? That was a pretty sad end to a very, very successful business in my riding, in the town of Arnprior.", "I’d have to ask the folks on the other side, was that really the intention of bringing in that card-based certification? I know it put the unions on board for you guys in the 2003 election, because you made that promise, but were you really wanting to put people out of business? Is that what you hoped for? Was that what you expected?", "That’s going to happen a whole lot more. I mean, the IBEW has become extremely aggressive in wanting to ensure that every shop out there is unionized. Well, the one thing it will do if it happens—we want to talk about inflation? I can guarantee you this: That poor pensioner living on an old age widow’s pension in small-town Ontario is not an electrician, and she ain’t going to be able to do it by herself. When she has to hire that electrician and all the shops are controlled by the IBEW, she’s going to pay a lot more than she used to.", "What about that poor lady who lives by herself and barely gets by, wasn’t a member of the workforce herself, widowed, trying to pay her hydro bill? I guess we could talk about that too, couldn’t we?" ],

It strengthens workplace protections for workers and increases fairness for businesses that play by the rules.", "This proposed legislation covers a lot of ground, but at its heart, it is about taking important steps to ensure that every Ontarian gets the paycheque they earned at the end of the day. It also protects our most vulnerable workers from dangerous workplace situations, and it increases competitiveness for businesses who play by the rules.", "Now, removing the $10,000 cap on unpaid wages is an important step.

The IBEW workers in my riding just built a brand new arena—did all the electrical work there. It was built on time. It was built on budget, with not one safety violation, and nobody got hurt. These are very talented workers who provide a great service. Are they compensated? Absolutely, but they do an incredible job.", "We just had the opening there last week: 6,000 people there watching the Niagara IceDogs play. Everybody is proud of what happened there.

This is the same of any bill that affects the lives of working people here in the province of Ontario.", "With that in mind, I’d like to point out that this piece of legislation does do some things that I think are good. They’re good for business and they’re good for workers alike. I think there are measures here that we as New Democrats see as a step in the right direction.", "But the bill also needs to go further. Let’s start with the minimum wage. We’ve spent a lot of time on that this afternoon. I’ve spoken about this before. Bill 18 regulates that every year the minimum wage is set to the rate of inflation and reviewed every five years. This is a step in the right direction and sets out to help working people in the province of Ontario.", "However, I’d like to see more action taken sooner. As many of you know, the number of people over the age of 35 who are working for minimum wage has increased around 10% in the last decade. That doesn’t even begin to touch the young people here in Ontario who are working for minimum wage.", "Those are the kinds of people who would benefit in the future from legislation that brings minimum wage in this province to a standard of living. Regulating it based on inflation is a good thing to combat increased costs of living, and so is reviewing the wage. But more needs to be done, and it needs to be done sooner.", "Coming from Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Fort Erie, where industry is heavily based on the tourist season, we also need a strong, practical plan to implement increasing the minimum wage. We need to make sure small business has the time to assess the wage increases and have their input heard. My riding is full of businesses that would support paying a higher minimum wage, as long as governments make sure that the proper steps are taken to account for it.", "Mr. Speaker, in my riding I heard stories every day from my constituency office, stories from people they call the “working poor”; that is, people who work full-time jobs and still live in poverty. There are people who just want to work hard and live a good life. These are the same people who need the province to take a deeper look at the minimum wage, and quickly.", "The members opposite have concluded that an $11-an-hour wage is good for now. I believe there are reasonable steps, and a plan, that can bring the wage to $12 soon without negatively affecting our local businesses. For the people of Ontario working at minimum wage, that is a big difference.", "A recent report—I think this is important for my colleagues on both sides here to listen to—by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives found that raising the minimum wage does not result in higher rates of unemployment. The economist behind that study encouraged the government to raise the minimum wage. If more people have more purchasing power, it actually means more jobs, not less. I think that’s an important fact. Like I said, this legislation is a step in the right direction, but not quite far enough.", "There are also issues around temporary foreign workers in the province of Ontario. The number of these types of workers is growing, from 91,000 in 2008 to 130,000 today. Many of these workers are subject to long hours and denied many standards that workers from Ontario get. The government needs to make sure that these workers are given the respect they deserve. These are people, too, people who have the right to a safe and fair workplace.", "Making sure we end massive recruitment fees is a good thing. All too often, workers are forced to rely on loans that are too large to manage, just so they can have the right to come here to work. More has to be done for these workers.", "Mr. Speaker, we need to make sure that employers who hire foreign nationals are trustworthy and follow the rules. The government can make sure that the hiring of these workers is regulated and properly done. This will put an end to the unfair fees being imposed on migrant workers, who can’t afford them, and make sure they are properly complaint-processed in case any worker in this province is treated unfairly. The committee reviewing this bill should consider putting it in language that allows foreign nationals working in Ontario to have access to proper channels of immigration and proper social benefits that come from being here in Ontario.", "This bill goes on to address some of the issues that exist around temp agencies—workers who are from right here in Ontario. In my riding of Niagara Falls, people are forced to turn to temporary agencies because they have no other choice. Instead of finding safe, decent and good-paying jobs, they’re forced to take on jobs with companies that only offer temporary work. This is a major problem here.", "We have companies that have a shortage of skilled workers, skilled labour. I spoke with the building trades and the skilled trades recently and they’re all saying the same thing. Airbus Helicopters, which just celebrated their anniversary in Fort Erie, is a great example. They’re a major helicopter manufacturer based in Fort Erie. They provide jobs for the town and the people who live there and they give back to their community.", "They’ve even said they’ve had issues finding workers and people with the right skills to match that plant. If we’ve got young people out of work in the province, we shouldn’t be shuffling them off to temporary work agencies or minimum wage jobs. The province should be supporting them to get an education and the skills they need and give them the support they require to find these highly skilled, good-paying jobs.", "Young people need to be given the support and encouragement to go on to become apprentices. I’m a great example of that. As a young man, I was in shop classes. I was learning skilled trades that gave me the tools that I needed to work in the auto industry. I lasted there for 40 years. Not once did I get hurt. I have all my limbs; I have everything. But it started from taking trades in high school. I used those tools to make a career, a very good one, one that pays good wages, that has got good benefits, that has got a pension plan, and it was all because of the education system we had in the 1970s. I’m showing my age here, but that’s okay. It is what it is.", "I want to see the young people of Ontario have these same chances and opportunities. We’ve got schools in the province that are closing. We can have the debate all day on whether we should be closing our schools in rural Ontario, in Niagara-on-the-Lake. We can have that debate. I can disagree with it. But I can tell you, we could utilize the school spaces to teach our young people trades. Instead of closing the school, utilize that infrastructure that we currently have today in the community and make it the hub of the community again and put trades in those schools and have them learn that, because that’s where the jobs of future are. We can even help schools open by using them for that purpose. It benefits everyone. It benefits the community, it benefits the province, it benefits my kids, it benefits my grandkids. It’s so easy to do; why are we not doing it? If we care about our kids, we should take a serious look at doing that.", "We can’t have our young people being given co-ops and internships where they aren’t safe and they’re not paid. We’re seeing students in this province working incredible hours and not being compensated. What’s even worse is the fact that they’re being exposed to dangerous work without proper training.", "Not too long ago, a 17-year-old co-op student died in Niagara. He was doing his co-op, gaining the skills he needed to get a career, when he was killed on the site. Parents in this province should never have to worry about their children not coming home from a co-op assignment. The province needs to act to make sure our young people, our young workers, our interns, our co-op students are given the support they need. They need to be properly compensated for the work they do, but more importantly, they need to make sure it’s being done safely.", "This bill touches on temporary workers. Right now in this province, 18% of our workforce is considered temporary work. In some places, it’s lower. In places like Brantford, it’s around 21% to 22%. That’s one in five workers, one in five workers who can’t say they have job security. Yes, it’s true that there are major issues with temporary work legislation and we need to address it, but it’s also true we have a jobs crisis.", "The Niagara Falls riding is unfortunately such a case. In a place that was once the industrial heart of Ontario, manufacturing jobs are disappearing. They have left people from Niagara turning to temporary work agencies. There’s a lot the government can do today—today—to fix this problem. They can cut hydro rates and insurance rates for Ontarians and make life more affordable. The province can invest in industry to make Niagara the engine in the growth of the province.", "Mr. Speaker, industry isn’t coming back to Niagara Falls for two reasons: the cost of the dollar that went up and hydro rates. If we bring hydro rates down, we can bring industry back to Niagara. What we’re seeing today is that the dollar is coming down. I talked about the dollar for a long time while I was president of my local union. As the dollar went up to $1, $1.02, and one time it reached $1.10, manufacturers were leaving our province. Today, it’s down to 88 cents. I believe it should probably be somewhere between 84 and 86 cents, which will get manufacturers—if we put the right systems in place, manufacturers will come back and Niagara can grow again, and, more importantly, Ontario will grow again. If we act today, we can put people back into decent and secure jobs.", "There are lots of things I’ve mentioned the province can do to help build Niagara as well." ],

How do we make sure there is a secure, prosperous Ontario?", "When we don’t properly deal with the jobs crisis, we run into offshoot problems, like temporary workers—I believe that’s in the bill as well—and their safety. When they take on these jobs, they’re not greeted with the safety standard that every worker in Ontario deserves. Now, we have some major issues regarding worker safety in this province; there’s no doubt about it. We certainly have issues, major issues, when it comes to temporary workers.", "The issue is simple. We need stronger laws in this province which mandate companies to provide proper education for workers, for our young people. The idea of having a good-paying job can sometimes attract them to dangerous work. We’ve seen time and time again that our young people in this province are incredibly dedicated. They’re talented. They are dedicated. It’s really unbelievable how hard they work. They just need an opportunity. Young people take on these jobs. They’re excited and happy to be working, and after you give them the proper training to make sure they come home safely.", "They aren’t told about proper safety standards or the right to refuse unsafe work. They aren’t trained properly, and they’re thrown right into the deep end. That’s when accidents happen. These are avoidable, but these accidents leave our workers injured, sometimes without limbs, and sometimes they die.", "As my colleagues mentioned yesterday, companies are asking the question—I think this is important—how much would the training cost? The real question they should ask is, how much will it cost when a worker is injured on the job? These employers need to realize that there are major costs when it comes to WSIB and benefits. If the employee gets injured on the job, it is far higher than properly training them in the first place.", "Mr. Speaker, we saw this happen in Kitchener last month. In fact, my fellow member here yesterday from Kitchener–Waterloo is doing a great job to make sure this never happens again. I want to commend her for that. Eighteen workers fell to their deaths last year. That’s 18 families from Ontario whose lives have been shattered because workers aren’t trained properly and they aren’t given proper education. The government has the power to end this by imposing stricter regulations right here in this bill.", "There is more the government can do for these workers. If the government wanted to ensure there was secure and safe employment available in Ontario, why are you making it harder and harder to organize?", "I’ll go to my conclusion so I don’t run out of time.", "There’s nothing in the previous two bills that talks about unionization. Never mind all the other benefits that come with having a stable and secure unionized job; we can drastically improve safety in the workplace if we invest in workers’ rights.", "Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by saying this: This bill is a combination of two previous bills, Bill 146 and Bill 165. I hope that when it comes to committee, the members will remember the criticisms that we have levelled at this particular bill and include them here.

This bill provides them more protection in the workplace: to ensure that there are safe conditions, to ensure that employers are liable for the safety of young people in the workplace. I’m very happy that the member from Niagara Falls recognizes this and supports this.", "I do agree with the member from Niagara Falls that it is not the goal of this government to ensure that there are more minimum wage jobs, but it is the goal of this government to ensure that those people who do have minimum wage jobs have more money to take home to look after themselves and their families, that they have more rights in the workplace to ensure that they get paid the money they are owed and that that workplace will be safer.", "I do look forward to other comments from the member from Niagara Falls and other members about how they can assist our government in making workplaces even safer.

If you’re not big enough at times—you know, you can’t hire somebody to go through all the rules and regulations to see what you want.

It doesn’t solve the poverty problem in our province. It’s good-paying jobs that solve the poverty problem here.", "I think governments have to listen to that.

That means strengthening the workplace and protecting workers, especially those we deem vulnerable, like foreign workers, as well as our young people in co-ops. But at the same time, we also want to make sure that we have fair business practices and that everyone plays by the same rules.", "The proposed legislation, if passed, covers a lot of ground. I’m going to go through different parts of the bill. There are five statutes within the bill that the minister is proposing to amend, and I’m going to go through them so that the audience watching today can understand what we’re trying to do.", "First and foremost, the bill, under schedule 1, talks about the Employment Protection for Foreign Nationals Act. In this particular schedule, the government of Ontario is proposing that foreign workers are protected by the same employment standards—meaning health and safety, and workplace safety insurance—as all other Ontario workers.", "The Stronger Workplaces for a Stronger Economy Act would extend protections for those who are currently live-in caregivers—many of them are foreign workers—to all temporary foreign workers under government work permits.", "Also, all foreign workers would be protected from having their employer withhold or confiscate their passport. I have heard about that. In my riding of Scarborough–Agincourt, we have a significant number of new Canadians, many of them foreign workers here. From time to time, employers will abuse their power and confiscate passports; it’s a power and a control issue.", "The other piece here: Foreign workers will be protected in terms of recruitment fees and other fees. I heard just recently about this particular concern, and I’m very pleased with this whole issue of protecting foreign workers and educating the community.", "I have invited the minister, who will be coming to my riding very shortly to talk about foreign workers, because this is what the concern here right now is: that many foreign workers do not know that they have rights, no different than any Ontarian who is currently working. We need to make sure that their rights are enforced and that they are being informed about their rights.", "The other piece here is that the proposed legislation under schedule 1 of the act would also prohibit a recruiter or employer or person acting on their behalf, usually an agency, from intimidating or penalizing live-in care workers. Again, we hear about those stories, unfortunately, on the front page of newspaper. We need to do better, and I know everybody in this House knows that we have an obligation not just to everyday Ontarians who are currently living permanently in Ontario, but to those foreign workers who are here.", "We also heard recently some of the concerns raised in reports that temporary foreign workers have been underpaid or overworked, denied their rights or not protected when they work over statutory holidays. They should be properly compensated.", "So this is the right thing to do. When we talk about being compassionate as a government and an activist agenda, this is what I’m talking about. I know that every day we have foreign workers in our community.", "The other piece about the temporary workers that we are concerned about is that we are building on our 2009 bill, which prohibits agencies from imposing barriers to prevent clients from hiring assigned employees directly, or charging a fee for things like writing a resumé or even taking a job. Again, in my riding of Scarborough–Agincourt it has happened, such a thing as charging them to assist them because English is their second language. These are unacceptable practices.", "And then the other piece prohibiting clients of an agency from reprisal against any kind of sign that employees were asserting their employment standards rights, among other things—there will be retaliations when they speak out. That’s unacceptable. Each one of us in Ontario should be free when speaking out, when you know that they’re breaking the law. That foreign worker must be protected no differently than any other worker in Ontario, because that’s a responsibility of all of us here in this Legislature.", "The other piece is that the Stronger Workplaces for a Stronger Economy Act would also establish joint and several liability between the temporary help agency and the clients for failure to pay the wages. To give you an example, recently in my riding I heard of a case, very tragic. A worker has been working extensive hours at minimum wage. His employer has not been properly paying him—because he knows that he is a foreign worker—to the tune of almost $10,000. You and I both know, sitting here, “Hm, do they really exist?” I know they exist. I am concerned that employer may potentially declare bankruptcy or do all kinds of interesting deviant behaviours from paying for this particular foreign worker, who has done the work and has not been properly paid.", "The other part of the proposed legislation is better protecting the temps, ensuring the temp agencies that operate above board, which are competing and encouraging employers, are following the letter of the law. So that’s a very good, important thing, Mr. Speaker.", "In schedule 2 of the proposed legislation, it is specifically dealing with the Employment Standards Act. First of all, this particular section of the act would remove the $10,000 cap on the recovery of wages through the Ministry of Labour. Currently, this cap means that if you are owed more than $10,000, you must go to recovery. That money goes through the legal system, which is very costly. We need to fix that, because we know the most vulnerable workers will not see that money if we don’t fix this piece.", "This particular schedule amendment would also allow the workers more time to recover their wages by moving the statutory time limit from six or 12 months to two years. Again, you know vulnerable workers sometimes do not know what their rights are. We know that they may not speak out. Before they file the claims, they leave their jobs, because they’re so afraid of reprisal. By amending the legislation, we’ll provide additional protection of these workers.", "The other piece of the proposed legislative changes would also tie the increase of minimum wage to inflation. I don’t know about you, but during this past election, I consistently heard that we have a duty and responsibility to make sure, when we raised the minimum wage recently, that this minimum wage increase will not come back five years from now, 10 years from now to get another raise. Every day, hard-working Ontarians who are working for minimum wage will have some kind of increase to reflect inflation. Just to give you an example, my colleague who just retired as an MP in Ottawa—his pension is going to increase depending on inflation. Why shouldn’t hard-working Ontarians get the same benefit? When they work hard, they should be respected. We all agree with this premise. But the fact of the matter here is that it has taken a long time for us to even pass the increase on the minimum wage recently. We need to ensure that especially vulnerable people, especially the young people—the pages very soon will be working—will not be stuck at $11 an hour in 2025. This House has a responsibility to especially vulnerable workers.", "The other piece is that the proposed legislation under schedule 2 will require the employers to provide workers with free employment standards posters in 23 languages. I cannot stress enough how important this requirement is. Coming from my riding of Scarborough–Agincourt, there are multiple languages—definitely Chinese, Tamil. There is Hindu and Urdu and a variety. But the key piece is, there is now a new requirement that the Ministry of Labour, if the legislation is passed—that the employer must complete, and post these posters so that the workers know their rights and have the proper information. Oftentimes, the workplace is seen as just a drop-in when the reality is that there is an exchange of employment-employee relationship.", "The other pieces in schedule 2 of the proposed legislation talk about how the Ministry of Labour will require the employer to complete a self-audit of their compliance to help the Ministry of Labour reach more workplaces.", "Again, each one of us, as an MPP, is an employer, and I believe that all of us would have done some self-audit. It’s very important that we do self-compliance. I know, as a former registered nurse, I did what was called a “self-audit” of our professional development. It is very important that every employer across the board do the same.", "The other piece here is that the proposed legislation also gives the Ministry of Labour—cracking down and increasing fines for those who are repeat offenders. We’re not targeting the employers who sometimes make a mistake, but those habitual, repeat offenders—it cannot be seen that just paying the fine is doing the business of the day. Their fine must be significantly increased so that there will be consequences to their actions.", "The other piece here, in schedule 3 of the legislation, deals specifically with the Labour Relations Act. I know the member from Niagara talked about the issue about the unions etc. Mr. Speaker, I’m going to quote the proposed legislation in schedule 3: “The new section 127.3 of the act applies to the construction industry and establishes two-month open periods during which a trade union may apply to the board for certification as bargaining agent of any employees in a bargaining unit.”", "At the end of the day, this part of the schedule also strengthens the Labour Relations Act by returning to the pre-Harris policy of a two-month open period in construction. This will also reduce unnecessary workplace strife, and, furthermore, our trade workers, we need to ensure—we know we respect them—that they focus on building the roads and building the Ontario that we all are very proud of.", "I want to spend the remaining part of my time, Mr. Speaker, focusing on two very important parts of the proposed legislation that are very dear to me as a registered nurse. Schedule 4, dealing with occupational health and safety: This is the section that I believe the minister, when he presented this particular bill to the House—listening to the member from London West, Mr. Speaker. Do you remember that conversation about co-op students, about trainees and unpaid learners?", "The proposed legislation defines very specifically about protection, making sure that there will be coverage under the Occupational Health and Safety Act to co-op students who are not receiving pay, so that they will have the same rights as all Ontario workers—making sure that the youngest citizens who are currently in training are being protected under the Occupational Health and Safety Act.", "Our rules are going to be strengthened, but no matter what your job title is, whether you’re a co-op student, the president or CEO of the company, you are going to adhere to the legislation. If you perform work for somebody, you’re entitled to the same employment standards, the same type of health and safety protections—even those who earn minimum wage.", "There are also two narrow exemptions of this proposed legislation which apply to co-op students and other unpaid learners or trainees. For example, as a former nursing professor, I know that every day when I was teaching, I was bringing nursing students in long-term care, in nursing homes, in the hospital, in the community environment. These nursing students now will be protected under the proposed legislation. Every day across Ontario, from the community colleges to universities and career colleges, our young people are doing these kinds of on-the-job training. The proposed legislation will be protecting them, no differently than anybody who is currently working on a work site.", "Especially right now, with the Ebola conversation we had this morning during question period, when I asked the Minister of Health about this particular issue, students—nursing students and medical students—on any kind of training may be exposed to potential viruses. I was involved during the SARS time in 2003, and I know that students everywhere who are training could be exposed to this kind of environment. This is a very important piece of proposed legislation. Even if you’re paid, legally—unpaid, in the case of the co-op students or students who are in training—you will be protected under the same kind of rules as everyone else.", "The final section of the legislation is schedule 5, dealing with the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act. In the proposed legislation, it is very clearly defined—any time there is a challenge of legislation, it goes back to the definition. In the proposed legislation—I’m going to take a minute, Mr. Speaker, to talk about that—it actually explicitly spells out what is a temporary help agency:", "‘“Temporary help agency’ means an employer referred to in section 72 who primarily engages in the business of lending or hiring out the services of its workers to other employers on a temporary basis for a fee.”", "This is very important. If there is a challenge to the proposed act when the legislation has been passed by the House, they will challenge it because the legislation does not explicitly spell out and define the term “temporary help agency” or “temporary help agency worker.” So in the proposed schedule 5 of the legislation, it spells it all out so that there will be no grey zone. It will be very black, very explicit, so that there will be no confusion whether you are a temporary help agency or not.", "More importantly, the act, if passed, will provide protection to the most vulnerable. As I’m wrapping up my time, my 20 minutes of remarks, I cannot stress enough how important this proposed legislation is to protect every Ontarian, regardless of whether you are a permanent employee, a permanent Ontarian working here in Ontario, or one of those who are considered foreign workers—and, more importantly, our young people. I heard passionately from our colleague from London West when she presented her private member’s bill last session; I know my colleagues opposite in the third party will know what I’m talking about. I agree with her proposed private member’s bill.", "I believe that the minister also heard you—and the member from London West will know what I’m talking about—because, at the end of the day, the proposed legislation is not just targeting those who are permanent Ontario workers, but that everybody who works in an environment, whether they are paid or unpaid, is being protected. This government has an agenda to ensure that every worker in Ontario is being protected. I believe that the minister, Minister Flynn, is very, very concerned about every worker in Ontario, because, at the end of the day, when one worker is injured or killed in the line of work, every Ontario family suffers.", "Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity." ],

This young man, Aaron Murray, was doing the work of a security guard. He was essentially displacing an employee who should have been paid. There was no real, substantive learning component in the placement he was doing in this unpaid practicum as a security guard. This was not a quality learning opportunity for this student. Yes, it’s absolutely essential that there be health and safety protections for all young people, all persons doing work placements, whether they’re paid or unpaid.

But because all these things are put into one bill, it’s very difficult to debate and to vote against this bill because there’s some things that we like about it, but there’s some things that we think should be changed in this bill.", "One has to do with the WSIB and the business of hiring somebody through a temporary agency—you work along with these people, and then all of a sudden, they find out that the temp agency isn’t paying its employees or something, and you get nailed, maybe with their WSIB costs, which you weren’t expecting. How is that other business supposed to charge a customer for that extra cost which he or she thought was being paid by the temp agency? There’s issues like that, I think, that have to be looked at.", "Also, when we were going through this, my colleague from Lambton–Kent–Middlesex pointed out that a lot of these stakeholders had not been consulted on this bill. This comes as a complete surprise to many of them." ],

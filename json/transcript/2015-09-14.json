The Queen has carried out her responsibilities with grace, dignity and intelligence, earning respect and admiration across the Commonwealth and around the world.", "Canadians have shown their great esteem and affecttion for Her Majesty during her many visits to our country. She has made Canada a priority in her international travel, travelling here more times than to any other country. And she has been a frequent and welcome visitor to Ontario, making 14 visits to our province since 1951. Wonderful.", "During these visits, the Queen has shown a preference for participating in events that celebrate selfless service to others. In 1973, she attended the first-ever Ontario Medal for Good Citizenship. During her most recent visit to Canada in 2010, she joined Premier McGuinty here at Queen’s Park for a celebration of service honouring outstanding achievements in volunteerism and other forms of giving back to society.", "The most visible elements of the Queen’s visits are royal walkabouts, when she meets and mingles with members of the public. These walkabouts began spontaneously during the 1939 royal tour of Canada by Her Majesty’s parents after they had dedicated the National War Memorial in Ottawa. The royal couple surprised and delighted the vast crowd when, instead of turning to their motorcade, they spent half an hour mingling with veterans of the First World War.", "During her reign, Queen Elizabeth has institutionalized walkabouts, developing them into a much-loved tradition. I am speaking about walkabouts today because of their symbolic importance. Earlier generations typically perceived a king or a queen as a remote figurehead, but the advent of walkabouts has helped to forge a connection between the monarch and her people and has reflected the democratic spirit of our age. Yet at the same time, they strike a careful balance by also respecting the dignity that is integral to the high office the Queen holds.", "Her Majesty has done an exemplary job of maintaining the monarchy, which is one of the pillars of our democracy. By doing so, she has helped to sustain the combination of parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy that we’re so fortunate to live under. Our system of government, which has evolved over many centuries, has allowed Canada to become a vibrant and stable democracy and one of the world’s most successful nations. It ensures that the power of the state is not absolute; that peace, order and good government endure; and that, as citizens, we can take control of our destiny and live without fear of tyranny.", "The Queen has steered a steady course for more than 63 years. She has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to public service, and she has upheld the monarchy as a symbol of stability and continuity.", "La reine a maintenu le cap depuis plus de 63 ans. Elle a fait preuve d’un engagement indéfectible envers le service public et elle a fait de la monarchie un symbole de stabilité et de continuité.", "Her poise, strength and integrity have offered the people of Canada and the 15 other Commonwealth countries where she is the head of state a source of reassurance and stability in a time of unprecedented change.", "On behalf of the government of Ontario, I want to congratulate the Queen for achieving this significant milestone, and I want to thank Her Majesty for her lifetime of dedicated service to the people of our province and our country, and to wish her many more years in her remarkable reign.", "God save the Queen." ],

Along with the people of Ontario and our Progressive Conservative caucus, I express my deep and profound appreciation for Her Majesty’s devotion of so much of her life to public service and the greater good.", "It’s next to impossible to put into perspective the sheer length of her service and dedication to her kingdom, but just to try, when she was crowned in 1953, Leslie Frost was Premier of Ontario and the very first colour television sets went on sale. When I was born, Her Majesty had already been serving as head of state for 25 years, and she has since served with dedication and distinction. It is my hope that we can all follow her lead and example of integrity.", "Her Majesty the Queen has been the head of our country through some of our nation’s most iconic and momentous occasions. It was Her Majesty, through the Governor General, who granted royal assent to Prime Minister Diefenbaker’s Bill of Rights, finally passing into law some of our most inalienable rights: freedom of speech, equality, and the right to life and liberty. Twenty-two years later, it was Her Majesty who personally signed the Constitution Act on Parliament Hill—bringing the Constitution to Canada, finally granting our country complete sovereignty.", "During her reign as Queen of Canada, she has travelled internationally as head of state and visited our country 24 times on royal tours. It was during one of these state visits, in 2010, that I had the pleasure and honour of taking my father—who was born in London, England, during the Second World War and moved to Canada when Her Majesty was beginning her reign—to meet her. My father often recounts how, when the Second World War ended, his parents were among the thousands who gathered outside of Buckingham Palace awaiting the royal family, including then-Princess Elizabeth, and how the strength and leadership shown by King George VI and the Queen Mother brought light to the world during a very dark time. How fitting, then, that for almost 64 years, Her Majesty has served as the enduring symbol of freedom and democracy.", "While we as politicians sometimes carry on with partisan banter, Her Majesty and the principles she represents remain above it all. She is above politics and partisanship. She stands as a symbol of security and unwavering leadership. She stands as a reminder for all of us not just of our past but to our future. Her Majesty brings great pride to the Commonwealth.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to stand here on my first day in the Ontario Legislature to honour Her Majesty, a remarkable and inspirational leader.

She has worked with 12 British Prime Ministers and 11 Canadian Prime Ministers, and as the living embodiment of the crown in Canada, she has been a proud and stoic figure. Through ever-changing times, she has ruled with equanimity and dignity and she has remained above the fray of politics.", "There is no doubt that Canadians remain fascinated by the Queen and her royal family. On each of Her Majesty’s 22 visits to Canada, thousands of Canadians flocked to catch a glimpse of the Queen. There is no doubt that Canada’s monarchy continues to hold a special place in the hearts and minds of Canadians.", "In fact, I can remember her in Hamilton in the year of the Queen’s Golden Jubilee in October 2002, when she presented the new colours to her Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise’s). At that time, she noted the regiment’s gift to the community in my riding of a commemorative pavilion in Bayfront Park, to remember those who served and especially those who gave their lives. It is also notable that Queen Elizabeth was not only quick to write to the family and regiment to share her grief and sorrow at the tragic shooting of Corporal Cirillo, but several months later, held an audience with members of his Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders regiment, including Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence Hatfield, Lieutenant Colonel Rick Kennedy and Honorary Colonel Ron Foxcroft.", "Since her youngest days, the Queen has made it clear that her role is one of service to her people, and so I’ll close with a very short and succinct quote by Her Royal Majesty: “There is a motto which has been borne by many of my ancestors—a noble motto, ‘I serve.’” I think that should be an important reminder for all of us who represent the people of Ontario, for all of us who are privileged to stand in this place. We would do well to follow the example of Her Majesty who, at the age of 89, still holds more than 400 public engagements each and every year. In fact, the Premier talked about her walkabouts. Personally, I have to say that I love her dogs. Every time I see a corgi, I think of Her Majesty, and I think many people are of the same opinion.", "We would always do well, in fact, to follow Her Royal Majesty’s example and remember that public life should be a life of service to the people, and that public service truly is a noble cause.", "On behalf of the Ontario NDP caucus, I wish Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II good health and long life in the continuation of her service to the people of the United Kingdom, Canada and beyond.", "God save the Queen." ],

Bill 73 is also known as the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act.", "During my remarks, I’m going to be reinforcing some of the points that were made by my colleague the member for Windsor–Tecumseh when he spoke to the bill in his capacity as NDP critic for municipal affairs and housing. He gave that one-hour speech just before the Legislature rose for the summer.", "Over the course of that speech, he spent a fair bit of time focusing on two issues that are of particular concern to those of us on this side of the House who are members of the NDP caucus. Those issues specifically are inclusionary zoning and Ontario Municipal Board reform.", "As I have stated before, when I have participated in debates in this Legislature, I come from a policy background. Prior to my election, I was a policy researcher, so I like to focus on those aspects of legislation that respond to what the evidence tells us—what we know from data and from experience about the actual problems that exist—and also what we know from other jurisdictions and from best practice about the best solutions to address these problems.", "From that perspective, I would say, and members of my caucus would agree, that Bill 73 gets a passing grade. It does identify that a lack of transparency in the planning process has hindered the ability of citizens to participate in building their communities and that OMB appeals have undermined municipal official plans that are developed and passed with strong community support when a developer challenges the OMB immediately following the passage of the plan. Nevertheless, Bill 73 is far from the OMB reform bill that the government has been promising since 2003 and which Ontarians have long demanded.", "In addition, while Bill 73 amends the Development Charges Act to allow municipalities to recover more of the costs associated with new transit projects, it could have gone much further to enable municipal government to fully recover growth-related capital costs—in other words, to really ensure that growth pays for growth.", "Despite more than a year and a half of public consultations on this bill, consultations that began in the fall of 2013, Bill 73 does relatively little to address some of the most pressing problems in land use planning. As my colleague the member for Windsor–Tecumseh said, many Ontarians were hoping that this bill would go much further than it does. They were hoping that Bill 73 would implement inclusionary zoning to address the chronic shortage of affordable housing across the province. They were also hoping that it would put some real checks on the extraordinary power of the OMB to override the express wishes of Ontario municipalities. Unfortunately, these issues are not addressed in the bill.", "But before I go into more detail about these missed opportunities, I want to highlight some of the provisions that are included in the bill and which do improve some of the issues that we have seen in the planning process.", "The first part of Bill 73 proposes a series of amendments to the Development Charges Act, 1997. It removes the current mandatory 10% discount that must be applied to transit-related growth costs in the determination of DCs. It allows the Lieutenant Governor in Council to prescribe municipal services whose DC recovery costs can be estimated based on planned levels of future service rather than historical past levels, which could help municipalities undertake transit expansion or build new recreational facilities etc. It also imposes additional reporting requirements on how development charges are collected and spent to ensure greater transparency in the DC process.", "The second part of Bill 73 amends the Planning Act. It places a two-year moratorium on amendment applications from developers following the adoption of a new official plan or zoning bylaw—and this is what I had referred to earlier. Previously, we had seen developers applying for amendments following the adoption of an official plan—an official plan that had been developed by means of an extensive consultation process. This allows the official plan to be in place for at least two years before an amendment can be applied for.", "Bill 73 also prohibits global appeals of new official plans and allows appeals only if they are connected to specific issues with a plan. It makes planning decisions more transparent by requiring approval authorities to explain how written or oral submissions that were received during the planning consultation process affected the final decision. It changes the time frame for a developer planning appeals to the OMB by effectively stopping the clock if parties wish to pursue alternative dispute resolution. The clock restarts on the time frame for appeals once the ADR process is completed.", "The bill requires municipalities to create planning advisory committees, or PACs, which must include at least one resident of the municipality who is not on council and not a city employee. This will require some municipalities, like my community of London, to shift planning responsibility from where it currently resides within a standing committee of council, to a PAC committee instead.", "The bill allows municipalities to request a 90-day extension of the current 180-day deadline to make a decision with respect to an official plan or an official plan amendment. It requires a comprehensive review of new official plans 10 years after they first come into effect instead of the current five years, but it then requires updates every five years thereafter. Similarly, it also changes the timeline for provincial policy statements so that the PPSs have to be updated every 10 years instead of the current five.", "The bill requires municipalities to have a parks plan in order to collect cash in lieu of parkland dedication, but reduces parkland dedication payments from a rate of one hectare for every 300 residents to one hectare for every 500 residents.", "Speaker, some of these amendments are certainly welcome and long overdue. For example, allowing municipalities to base development charges on planned future levels of service, instead of historical average levels, and removing transit from the arbitrary 10% DC reduction could provide a much-needed revenue stream for municipal transit projects.", "This is of particular significance for my community of London. We are projecting a population increase of 77,000 people by 2035 and have been moving ahead with an ambitious rapid transit initiative called Shift London, which, of course, will require significant investment in transit vehicles and infrastructure.", "Speaker, New Democrats are certainly supportive of these provisions. We are also supportive of the amendments in the act that increase the authority of municipal governments to make decisions on local matters and that reduce the impact of appeals. As I mentioned, placing a two-year moratorium on appeals to the official plan is a significant step forward, given the comprehensive process that is involved in developing and adopting a new official plan.", "I do want to say with some pride that in my community, London’s new draft official plan involved the most extensive process of civic engagement that has ever been undertaken by any Canadian municipality. That plan is still in draft form. It has yet to be approved by council, but once it is adopted, the extensive consultation process that went into its making should be respected.", "In fact, it’s the provisions of Bill 73 related to the process of adopting the official plan that will have the biggest impact on my community of London, as well as other communities that are at a similar stage, because we haven’t yet adopted the official plan. For that reason, council is considering delaying approval of the London plan until these amendments that are included in Bill 73 are in place.", "With regard to the proposed DC amendments, London’s main concern is to maximize flexibility for local councils to set their own policies and to use DCs to fully recover growth-related capital costs. The city has identified four specific areas related to DCs that they would like to see amended before the legislation is finalized: area ratings, mandatory reductions, ineligible services and OMB appeals.", "Currently, municipal councils are able to determine if certain services and/or areas should have differential DC rates. Bill 73 states that regulations may require councils to use differential DC bylaws for different parts of their municipalities, which would really limit the policy-making authority of councils. It will be important that the new regulation respect council’s ability to determine their own DC bylaws according to local needs and circumstances.", "Second, although transit is being removed from the mandatory 10% reduction for soft services, other services such as parks, recreation facilities and libraries are still considered ineligible for DCs. This limits the ability of councils to fund legitimate growth costs and increases the cost for local taxpayers. In London’s 2014 DC study, the 10% reduction to these services meant that approximately $5.3 million of growth costs could not be recovered.", "Third, the DC Act outlines a number of ineligible services that cannot be funded from development charges, ranging from museums, theatres, art galleries, tourism facilities, parkland acquisition, municipal administrative buildings and waste management. I understand that waste diversion is being considered under Bill 73 as eligible for DC recovery and this is certainly another change that is long overdue. However, many would argue that there should be no ineligible services, that the principal of growth paying for growth should make all growth-related services eligible for DC funding. The Urban League of London, in its input to the bill, pointed out that removing the discount for municipal buildings could actually incentivize municipal governments to build to LEED standards, which would, in the long run, save money on energy and is just better for the environment.", "From our perspective in the NDP caucus, the most troubling omission from Bill 73 is around the issue of inclusionary zoning. This has long been identified as a planning priority by the NDP. In particular, I want to acknowledge my colleague the member for Parkdale–High Park, who has shown considerable leadership on this issue by introducing a private member’s bill. We also know that many Liberals also support inclusionary zoning. We saw a private member’s bill from the member for Etobicoke–Lakeshore which includes a lot of regulation around inclusionary zoning. That PMB would make it mandatory, in fact, that developers make new units available to people who require affordable housing. This is definitely a direction we would like to go in, and we have some questions about why that private member’s bill was not included in this government act.", "We know that there is a crisis in affordable housing across the province. The latest report from the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association, the 2015 Waiting Lists Survey, shows that 3,643 more Ontario households are waiting for rent-geared-to-income housing, compared to 2014. For the second year in a row, the average wait to get housing in Ontario was almost four years.", "In my community in London, we are a bit better off than other parts of the province; our average wait time is only 1.56 years, and there was a slight decrease over the last year in the number of families waiting for affordable housing. But the number of singles and couples with no children on the wait-list jumped 18% between 2013 and 2014. The reality is that rent remains too high for many single people or childless couples who are looking for small units in London. If you are on Ontario Works, there are few, if any, apartments that are available within the housing allowance of $375. If you’re working at a minimum wage job in London, you will be hard-pressed to find an apartment that you can afford when market rent for a bachelor apartment is about $586, and it’s $767 for a one-bedroom apartment.", "So inclusionary zoning would have been a critical tool to help municipalities like London and other communities across the province to increase the stock of affordable housing, particularly, in our case, in London, of affordable one-bedroom units, which could help ease the pressure we are experiencing.", "In London, as my colleague the member for London–Fanshawe and I have also spoken about in this House, we are tragically familiar with the consequences of not providing access to affordable housing, particularly for people who are vulnerable. It forces people who want to leave shelters to move into substandard housing, such as rooming houses or unregulated group homes and puts them at significant risk.", "Last fall in London, we learned of the death of David MacPherson, a 72-year-old man who died in a house fire in an unregulated group home, a fire that also left two dozen other people homeless. Later in December, a man was burned out of a room he was staying in at a low-rent motel in London. Earlier this year in London, a windstorm ripped off the roof—the total roof was blown away—of a substandard walk-up apartment building. Again, almost a dozen low-income tenants were left homeless. So inclusionary zoning, as I have said, would go a long way to help increase the stock of affordable housing.", "As I indicated, there are some references to the OMB that are included in Bill 73, but in our view, it completely misses the boat on OMB reform. Many citizens in communities across Ontario have learned the hard way that the OMB holds really extraordinary powers, even to the extent of being allowed to make up its own rules.", "This is an issue that has been raised numerous times in this place by my colleague the member for Kitchener–Waterloo. In her community, the OMB overturned an official plan that was 10 years in the making, a plan that was designed to curb urban sprawl and promote transit-friendly compact development. It was endorsed by local politicians, embraced by the community, approved by the province, but following a developer’s appeal to the OMB, it was overturned. It was replaced with sprawling development that is much more extensive than anyone in the region had contemplated, which is leading to a significant loss of farmland, a reduction of green space and increased threats to the groundwater. Not only did the OMB’s ruling show complete disregard for the community planning process, it also totally ignored the provincial government’s Places to Grow Act.", "Overall, New Democrats support this bill. We’ll be voting to move it to committee because we do feel that it deserves to have public input, but we will be listening carefully to the amendments that are brought forward by municipalities like the city of London and we will be interested in hearing the views of all Ontarians who have an interest and a stake in decisions about land use planning. As I have indicated, we will certainly be looking to introduce our own amendments related to OMB reform and inclusionary zoning.", "Thank you very much, Speaker, for this opportunity.

Of course, we heard the results: The government was just flat out no; they weren’t going to touch it. So when we say that the government is interested in working with AMO and the municipalities in Ontario, we’re somewhat suspect on that, and we are concerned that this legislation is happening before all consultation is done.", "As part of the minister’s mandate letter, he was tasked with conducting a full review of the Ontario Municipal Board, but this bill tables a number of changes to the board before the review is conducted. I would hope that the government listens to the municipalities in this province and does conduct more hearings and better hearings than they’ve been doing already.

It didn’t matter that the town had engaged in a meaningful consultation process, and that they worked on it for a period of 10 years. They submitted their plan, and then a developer came along, went straight to the OMB and it’s like none of that work ever happened, none of that work ever mattered. That has brought problems to the people in London, and certainly the member was good at explaining what happened.", "All this is to say that we agree that the Planning Act needs to change.

I have, since 2007, an incredible privilege of representing my community of Ottawa Centre. Those of you who have had the opportunity to be in my riding—and I hope that’s every single member in the House, because I have the most rare and unique opportunity of representing downtown Ottawa in our nation’s capital, with national institutions like the House of Commons, the Senate of Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada, the Bank of Canada, and many national museums, something that everyone should come and visit.", "I’ve had the amazing opportunity to work with my community on some very important issues as we work together to grow our community and make it even more livable and healthy for all members of our community. One of the issues, Speaker, that I’ve been quite actively working on with my community since, I would say, 2009 or so is the issue around land use planning, the issue around development in our community and the challenges, at times, that come up with that development if it is not done right.", "My community, given that it is a downtown community, is home to many desirable neighbourhoods that are sought after across the city. I would say, with all due respect to all the members from the Ottawa area, you will see neighbourhoods like the Glebe, or Westboro, Hintonburg, Carleton Heights, Centretown, Carlington, Mechanicsville—all these neighbourhoods, Speaker, are absolutely just growing. They’re growing with young families moving in, buying their first home. They are growing with a lot of what we colloquially call empty nesters: couples whose kids have grown up and have now gone to university or have their own homes or jobs, who are downsizing, coming into downtown and perhaps moving into condominiums. That’s another big development you’ll see in my community: vertical neighbourhoods, as I often call them, with condominium buildings being developed.", "But with that intensification, which is very much welcomed in my community, come challenges around how that development is taking place, to what extent the community is engaged and involved in that development, and how we are working together to ensure that the development that is taking place in our community is being done in a manner that keeps the fabric and the character of our neighbourhoods. That’s one of the things my constituents often talk about: making sure the development we are having really maintains that fabric, that tradition, the values of our neighbourhoods, because the neighbourhoods in my community go back over 150 years, since the building of the Rideau Canal and Bytown, and of course the development that took place that is now the city of Ottawa.", "As a result of that tension, at times, I’ve been quite engaged with my community in working along with them in developing the next steps to ensure that the process of development and the process around land use planning is one that brings everybody together—brings the developers and the community and the municipality together—so that we can work together in creating what we refer to in my community as community-inspired development, where everybody is working together so that the intensification that is taking place is something we can all enjoy and live with.", "As a result of many conversations and meetings and consultations with our community associations and with neighbours and friends in my riding, in the election of 2011, I came up with a very concrete proposal as to how we can have community-inspired development. There were four things that I proposed on behalf of the community—and I committed to the community that if I’m elected, I will work on those things—that I wanted to very quickly highlight.", "One was to change the Planning Act to require municipalities to adopt completed community design plans into their official plans—that’s something that our communities spend a lot of time developing, these CDPs, or community design plans—to make sure they actually become part of official plans as sort of secondary plans, so that everybody has the predictability and certainty around what has been decided as a community. That includes developers as well.", "Another proposal that I had put forward as part of our community-inspired development proposal was that we ensure decisions of the city council around official plans are respected by the OMB. Many times, communities feel that the OMB overrules those decisions and elected representatives in city council sometimes lose their voice.", "Thirdly, that we impose mandatory mediation in all development appeals, as opposed to the adversarial process that exists; and lastly, introduce anti-SLAPP legislation to protect the participation of individuals and community groups advocating or speaking out on these and other issues.", "Since my re-election in 2011, I’ve been very actively working on all those four aspects, and I’m really happy to see that Bill 73 adopts many of those suggestions that my community and I made in that process.", "As for the anti-SLAPP bill, I took the step of introducing Bill 132 in October 2012, as a private member’s bill, to have the legislation around strategic litigation against public participation. I’m very excited to know that the voice and the will of my community, expressed through Bill 132, was then adopted by the government, by means of Bill 52, which is being debated in this House as well. I am hopeful that it will become law in this session through the support of all members in the House.", "But the other three elements have been something that we’ve been discussing and I’ve been advocating to the community. As a result, in 2012, I hosted a community consultation, something that I do—it’s called a sustainable community summit—where we take different topics that are important to our downtown urban needs. We had over 100 people come to that consultation with some excellent presentations as to how we can reform our land use planning system.", "We had presentations—and I do want to mention these individuals, because they’re very active in my community—from people like Jay Baltz of the Hintonburg Community Association, who had done extensive work on the OMB process and was actually also part of the adjustment committee at the city as well. We had January Cohen, who is a development lawyer with Soloway Wright LLP, who brought the practitioner’s own perspective into the conversation. We also had a developer, Neil Malhotra, who is the vice-president of Claridge Homes, who very candidly offered development’s point of view as to the planning that goes on on behalf of developers when they are proposing projects.", "That robust conversation resulted in a report that we tabled to the then Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing—the current Premier of Ontario—to sort of undertake, where we very candidly canvassed issues like these: Should we just maintain the status quo? Should we create local appeal boards, as opposed to OMBs, to look at decisions? Should we enhance community-inspired development, something that I had proposed and we see reflected in Bill 73? Should we dissolve the OMB?", "I have to tell you that the overwhelming response by the members of my community was, number one, against maintaining the status quo, because they felt that something is broken and needs to be fixed, and against dissolving the OMB. They felt that the OMB has an important role as a quasi-judicial tribunal, an arm’s-length body which is not government. It’s a court-like body with expertise. Rules maybe have to be looked at, but it’s important to keep that body in place. But really, it was sort of focusing on, what we need is more community-based development. We need more community voices in that development process.", "Let me just highlight and share with you, Speaker, a couple of things that my community said, which we noted in our report. Minister, if you want a refresher copy of the report, I would be more than happy to share it with you again as well." ],

The problem is at the level of the city’s official plan zoning and a commitment to working with the official plan zoning.", "Another participant said, in that consultation, that it’s not about the OMB but about how communities and citizens are able to communicate perspectives and valuable opinions into the official plan and CDPs.", "Those are just two examples where people very strongly talked about how we can improve the system by making sure that community voices are present at the discussion when a proposal is put forward by a developer and then that proposal works through the system to the city level.", "I’m of the view, Speaker, that if we can have a better conversation, if we have better feedback at the initial stage, you will eliminate the majority of OMB appeals right from the get-go. The reason OMB appeals take place is because something got broken at the front end, where people were not talking, where projects were being rammed through, either through the developer or at the city council. Somebody is unhappy, and that unhappiness then reflects in the appeal process.", "That is why I am so excited about Bill 73: because this is exactly what this bill achieves to do. It makes the citizen engagement piece an integral part, a mandated part, through legislation, from the moment a proposal is put forward and then all the way to the OMB process, if you get that far.", "The fact that we are now requiring city councils or city planners to have citizen engagement as part of the official plan, I think, speaks to the community-inspired development. This bill requires that developers must consult with the communities when they put forward a proposal and then shall—the language is mandatory—respond to that and reflect changes accordingly.", "The fact that we now require that the city council or city planning committee also consider community feedback and make sure that the developer actually responds to that is an important step—then reporting back on that, then taking that thread further if the matter does go to the OMB, making sure that the OMB also gives regard to that process. I think that’s a very sensible move and something that has been appreciated in my community.", "In fact, Speaker, I will say to you that since we have tabled this legislation, many communities and developers are now working together and already starting to do that, because they realize—hopefully this bill will be passed with the permission of all the members—that this is the right thing to do. We’re starting to see development take place in the community where—in the past, people did not speak to each other; the community did not speak with the developers or vice versa—they are actually walking hand in hand because they are talking to each other and they are influencing each other.", "I’ll give you the example of Old Ottawa East, also a neighbourhood in my community, where a whole new development is starting to take place on Oblate lands. It was church land. It was a beautiful green place with heritage buildings. The church had to sell the building, but the city made sure that they engaged in a community design plan that was very consultative in nature. The developers who bought the land made sure that they worked with the local community association.", "I’ll never forget that photo that got published in the Ottawa Citizen—half a page—where the developers and the members of the community association were, all four, walking through this piece of land arm in arm. That’s what the photo was. We never used to see that, but the reason we were able to see that is because they all worked together. They were able to influence the development as a community. The developers were able to respond to the needs of the community. What we will have is a more community-inspired development, a wholesome community that will be developed and intensified because this was green space that was being developed by the Rideau River—it’s a beautiful piece of land—in a manner that reflects the views of the community.", "This leads me to the second point, which is very important in Bill 73 and something that my community raised as part of a proposal around sustainable community development: We need more certainty also from our city councils. When communities work extremely hard through their community design plan process, that needs to get enshrined in the official plan; that has to become an effective, mandatory part of our CDPs.", "Where you get challenges—and I can tell you some really not-so-pleasant experiences in my community, where, for two or three years, the community worked together in the Westboro and in the Wellington West neighbourhoods in my community, where we’ve seen a lot of intensification. They worked together in developing those CDPs, and those CDPs then were ignored as developers came forward and put proposals forward. I won’t blame the developers for that. I would say that the city should have done a better job in saying, “No, no, no. The CDP says nine storeys, not 35 storeys, and we will hold your account to nine storeys only.”", "The solution to that is that, once CDPs are developed with broad consultation, we should make them part of the official plan. This bill does that through the community design permit system. It really asks that we bring that certainty and predictability. When communities work together in developing a community design plan for a neighbourhood, through this permit system that is allowed for in Bill 73, it becomes part of the official plan as a secondary plan, and the municipality then updates their zoning bylaw to reflect that change that has been established through the community design planning permit. That one change will go such a long way, because it’s like posting a speed limit. When you say, “You shall drive at 50 kilometres an hour,” then that’s the speed limit and you can’t go through the speed limit. If you do, there are consequences. That provides predictability for the communities and for the developers, because then they can plan accordingly. I’ll guarantee you, Speaker, that you will see a big reduction in the number of OMB appeals as a result of that.", "Let me just very quickly, Speaker, given my time, also talk to you about another important aspect of this bill, and that is around the predictability of 10-year official plans. I think that’s an important step, to make sure that there’s incentive for municipalities to create official plans. We see a lot of municipalities which don’t renew their official plans accordingly, as prescribed in the Planning Act, and I think that a longer time frame gives them that perspective. Having a two-year freeze in that timeline helps as well. The city of Ottawa has been very good in that regard, in terms of renewing their official plans. But that is an important aspect.", "The last point is around development charges, and the predictability, transparency and accountability that is being proposed. I will speak in relation to public transit, which is very important to my community in Ottawa Centre.", "These changes are welcome changes. This is something that my mayor, Jim Watson, who is a former member of this Legislature, has been asking for. I believe that Waterloo has also sought the same type of changes. Those communities where we’ve not had systems like the light rail transit system we’re building in Ottawa, which runs through my community in Ottawa Centre—the current model of calculating development charges on historical 10-year data does not work. That historical 10-year data does not exist, because we’ve not had that mode of transportation. That’s not the case, for example, in the city of Toronto, which has had a multi-modal transit system for some while. So the change that is being proposed that will allow for a more prospective way of calculating development charges is a welcome change, because it will allow for our municipalities to be able to take those development charges and be able to invest in further public transit as well.", "There may be some disagreement, I understand, between the development community and what municipalities are asking for. I know the minister and his staff are doing a very good job to bring everybody together and get some peace in the valley, as they say. But I think, at the end of the day, it’s a step in the right direction to ensure that we encourage communities like mine in Ottawa and Waterloo to actually take development of public transit and be able to attract more of what we call “transit-induced development.” We want more and more people living closer to public transit so that they are not relying on driving their cars too often, and it will result in better planning and better neighbourhoods.", "Speaker, my time is up. I just wanted to say that I’m very excited that this bill is going forward. I encourage all members to vote in support of this bill, something it is supported very wholeheartedly in my community. We also look forward to working with the minister on his consultation on OMB reform, because that is important work as well. But this is a very good step in the right direction." ],

Part of that review, I believe, was supposed to be the greenbelt, the Niagara Escarpment, the Oak Ridges moraine and the actual OMB, but now they’ve brought legislation ahead of the supposed conversation or consultation.", "At the risk of sounding a bit cynical, I recall in my three and a half years here a lot of discussion about the Green Energy Act, where they actually took away that ability for a local municipality to have a say in the sustainable growth of their community. So I find it a bit challenging to believe that they’re going to make this legislation work better than the Green Energy Act when they’ve already superseded their own conversation and consultation in regard to something that’s going to have a significant impact on all of our municipalities, Mr. Speaker.", "At the end of the day, we need to ensure that our communities have sustainable growth. We’ve asked them, for at least the last two years—one of the most significant pieces of legislation is our hydro pricing. That’s driving people out of our communities, out of our province and out of our country, to be absolutely frank. At the end of the day, I would hope that they’ll also address that portion of their mandate to ensure that we actually have rates that people can afford. We definitely need balance; we need a balance for our Development Charges Act.", "There are a lot of pieces in here.

  "text" : [ "Good afternoon, everybody. I think it is hitting home that our proceedings have commenced. I actually thought it was quite appropriate to commence this session of the Legislature with the unanimous consent motion recognizing the fact that Her Majesty is part of this legislation that we are debating, acknowledging in this first session and all sessions of this Legislature that debate is conducted under the auspices of the Queen. It’s entrenched in our constitution: Her Majesty is at once a human being but also an incarnation of this process. The institution within Ontario—within Canada—provides with us the authority to do what we are doing this afternoon, whether we are a federal member, a provincial member and, I would assume, by extension through the provincial government, municipal members.", "Quite honestly, I’ve never been a municipal councillor. I don’t know whether municipally elected representatives swear allegiance to the Queen. That’s a question I might put out for somebody who may have an answer. But we’re not allowed to set foot in this chamber without swearing an oath of allegiance to the Queen. In this bill itself, Bill 73, the first two words of this legislation, if you open it up, are “Her Majesty,” and it continues from there.", "So, through this legislation, under the auspices of a politically neutral monarch who personifies the Canadian state, ensuring that those of us who are elected, those of us conducting business this afternoon—and I would assume municipal councillors as well—remember that the power is only loaned us to by the crown on behalf of voters.", "I know there has been considerable discussion this afternoon about whether the public engagement, the citizen participation, with respect to this legislation was adequate. It’s not complete. Quite honestly, I don’t know. I am assuming there will be hearings when we finish second reading. But our job, under the authority of the Queen, is to come up with the best law possible. Indirectly, it does go to Her Majesty to be sanctioned in her name.", "If you open up the legislation itself, I think it’s page 2 or 3, where the meat of it commences with the endless pages of amendments, it commences with, “Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the province of Ontario, enacts as follows: Development Charges Act, 1997.” Then we see close to five pages of amendments to the Development Charges Act alone. As people here would know, the rest of Bill 73 is a list of amendments to the Planning Act.", "But first I wanted to talk a bit about the Development Charges Act. As I mentioned, I was never a municipal councillor. It’s something that is out there. For many people, I would think, their eyes would glaze over discussing development charges. Many other people may not understand it. I didn’t understand a lot of details until I started looking at this legislation. At minimum, I think that people—certainly municipal people—would think we have to have a balance. Are the charges high enough to fund the infrastructure that’s required when you start building more condos or more homes or shopping plazas, facilities like that, commercial facilities? Are they perhaps too high? Are they going to inhibit economic activity? Are they going to put undue pressure on young families who wish to purchase a condo or purchase a house, or pay rent in an apartment in a building that is subject to development charges?", "So we’ve got proposed legislation. It provides the authority, it provides the rules for a municipality, if this passes, to levy development charges, done through a bylaw. It’s a revenue tool. I haven’t heard the term “revenue tool” come up this afternoon, but it is yet again another revenue tool. We understand in our readings that much of the focus is to enhance public transit, something I really do not have in my riding. There is really no such thing as public transit in Haldimand–Norfolk, certainly not in Haldimand county. Our public transit relies on making sure the gravel roads are there and we have culverts and bridges. Now, Norfolk county, more recently, got a government grant, so they have a little tiny bus with tinted windows. I’m not sure how many people ride this little bus from the various far-flung communities in Norfolk county. So public transit is a non-issue in my riding, essentially.", "There was a petition a number of years ago coming out of the town of Dunnville down in Haldimand county to encourage the municipality to set up some kind of a bus service—about 1,000 names on that petition—at minimum, perhaps to help people to get up to the city of Hamilton for shopping. But any thought of a bus or any form of public transit just does not exist at all in the east end of my riding.", "So we have a revenue tool, one more way to raise money, obviously, designed to help municipalities pay for a portion of growth-related capital—not operating budget, capital—costs incurred to provide services to new residents, new businesses. I have heard the expression, and this came up at the AMO conference this summer, “Growth to pay for growth.” I think that’s a good approach. It’s an oversimplification. So development charges—I hear them referred to as “DC” in some of the debate this afternoon—imposed at the municipal level, imposed on developers, if and when they get that building permit, again, to pay for the increased capital costs. Of course, these costs are passed on, as all costs are, to the homebuyer, for example. These charges are not to pay for operating costs or future repair or future rehabilitation of the newly developed infrastructure required for the new buildings.", "So we have a set of reforms before us to the system, again, to try and achieve that balance—I think this was described in the EBR posting as a balance between municipal and development interests. I would suggest we also have to consider the balance required with respect to the tenants of apartment buildings, the owners of new condos, or the owners of new houses. So the number one focus: enhanced funding for municipal transit—again, something that doesn’t really exist in my riding; secondly, enhanced transparency and accountability with respect to the payment of these development charges or any additional fees.", "I will say, Speaker, not having transit in my riding—I do admit I have worked in the city of Toronto, downtown, for many, many years, beyond being an MPP. I spent eight years working in this city. This would be back in 1974. I’ve been commuting on the Gardiner Expressway, off and on, for the last 40 years, I suppose. In more recent years, the last 10, 12 or 15 years, I’ve seen the—obviously, we’ve all seen the tremendous growth of the high-rises downtown, the condo towers on either side of the Gardiner Expressway.", "Where was the money? I assume these condo developers paid development charges. To what extent has that money gone into the Gardiner Expressway, which is the artery that goes right through that corridor of condos? I think of the Trump tower. I guess I ask myself—Mr. Trump certainly pats himself on the back for negotiating really good deals—who was on the other side of that deal, and what did we get out of that deal? Quite honestly, I don’t know what the development charges would have been for that particular tower or the other dozens and dozens of towers that have gone up. But what I can say is—and I haven’t talked to any downtown Toronto municipal politicians who maybe have knowledge about these deals—what did they get in return? What I see is a Gardiner Expressway that really—other than dealing with the rust on the rebar under the concrete over the years, I haven’t seen any improvements to the Gardiner.", "As a weekly commuter, we’re all fully aware of the problems. Out of necessity I commute in and out at either one or two o’clock, either one or two in the afternoon or one or two in the morning. I rode in at one o’clock this morning to attend the opening session, and I hit a combination of a bump and a pothole that woke me up at the bottom of Yonge Street, at Front Street.", "Yonge Street doesn’t look like it’s had any work done to it in the 40 years that I’ve been coming up and down Yonge Street. When I first worked in Toronto, at that time, you could walk to the bottom of Yonge Street, stick your thumb out and hitchhike home. You can’t do that now. So my question: With the development in downtown Toronto, what happened to Yonge Street, what happened to the Gardiner, if anything?", "I look at those condos and I assume somebody has added up the input to the economic base of the city of Toronto. I would get the impression, looking at these buildings, the overseas money that has gone into these buildings, that you could bury the Gardiner and you could build two brand new Gardiners, one on top of the other. You could widen the Gardiner, as we do with highways, although, again, going back to the deal, somebody has very skillfully ensured that the Gardiner Expressway will never be wider than it is now.", "We’ve been building railway tracks in this country for 150 years. We build roads. You make allowances. You allow 60 feet, 120 feet, whatever, on either side, and you do not allow brand new residential buildings next a railway track. We see these residential buildings going up in downtown Toronto cheek by jowl to the Gardiner Expressway. I guess that was part of the deal.", "Again, I don’t consider myself a resident of Toronto, but I guess I’ve worked in Toronto for something like 28 years, downtown. I may have worked in downtown Toronto longer than some of the Toronto residents who are representing their areas down here.", "So there are some of my comments on development charges. We do know—and I think this goes back to the EBR explanation—the intent here is to identify those services which are ineligible for the collection of development charges. This would be done through regulation. It’s not spelled out in the amendments that we have before us today, Speaker. It requires municipalities to examine an application of varying development charges within different areas of a municipality. That makes a tremendous amount of sense to me. The town of Caledonia was one of the most rapidly growing towns in Canada—up until nine and half years ago, when things hit the fan. I would assume, that with a high-growth area like that, you would need a much different approach to other parts of Haldimand county. I should say the whole county of Haldimand pretty well has the same population it had 100 years ago. We’re not dependent on in-migration to make money, we’re not dependent on artificial population growth to make money off newcomers. We are a sustainable economy in Haldimand county based on agriculture, based on steel, based on refining; up until recently, a coal-based economy as well.", "The fifth point to enhance the reporting requirements—and I will mention, as far as community involvement, that I polled my office last week, my constituency office. Nobody has phoned me about this legislation, nobody has sent me an email. I’ve had a few conversations in the past with developers indicating that the charges in many municipalities make up a very significant portion of the price of a new house. However, yesterday I had an opportunity to have a chat with our local Norfolk county mayor, Charlie Luke, just newly elected a year ago, although he’s been on council for something like I think over 30 years. He indicated to me that the county had a review a couple of years ago of development charges, and Mayor Luke, very astute, very knowledgeable of issues municipal, right off the top he indicated that, yes, over the years it’s always been that question of striving for a balance between how much money you hit the homebuilders with in consideration of how much is going to be passed to the prospective homeowners—in many cases new families—so that balance between encouraging economic activity and at the same time trying to get at least enough money from this growth that will help to pay for the growth, ensuring that the funds are there. Again, transit is not an issue down our way.", "We cannot have a situation where, in certain municipalities, perhaps if there’s any kind of mandated regulation, this would slow economic growth; but I know that’s a factor in greenbelt areas. I know our previous speaker, representing part of the city of Ottawa—as I understand, there’s a scale. They have a higher development charge for construction in a greenbelt. I guess you’re allowed to build in a greenbelt but you pay more in development charges as disincentive for construction in a greenbelt area in the Ottawa area.", "Patrick Brown made a speech at AMO this August fully recognizing that municipalities play a key role as drivers of our economy, fully recognizing the importance of giving municipalities—our councillors, mayors and reeves—the tools they need to better enable all of us within the province of Ontario to try to bring back our economy. These elected people are very close to the ground, good communicators, and can play a key role in bringing our economy back. Any approach—I mean, this goes without saying—has to be sensible, has to be pragmatic, at minimum, just to ensure that we can maintain that economic balance and, if anything, try to bring back a strong economy in the province of Ontario; and to better enable municipalities, as well as the provincial and federal levels, to continue to attract investment from those sources of money. Again, I think of the condos in downtown Toronto.", "Red tape is my concern with this legislation—I mean, there’s page after page of amendments. We know there is going to be a plethora of regulation coming with this, and if we vote for this legislation, the last thing we want to see is a plethora of bureaucratic red tape, rules and regulations, and forms to fill out. These municipalities do not have the resources to handle that kind of paper burden." ],

  "text" : [ "Yes, and also to be speaking to Bill 73. This piece of legislation has actually taken a long time to come here. It’s been a long process and it had a lot of consultation—I think, actually, almost 18 months of consultation on this particular piece of legislation.", "Obviously, Bill 73 is intended to give communities a greater say in how their communities grow. If many of you were at AMO this year, you would have heard councillors, wardens and reeves from across the province express an interest in actually having some support, but not too much interference, in how those communities grow.", "Interestingly, the issue of development charges was one of the first issues that our regional council brought to me as a new MPP. I think that there’s a lot of discussion right now in the province of Ontario on how those development charges are collected, how they are spent and what is a level of accountability and transparency with regard to those funds. Certainly developers have had a very strong voice in this province and have had a lot of influence on the discussion of how communities are planned for and how those communities grow.", "Bill 73, the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act, amends the Development Charges Act to remove the arbitrary 10% discount that must be applied to transit-related growth costs when calculating development charges. It also allows the LG in Council, or the cabinet, to prescribe services whose costs shall be estimated based on future plans, not past policy, which of course is important for municipalities expanding services like transit, for which it currently must base the development charges on service standards that existed in the past.", "Of course, this has been a major obstacle. For almost a decade I sat on the local school board, and it is really difficult to plan and budget for future growth. The hands of municipalities are tied in this regard. Also, I can honestly say that there needed to be greater communication between the school boards and the cities on planning for those community hubs that this government has talked about for years.", "Of course, it is very difficult to create a community hub in a school that is set to close. It’s unfortunate that the Ministry of Education amended the funding formula around students and how funding flows to school boards, because it makes it difficult for schools to actually stay open in communities. All of us have these issues in our ridings, because the value of that community school is actually not evaluated or supported at the provincial level. I do think that there is an opportunity to expand that conversation and ensure that municipalities have options. That’s really what they were asking for.", "Bill 73 also mentions that there are no more global appeals of official plans. So this is really interesting, because as the member from London West mentioned, Waterloo region is one of those test cases for how poorly the Ontario Municipal Board has operated in the province of Ontario.", "Our regional council went about an extensive consultation process. We have a very engaged community in Waterloo region. They care about how their community grows, they hold their politicians to account like no other, and they were included and engaged in this process of where to intensify the growth as it related to the Places To Grow legislation. They bought in wholeheartedly. Part of that anchor was the LRT, and that LRT is going in right now. It was all coming in very well until the developers decided to take the regional level of government and their plan to the Ontario Municipal Board. At that time, the region of Waterloo had only planned for 83 hectares of growth. They had budgeted, because there is obviously a cost. When municipalities do not take in the infrastructure maintenance and upgrading cost—there’s a cost to irresponsible planning. It’s a reality. The developers won. They took their case to the OMB. Not only did they overrule the regional level of government, but they added almost 1,000 hectares to that growth plan. Now, imagine how the electorate felt at that point in time. This is one of the issues that Bill 73 does not address.", "So, from our perspective, it’s a missed opportunity, Mr. Speaker. Municipalities from the north to the south, the rural and urban, have been asking for some reform around the Ontario Municipal Board, because they do not like getting overruled. Those OMB members are unelected. Nobody holds them to account. They are appointed by the government of day. Fundamentally, the way the public sees this issue is as unfair. You actually can’t blame them for feeling that way, Mr. Speaker.", "The other weakness that we see for Bill 73—aside from, really, a fundamental missed opportunity in addressing structural reform in the Ontario Municipal Board—is the missed opportunity around affordable housing. You know, in this day and age—I mean, all of us have been paying close attention to the federal election. All of us know that the parties are focused on housing as an economic driver; as a much-needed infrastructure investment; as a poverty reduction standard, obviously; as supportive housing for those in our society who are on the margins and who do not have the financial supports to live independently. Housing pulls it all together. It is unfortunate that inclusionary zoning is not part of this legislation.", "We actually heard a lot about it at AMO, at our independent meetings, and I know that the government heard it. I did actually ask the mayor of Mississauga at the time, “Where are you on inclusionary zoning?” The member from Parkdale–High Park has, I think, brought this piece of legislation in maybe five times now. Is it five times? Maybe the sixth time will be the charm. But the mayor of Mississauga said to me, “You know, we don’t have any trouble with that. Just don’t tie our hands on it, because that’s a problem.” So they want that tool; they want the inclusionary zoning tool to be in their toolbox. This is not news. The government has heard this for a number of years. I don’t fully understand the resistance to putting this tool on the table for municipalities, because they are looking for some flexibility in this regard.", "Just a recent—I mean, obviously, the city of Toronto is not part of AMO, but on May 8, Councillor Layton and Councillor Ana Bailão moved the recommendation to Toronto city council that they “direct the city manager, the chief planner and executive director, city planning and the director of the affordable housing office to report to planning and growth management committee on a strategy to implement inclusionary zoning in the city of Toronto.” The city of Toronto is desperate for a tool so that they can meet a growing need for affordable housing—they are.", "The second point of the recommendation of this motion was that “City council request the province, as part of Bill 73 Smart Growth for Our Communities Act, 2015, to make appropriate reforms to the Planning Act to include permissions for municipalities to enact inclusionary zoning for affordable housing of all types.”", "The city of Toronto wants the province of Ontario to come to the table. We support that. We support the inclusion of inclusionary zoning in Bill 73, the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act. We are going to try to, obviously, make this piece of legislation stronger. What I don’t understand is why inclusionary zoning was not included in the first place. This is not a new issue for the province, for the Liberal government of Ontario.", "This motion goes on to say that the “Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing is currently undertaking three parallel public consultations impacting housing in municipalities”—the minister’s here today—“the Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy, Bill 73 Smart Growth for Our Communities Act, 2015 proposing changes to the Planning Act, and the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe.” Personally, I think that you should probably be looking at the Toronto housing corporation as well, and all that that entails.", "The motion, actually, is really very strong, Mr. Speaker. It goes on to say, “Inclusionary zoning would empower the city to make responsible land use decisions that would have lasting benefits to the city and province. Inclusionary zoning allows us to build complete communities, it would help us to build a more affordable city and to overcome inequalities between communities.”", "This is something that needs to happen in the province of Ontario. We can make a strong economic argument. We can make an environmental argument. There are justice issues and health care issues at play here. That is how powerful housing legislation is when you get it right. Bill 73 needs to be stronger on this issue.", "It goes on to say, “Despite the city of Toronto’s repeated requests for inclusionary zoning over the last decade, the province does not permit Ontario cities the authority to enact inclusionary zoning. Meanwhile, our city is desperately in need of more affordable housing.", "“Inclusionary zoning would empower the city to require developers to include a percentage of affordable housing units in residential developments with over 20 units and in return they could receive fast-tracked approvals and other incentives. This would help us to create a steady and growing supply of affordable rent and affordable home ownership units across the city, building and fostering mixed-income neighbourhoods and providing our residents with more equal access to resources and opportunities.”", "This is how you build strong cities. If you build strong cities, if you empower cities to meet the needs of their constituents, you have a stronger democracy. When you have stronger cities, you have a stronger province. When you have a stronger province, we have a stronger country. That is how powerful getting progressive planning practices right, that is how powerful getting housing policy right can be.", "I know that the members on the other side of the House have heard this. I know that the minister understands how inclusionary zoning works. I know that he has heard it for years. I know that his community, his constituency would benefit from inclusionary zoning. And yet, Bill 73, the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act, 2015, does not include inclusionary zoning.", "I get a little tired of this. I just don’t understand why you would not craft a piece of legislation at the first and make it as strong as you can. If you had this piece in it, you would take a major avenue of criticism out. Of course, when it gets to committee, we’re going to try to make sure that inclusionary zoning is included.", "But just to recap, this motion was brought by Councillor Layton and seconded by Councillor Ana Bailão on May 8, 2015, so this just happened in the spring. This is a current motion. This is the biggest city in the country asking the province to get behind a proven method of building affordable housing, creating greater equality in our communities, mixed-node growth, and for some reason, it’s missing. I’m always interested to hear how the government is going to respond to this, but I have to tell you, while there are some good things in this bill, there’s always something that has made its way through, year after year after year, which is actually pretty strong.", "The United Nations, just in June, came out and criticized this country, and thus these provinces, for failing on affordable housing. You would never meet your poverty reduction standards—or targets, if you had targets—without a progressive, affordable housing strategy.", "The motion goes on to say, “The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing is currently undertaking a review of the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe and the Greenbelt Plan. These plans aim to manage the rapid population growth and employment growth in Ontario. Any growth strategy must include provisions for the need for affordable housing.”", "This is why housing connects everything in the province. You have people who can no longer afford to live in the core of Toronto unless those housing stocks are so dilapidated and they’re just holding on to those rental spaces. When those people leave those rental spaces, then the population of the local school drops to the point where you no longer have the funding to keep those programs and those schools viable. Therefore, that school then closes, and then the government comes out and says, “We want to create community hubs in high-needs areas.” You can’t do that because you don’t have the housing, you don’t have the students, you don’t have the families and you don’t have the tipping point to create stronger community hubs which are more equal and more prosperous and safer. That is the power of housing, and that is missing from Bill 73, which is most unfortunate.", "There does appear, though—with this motion, there’s a bit of hope. There’s a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel here, because the motion goes on to say, “There appears to be an appetite for inclusionary zoning from some members of provincial Parliament and across political party lines”—and I do believe that. You know how I know that that exists? Because one of their own members, the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore, introduced Bill 39. It’s interesting, because Bill 73 is far less ambitious than Bill 39—and that member is from Etobicoke–Lakeshore; he’s not here right now—and we did support that bill. We supported that bill, but we complained that it should have been part of the government’s bill.", "This is also a disturbing little pattern here. Individual members on that side of the House have great knowledge. This member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore was a councillor, so he understood the challenges that municipalities have in working with the province, and he brought forward this private member’s bill to address the gap, if you will, in knowledge and political will and funding so that municipalities don’t have their hands tied on creating affordable, accessible housing. When he brought this forward, nothing happened with that. That private member’s bill is just going to sit there. The strongest parts of the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore’s bill are not contained in Bill 73. The government, for some reason, ignored one of their own members and the recommendations that he had in that legislation which would make this piece of legislation stronger. For us, that doesn’t make any sense.", "However, that goodwill is still there. There are still people in all of these parties who recognize the value of inclusionary zoning. They like that idea because there isn’t any cost to the province. So if the President of the Treasury Board is looking at ways to stimulate the economy and strengthen communities and address poverty, then the best way to do that is to ensure that municipalities have the flexibility to actually act upon the goals of those said policies around poverty reduction.", "This motion ends by saying, “The city should make sure it is in a position to implement inclusionary zoning as soon as permission is granted so that there is no delay in taking action to build a more affordable city.” I would add: “when the province creates a piece of legislation that allows the city of Toronto to actually follow through on that mandate.”", "AMO is a major player, obviously. We all were in beautiful Niagara Falls this summer. We all had the opportunity to sit down and listen to our local counterparts from across the province, and we have a responsibility to act on what we heard.", "For me, this is my third anniversary of standing in this House—" ],

The municipalities, I think, have reached the end of their rope with the talk and with the conversation and the consultation. There was a little bit of an edge, and you can tell that that’s reflected as they respond to Bill 73.", "This is from AMO’s web page and from their response to Bill 73. It says: “AMO remains concerned that growth is not adequately paying for growth.” The planning process is not responsive enough to actually afford the kind of growth that the province is asking of municipalities.", "“Provincial plans must be better coordinated, with clear time frames for review”—that goes without saying.", "“Under Bill 73, changes that limit appeals, require more rationale for appeals, and require the OMB to ‘have regard’ for municipal decisions” are a step in the right direction. But the language of “having regard”—so the Ontario Municipal Board, an unelected, unaccountable group of people, must “have regard” for municipalities that are duly elected by the electorate and who are responsive and engaged with the electorate?", "So Bill 73 misses a much-needed opportunity to do some true reform of the Ontario Municipal Board. I think I made my point clear on how I feel about inclusionary zoning and why it needs to be part of this legislation. I hope, as this piece of legislation moves forward, that the government is receptive to incorporating some of the ideas that we have put forward that would make a difference to the people of this province." ],

We do go to committee, and hopefully the minister will bring this bill to committee and have substantial discussion at committee. Because some of the points that were brought up by the member for Kitchener–Waterloo are valid, but I only have about a minute and a half to address them.", "I think, first of all, this piece of legislation is very important. I spent nine years as a city of Scarborough councillor and another six years as a city of Toronto councillor, and planning was everywhere. When I first got on city council in 1988, council was deciding minor things like minor variances, so we’d hear it during the planning committee, and then we’d have another full hearing at the city council. So we were backlogged with minor variances and zoning applications, and then every five years we’d have to update our official plan. I had an opportunity to be on the city of Toronto council when we updated that plan. It was a very, very complicated discussion and I think the majority won out. There were a lot of people who were unhappy on council.", "Just in the few minutes, I want to say that this bill is very important in both the development charges and in the Planning Act. It got to some point on city council where councillors who had a development in their riding, a big one, would bully the developer, saying where the money—the development charges—should go. Sometimes it had nothing to do with the building itself. It would leave a lot of people frustrated at the end of the day.", "I think that when this goes to committee, it will have a chance to be debated properly. Unfortunately, my two minutes are up.

It was a bit of a hard-hitting speech, talking about the money side of it. He indicated that, sure, the province wants to work with municipalities to achieve better outcomes, but the interpretation from the province to achieve better outcomes oftentimes comes at the expense of the municipality. That’s been a kind of burr under the saddle for many, many years.", "In his address, McNamara brought out some figures. He indicated that provincial and federal governments receive four to five times more tax revenue than municipalities, as far as their share. Municipalities comprise about nine cents out of every household tax dollar. They make it clear that they have a revenue problem. I do not feel that the province of Ontario has a revenue problem, and for that matter, the federal government doesn’t have a revenue problem." ],

Yes, we don’t agree on everything, but it’s the only province in Canada that has that kind of relationship with municipalities.

That criticism came from the other party.", "To the members from Scarborough Southwest, Haldimand–Norfolk and Windsor–Tecumseh: As always, thank you for raising the ire that AMO had for this government on housing. It wasn’t just as it relates to planning and tying the hands of municipalities; it actually has more to do, and more so than any other year, with the cost of maintenance of the affordable housing units that they have within their own communities.", "If you think about this, this is a long-standing issue that AMO has brought to the government.

Citizens are engaged in seeing what’s going to come out of this bill. I know that there’s great hope that it will be improved upon. I myself sat on many planning-related issues and task forces before I was elected so it’s certainly something that I’m very happy to weigh in on.", "This bill, if passed, would ensure that the development charges and land use planning and appeal systems are more predictable, transparent, cost-effective and that they better meet the needs of the stakeholders as well as the communities. The proposed amendments to the Planning Act focus on enhancing citizen engagement, achieving more predictability, supporting municipal leadership and protecting long-term public interests.", "Amendments to the Development Charges Act, 1997, will focus on providing the ability for municipalities to raise revenue for key growth-related infrastructure—for example, transit—and enhance accountability and transparency regarding the collection and spending of development charge reserve funds.", "The feedback from a public consultation that was conducted from October 2013 to January 2014 informed the proposed changes to the Development Charges Act, 1997, and the Planning Act. Some of the proposed amendments are going to address things like increasing funding for growth-related infrastructure. Removing the mandatory 10% discount required when levying a charge for transit service will certainly help municipalities that are looking to find ways of increasing revenue, to ensure that their communities can weigh in and have some more transit-related issues—certainly, something I heard a lot about at the AMO and ROMA conferences recently.", "It will also enhance the transparency and accountability. It will require municipalities to reflect capital projects funded through development charges in a very detailed report. It will also link development charges to municipal asset management plans, which is very important to municipalities across Ontario. Certainly, it’s important to my communities of Cambridge and North Dumfries township.", "It will require development charges to be set as of the date that an initial building permit is issued for buildings, even those requiring multiple permits. One criticism I’ve heard from developers over the years of sitting on many planning-related issues is about the lack of streamlining when it comes to addressing putting in an initial proposal, from a heritage impact assessment or what’s going to go on in the future. This will certainly help to streamline the process for developers, as well as municipalities, and get on with the project at hand in a much more time-sensitive manner.", "This bill will also restrict payments outside the development charges regime for the capital costs that are associated with servicing new development, and it will require municipal treasurers to certify that no payments have been received that are in contravention of this restriction. It will also create an authority for the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing to investigate any municipality in relation to its compliance with this act. It will also create an authority for the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing to require a municipality to cover the cost of a compliance investigation, something that will certainly help to solidify the municipalities in doing things in an open and transparent manner.", "Another thing that I really was pleased to see in this particular proposed bill was the enhanced citizen engagement. Speaker, I sat on many community groups, not-for-profits etc. dealing with planning-related issues, heritage matters, and found that the one issue that they really complained about in any development application process was that once they got to a public information session, they felt that it was too quick, that the messages were key messages that were brought across to the meeting and that the citizens really had no meaningful debate or commentary on these issues. I know that many interested citizens and community members that I dealt with in Cambridge and North Dumfries would often say that it seems to be a line item on a list of things the developer has to tick off. They had the public information meeting; they ticked it off; they went away. They took no notice of what was said by the citizens when it came to that planning-related issue that they wanted to weigh in on.", "This proposed bill will require municipalities and approval authorities to explain how public input affected their planning decision.", "It will also require the municipal official plans to include locally designed public consultation policies, which I find very effective, because not every municipality, as we know, is created alike. I come from a municipality that’s part urban, part rural, and the citizens often approach their planning issues in a bit of a different way. So this helps to individualize what’s going to work for that particular community.", "I’m also pleased to see that there will be increased use of planning advisory committees, and it will ensure that citizen membership on these committees is robust and that they actually have a voice.", "I’m also pleased to see that there’s going to be increased local decision-making and accountability. Renaming the development permit system as the community planning permit system really cements and underlines the fact that this government is listening to the citizens of Ontario and putting in more opportunities for citizens to be engaged in the planning of their communities. It will prevent applicant-initiated amendments to it for five years, in order to facilitate implementation of the system. It will also provide municipalities more time to resolve disputes locally, which is where it should be done.", "Another real benefit to this proposed bill is to increase certainty and stability, and reduce costs. When any municipality embarks on making a new official plan or reviewing their current plan every five years, it’s a significant cost and time effort that really underscores the fact that having it reviewed on a 10-year, rather than five-year, basis will really assist the municipality to get through the process in a timely manner. It will limit approvals or appeals from a lower-tier official plan, unless it conforms to the upper-tier official plan.", "One other issue that happened in Waterloo region was that Waterloo region embarked on its ROP, its regional official plan, a few years ago. It was appealed and taken to the OMB. That held up several developers from being able to get on with their planning-related projects and cost the citizens and the developers in terms of time and the ability to get on with these.", "I’m very happy to see that this particular proposed bill will remove the ability for appellants to appeal an entire new official plan. I think that that’s going to certainly streamline the process and allow the developers to get on with their approved projects and get these things built. It will also prohibit appeals when municipalities are implementing specific provincially approved matters into their own official plans. That will certainly help.", "The last thing that I really am very pleased to see in this bill is a stakeholder working group that would be relating to the Planning Act. A stakeholder working group would be established to provide recommendations on these issues we’ve been talking about, issues regarding the definition of minor variance, regulation standards for notices, and regulation standards for public engagement.", "To wrap up, Speaker, I really do support Bill 73. Our reforms to the Planning Act and the Development Charges Act would make sure that growth in Ontario is managed smartly. We are proposing changes to the tools and processes that communities and citizens can use to determine how their neighbourhoods grow and to plan and pay for this growth, which is certainly important to my constituents in Cambridge and North Dumfries township.

The bill, if passed, would ensure that development charges and land use planning and appeal systems are more predictable, transparent, cost-effective and better meet the needs of stakeholders, families and communities.", "Amendments to the Planning Act focus on enhancing citizen engagement, as I mentioned before, achieving more predictability, supporting municipal leadership and protecting long-term public interests.", "Amendments to the Development Charges Act focus on providing the ability for municipalities to raise revenue for key growth-related infrastructure—things like transit—and enhance accountability and transparency regarding the collection and spending of development charge reserve funds.", "The feedback from the public consultation, I understand from talking to the minister—I’d like to congratulate him for bringing forward this bill.

That’s reflected, I believe, in the bill.", "The feedback from the public consultations from October 2013 through to January 2014 is reflected in this bill.

The Hydro One fire sale: We already have, I believe, 185,000 constituents saying they don’t want this to happen—no consultation there.

It was a commitment back in 2003. We set it up, and any legislation that directly impacts on the municipal sector goes through significant consultation and goes through the AMO round table that the minister meets and hosts once a month.

New neighbours ultimately pay every new tax generated by government. If municipalities believe that transit is the priority project, they have a responsibility to be accountable, transparent and fair in how they determine the entire tax bill that falls on the back of new home buyers and businesses.’”", "There was also a concern raised by AMO. Of course, I said earlier that we heard that, all members did, at the AMO conference recently. AMO has said that elements of the bill are problematic. It goes on to say that AMO objects to the requirement for an upper-tier planning advisory committee with at least one member of the public. The mandatory PAC will create more issues than it resolves. This was a requirement of the Planning Act in the 1970s and 1980s, but PACs were deemed not to be effective on a broad basis and made discretionary.", "I wanted to read these comments into Hansard to ensure that the government is aware what some of the stakeholders are saying about this legislation." ],

I’ve said that a couple of times already in this House. I’m going to spend a bit more of my 20 minutes now to talk about that. As part of the minister’s mandate letter, he was tasked with conducting a full review of the Ontario Municipal Board, but this bill has tabled a number of changes to the board before the review has even been conducted.", "The province indicated that they want to have conversation, consultation, and I believe that the Liberals like to use these words interchangeably often. What we want to see at some point is action that, sadly, is lacking. The province has indicated that Bill 73 would give residents more say in how their communities grow, would set out clear rules for land use planning, give municipalities more independence to make local decisions, and also make it easier to resolve disputes through a so-called community planning permit system.", "Mr. Speaker, forgive me if I seem a little bit cynical, but I wonder if there will be any more consideration in regard to the location of wind turbines, seeing as the Liberal government took power away from municipalities for something like this, a planning issue in all of our municipalities across Ontario. They took the ability from municipalities to even have a say in that. I struggle when they come out with new legislation saying that they’re going to give all of this say and all this input, again reflecting on how they’ve rammed the legislation through before they actually finish the review of the OMB.", "Municipalities will levy development charges to recover the capital costs in providing municipal services to new housing subdivisions and developments, i.e. roads, sidewalks, sewers and waterlines. In 1997, the province put strict limits on the funds municipalities could recover through development charges. AMO says that $550 million in growth-related costs went from developers to taxpayers with this change. Development charges represent about 15% of total municipal capital funding for most communities.", "I’m disappointed that Bill 73 puts legislation before consultation. We’ve seen this over and over again, Mr. Speaker. Just recently, the fire sale of Hydro One—a lot of people are coming out against that. They want to be heard. They want their voice heard before this happens. The government seems to be steamrolling. I’ve already said earlier with the Green Energy Act—a very similar lack of consultation. The Ontario Retirement Pension Plan is another one of those that significant groups—the Canadian Federation of Independent Business came out, the chamber of commerce has come out, saying that this is bad, that small business is worried significantly about that. Where has the consultation been? Where is the ability to have their voice heard?", "In this case, the greenbelt, the Niagara Escarpment, the Oak Ridges moraine were all supposed to be completed, along with a review of the Ontario Municipal Board. However, they’ve now put legislation forward without any of those being actually completed. So again, Mr. Speaker, when they say that they want to have the conversation, that they want to have consultation, it’s very challenging for me when they actually bring the legislation forward before those are completed.", "We’re very concerned that there’s going to be more red tape in the governance of municipalities in Ontario. Again, similar to small business, large business—we’re hearing of more and more red tape that is stifling their ability be as productive as possible, challenging them to spend more and more precious hours doing paperwork, administration and bureaucracy than actually working with their customers and clients.", "Development charges are and should be a balance between encouraging economic activity and ensuring that municipalities have the funds to provide services for added growth. While we support funding transit, we have concerns that this act may allow development charges to be increased so much that it actually slows down economic growth.", "Our primary focus remains, in our party, balancing the budget and returning Ontario to financial prosperity. This economic growth would benefit our municipal partners as well, as long as we’re allowing them to move forward in an expedited, balanced manner to ensure that there’s more growth, there are more jobs, and thus, the creation of a sustainable economy.", "As the government minister heard at the recent AMO conference and at the Ontario Good Roads Association earlier this year, a number of municipalities feel that the proposed changes to the Development Charges Act and the Planning Act could be more of a roadblock than a benefit to development. Again, you would have thought that they would have had wide, broad consultation and ensured that all of the thought that they are putting into this would have actually allowed for a smoother system, a more precise system, that everybody understood and could move forward with, that there wasn’t confusion, there wasn’t contradiction. I’m going to talk about those in a few minutes, Mr. Speaker.", "You want legislation to be actually valid for all of the users. You want to consult them and make sure that we’re not putting things in, even inadvertently. We can all make mistakes, but if you had done proper consultation, if you had spent the time out in the communities, talking to the municipalities and not just a couple of hand-chosen people to say you’re consulting—like was done in many of our educational files—then we could have truly said that we had consultation.", "In my great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, Grey county has actually voiced its concerns with certain parts of Bill 73. Namely, the consensus is that everyone is concerned that the new official plans cannot be amended for two years after being approved unless initiated by the municipality itself.", "Concern number one is raised: a two-year freeze period for applications to amend an official plan or zoning bylaw following the adoption of a new official plan, subsection 22(2.1), or the replacement update of a municipality’s zoning bylaw, subsection 34(10.0.0.1).", "Grey county is concerned about the impact on economic development opportunities. They see this as potentially a roadblock. What if someone comes within that two-year period and wants to do a development? They can’t even talk for two years. With 700,000 people unemployed in this great province, we need to be finding ways to allow people to move forward as quickly—in a balanced manner, of course—as they can to ensure that development takes place, and the resulting jobs are created as a result of that.", "If a development proposal came forward within the two-year freeze period, and the development required either an official plan amendment or a zoning bylaw amendment, then the developer would not be able to apply for an amendment. That doesn’t make sense, Mr. Speaker. There have to be provisions to allow that to move forward.", "Then there are more unique situations, such as if a proposal came forward that was never envisioned or contemplated by a council at the time when planning documents were being prepared and updated, and therefore was not identified as a permitted use.", "One such example of a unique land use—we’ve seen it across the province—is medical marijuana facilities. The council may not have even thought of that being something that the federal government was moving forward on when they actually did their zoning bylaws or their planning documents. But it’s a reality of our country today, of our province, certainly, today, and that has to be able to have a provision to incorporate that and to, again, expedite.", "Many communities, many developers are out there. They’ve got projects almost half done, waiting for final approval. What would happen in this case? A two-year roadblock. Many companies can’t afford to wait two years with investment money sitting there. They want to be able to move forward. They want to be able to create that employment. They want to be productive, contributing corporations within our province. Lord knows we need it, with 700,000 people unemployed and more every day due to the rising costs of power, our hydro, the fire sale that’s imminently coming forward.", "We need to make sure that when you create legislation it allows the opportunity for these unexpected, unintended things to be brought forward and dealt with in a timely manner. A council may very well, as I’ve said, be supportive of these facilities, but never considered permitting them specifically in the municipalities’ planning documents because they are a fairly recent phenomenon. What the municipalities in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound have recommended to the minister is that he revise these sections to indicate that the receiving of such applications within the two-year freeze period be at the discretion of council, to ensure that any economic development opportunities that council supports could still proceed in a timely manner.", "Those local municipalities need the ability to move forward. They are the closest to the people. They understand their community best. I’ve referenced in here a number of times—today, even—the Green Energy Act, where this Liberal government took away the ability for local municipalities to have any say in those types of developments. It has had a huge impact, a negative impact, certainly across rural Ontario specifically, but across the whole province. The unintended consequences of that are thousands and thousands of people losing their jobs and companies leaving this great province because of the increased hydro rates, as a result, partially, of those significant developments.", "Concern number two: The proposed section 8(1) would require that the council of every upper-tier municipality and the council of every lower-tier municipality that is not in a territorial district shall appoint a planning advisory committee and shall include at least one member who is neither a councillor nor a municipal employee. Should the above sections be approved by the province, the county would be required to establish a planning advisory committee with at least one representative who is not a councillor or a municipal employee.", "It is not clear at this stage what the roles and responsibilities will be of the planning advisory committee. Would the planning advisory committee be responsible for reviewing planning applications? You would think something so simple could be black and white and very clear from the very start of that legislation. Why is such a basic question still being asked, even though this has been implemented, supposedly with lots of conversation and consultation?", "The requirement for public representation on planning advisory committees could fundamentally change the current standing committee structure that the county has in place for planning matters. Questions remain about the roles and responsibilities of the planning advisory committee, and staff recommend that the province provide further detail on the purpose of the planning advisory committee and expectations on the roles and responsibilities of the said committee.", "Concerns about duplication: If they already have a planning committee, and now you have to have another advisory committee—I think you would agree with me, Mr. Speaker, it makes no sense to continue to review and review, when you’ve already got a body in place to do it. I ask the question: Could conversation/consultation have had a positive and more effective result for this legislation if they had taken the time to do it, rather than moving forward in such haste?", "Concern number three, as brought forward by the municipalities: Section 8(2) indicates that the council of a lower-tier municipality, the council of a single-tier municipality that is in a territorial district, or the township of Pelee, for example, may appoint a planning advisory committee. It appears that the wording of these sections conflicts with one another with respect to whether or not lower tiers are required to appoint a planning advisory committee.", "Section 8(1) states that unless you’re in a territorial district, lower-tier municipalities shall appoint a planning advisory committee; however, it appears that section 8(2) provides an option for lower-tier municipalities. As such, Grey county recommends that the province revise these sections and clarify whether or not lower-tier municipalities have the option of appointing a planning advisory committee. Again I ask, Mr. Speaker, could conversation/consultation avoid duplication, wasted time and resources?", "Municipalities are always challenged with more legislative requirements, more administration, more bureaucracy, but expected to produce the same and not raise taxes. Here’s another example, yet again, of those municipalities being hammered by a government that hasn’t taken enough time to consult properly and ensure that they’re not going to actually put an unintended negative consequence onto them. I’ll reference, back in my old critic role—SAMS was one of those. It was rolled out after being suggested it be deferred, and it was deferred a couple of times. However, at the end of the day they rolled it out, and they have now spent $20 million of your taxpayer money, Mr. Speaker, to actually pay the municipalities for overtime incurred because of their haste and their lack of consultation with the right front-line stakeholders.", "I know the minister has tried hard to rectify this. It may not have been her total responsibility that this was an absolute boondoggle. On the other hand, we’re not letting her off the hook. We will stand here and keep her committed. My colleague Mr. Pettapiece has now picked up the torch of community and social services. I know that he is prepared, on behalf of the taxpayers of Ontario, to continue to push that minister to fix that system and not waste any other money, money that is not going to our health care needs, to our education needs, to those people in Community Living that don’t have the housing they so richly deserve, and to the mental health services that we so richly deserve. So I know we’re in good stead with my colleague Mr. Pettapiece, who will continue to push. But it’s just an example that I highlight, that a lack of consultation in moving something forward is actually costing the taxpayer a lot of money and is resulting in a lot of cases.", "About two weeks ago, I was in another riding accompanied by our leader, Patrick Brown, at a seniors’ care facility. It was interesting to see that some of the cuts to physiotherapy were starting to impact some of the residents there. They weren’t able to be as mobile, which then created more falls, which then sent them to the emergency—our most costly form of health care in our province.", "I’m trying to paint the picture that some of these decisions, when they’re hastily made, actually impact people on the front lines, particularly those people who need services in a timely manner, Mr. Speaker.", "Concern number four—I’ll go back to my concerns, and I’ll revisit a few of these points a little later—is the requirement to report in notice of decisions the effect, if any, that written and oral submissions had on decisions. The county is very concerned that this could be difficult to implement and interpret unless there is a prescriptive accompanying regulation. Depending upon the level of detail required, the notice of decisions could become quite lengthy. It is recommended that further information be provided by the province regarding the level of detail expected to be included as part of the notice of decision. These are people at the municipal level. These are the councillors who are actually required to implement these pieces of legislation, and the staff.", "I ask again, and I think this is the third or fourth time today in my short 20 minutes that I ask: Could conversation/consultation have avoided confusion, costly delay and frustration for municipalities to conform to legislation that we don’t believe, hearing directly from them—these aren’t my words. This is them providing their input back to me as the democratically elected representative for the great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, that I’m bringing on their behalf to this government to say: Please stop before you do this. Let’s actually do some consultation. Let’s truly listen and learn before we implement, rather than having to reverse everything afterward and wasting all that time, all that energy and all of those resources, not to mention the angst of all the people involved, the challenges for the developers who want to invest money here in Ontario, and we hope they will stay around long enough to invest. We need to do it, Mr. Speaker, with thought to what the end result is and how many people we can continue to serve.", "With regard to development charges in my riding, builders have called on the Owen Sound council recently to bring in a moratorium on charging the fee, calling it a hindrance to much-needed growth in the city. This is after the city reduced development charges back in 2010.

It isn’t something where there is conformity across all jurisdictions. If one municipality actually implements development charges and the other one doesn’t, typically that money flows to the community that doesn’t have development charges, so again we’re creating unequal playing fields. We need to make sure that we do this in a balanced manner, we consult all people, and we do it in a way that is going to benefit everyone.", "This president of the Grey-Bruce home builders’ association is absolutely right. In the end, Owen Sound unanimously voted in a two-year holiday on the city charging the fees for new residential construction. They did so to spur on more growth, again hoping that that developer would choose to come to the great city of Owen Sound to develop, as opposed to going somewhere else across the province.", "On the other hand, again in my riding, the great town of Meaford is debating increasing their charge for a new single-family home to $13,700 from $12,000. Again, it’s no easy decision, as unaffordability can and will impede development in small-town Ontario.", "It becomes challenging. All municipalities, again, because of the added challenges, the added cost of hydro, the added payroll tax that’s coming, the added cost of hydro that’s going to double and triple in the next three years—the increased red-tape burden that this government keeps putting on them continues to challenge them to stay and provide the services without exorbitant tax increases.", "Of course, there are municipalities in Bruce and Grey with no development charges for new residential, commercial or industrial development, such as Hanover and Georgian Bluffs. Again, it’s very challenging. Within the same geographic location some do charge, some don’t charge, so it’s a very challenging dynamic.", "While we, in principle, agree that growth must pay for growth and the cost to expand infrastructure shouldn’t fall on existing taxpayers, Bill 73 would increase development charges and, I fear, the impact on local communities and families. It may actually result in a negative impact, as opposed to the intended—I trust—positive impact.", "Unlike here in downtown Toronto: When I drive into the city every week when we come back to the Legislature, I see the cranes. You see how much activity is here. Some are actually showing concern that there may be too many condos being developed here. That’s not my place to say; the market will work itself out. But it certainly isn’t case the in rural Ontario, where housing is not booming all over the place and we cannot necessarily afford to be slowed much more.", "If we don’t have development, if we don’t have the ability to continue to move and grow, we are again going to be in a state of stagnation. The building necessary to sustain all of the services and programs in rural Ontario will very much be hindered if we aren’t able to develop and grow as a result of this legislation that I believe has not had significant consultation and conversation with the stakeholders, with the people out there who really know their game and can really step up to the plate.", "This government loves to talk. This Liberal government loves to talk about transparency and accountability. Its municipal affairs minister likes to talk about how planning disputes should be dealt with locally whenever possible. I could go on and on about how their mantra does not hold true for rural Ontario when it comes to the Green Energy Act, as I’ve said before. They took away all of the rights of the municipal, democratically, locally elected people to have a say in the development of those types of structures in their own backyards, despite the people of those areas overwhelmingly not wanting them.", "In the case of auto insurance and the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, there has been very little consultation. A lot of people out there do not want this, do not understand it and are worried about what the negative impact could be.", "I have to finish on the fire sale of Hydro One. We have people from across this great province saying this is a wrong-headed decision. This is not good in the long term for us as taxpayers. It’s not going to be good for my kids and grandkids down the road. Please step back and rethink this. Truly do consultations and serve the people you’ve been elected to.", "This government continues to override municipal planning and to force wind turbine projects on unwilling host municipalities. The objective of this legislation should be to ensure that families can have a new home and new businesses can be built and create jobs, while controlling sprawl and protecting our environment and preserving prime agricultural land." ],

We heard it at AMO too. As long as any legislation that comes from the government doesn’t tie the hands of municipalities, municipalities, including the largest municipality in the country, the city of Toronto, want this to be in their tool box so that they can create more affordable, more accessible, equal housing.", "The truth of the matter is, though, that there has been a lot of consultation, and not a lot happened.

I guess the name the government’s using is the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act.", "One of the great things about being able to sit and listen to these debates is that you hear perspectives from different walks of life, different parts of the province. Actually, if you really sit and listen, especially to this debate—planning is not usually a riveting discussion, but it’s a very important discussion. Anyone who has any municipal background knows that some of the most fierce debates and fierce problems are with planning. Coming from northern Ontario, I’m going to be really upfront: In rural Ontario, we don’t have a lot of the same type of issues with planning as some of the really urban parts of Ontario. It’s one of the great things about our province that we are so varied, but it’s also, for places that are outside the norm like some parts of rural Ontario—and northern Ontario is a lot like that—a lot of our issues regarding land-use planning are—maybe the word isn’t “forgotten” or “overlooked” but “diminished.”", "We do have issues with the OMB. We actually do have, in some of my bigger municipalities, issues with development charges because a lot of the infrastructure in the older parts of town is falling apart and you can’t really develop the newer part of town until you fix the older part of town, because they’re interconnected. That’s a huge problem. We don’t get, in my office, a lot of calls about that, but we do get a lot of calls about other parts of planning. The member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound mentioned something about agriculture, and we get a lot of calls about agriculture planning in my riding.", "I have a lot of agriculture in my riding. The centre is very agriculture-oriented. The north is getting there too. Here in the south, you’re no longer allowed to build solar farms on class 1, 2 and, I believe, 3 land. That’s great. I’m not a big solar farm fan in the first place, but that’s great. But in northern Ontario, guess where all the solar farms are going? Our best land. It’s the same province. It’s supposed to be the same planning—but different rules, and that’s a problem. Should it be addressed in Bill 73? I don’t know, but it’s a planning problem. If one of the goals of Bill 73 and other initiatives like the greenbelt—if one of their initiatives is to protect agricultural land, why aren’t we protecting all good agricultural land? If someone is going to say, “Well, that’s just northern Ontario,” I defy you. The combines are, right as we speak, in fields in Timiskaming taking yields off that are equivalent to anywhere else in the province and, I’d say, for this year anywhere else in Canada. Yet, there is nothing protecting that land from solar farms. Somehow, that has been missed.", "We hear in this bill that there are different rules for single-tier municipalities and two-tier municipalities. Well, an issue we have in the north is the zero-tier municipality, the unorganized municipality. We don’t talk about that a lot, but we have municipalities that have no representation by any other elected body than the province. They pay their taxes directly to the province, and their taxes are very low. That’s a good thing for the people who live there, but as a result, a lot of people move to the unorganized municipalities, which makes sense. If you’re close to an organized municipality—a town—you expect your soft services from the town: your arena, your library, your pool; stuff like that. You expect that from the town. But not a cent of that tax goes to that municipality.", "The province has made steps. They’re talking about it. They’re talking about changing the tax regime for unorganized municipalities. We’re not opposed to that. Where we have to be really careful is that when they make those adjustments to actually make those people pay realistic taxes, those taxes actually go to the level of government that’s providing the services to those people. That’s not happening now. That, in the big picture, might not be a huge issue, but for the planning decisions for the people in my part of the world, it’s a big, big one, because it’s stretching the towns, who are surrounded by unorganized—it’s stretching them to the limit. A little bit of tax tinkering and having more money come to the province from unorganized is not going to solve that problem.", "Likewise, the people in unorganized, who have had to create all of their own hard services—their own water, their own sewer—a lot of people don’t realize that there are a lot of people in northern Ontario who don’t have 911, specifically in unorganized townships. They’re worried, and rightfully so, that their taxes are going to go through the roof, because there are services they’re never going to get. In most unorganized municipalities, you are never going to see water and sewer, so you’re always going to have to pay for that yourself.", "They’re rightfully worried. They don’t want to pay the same taxes that people who have full services have. It has happened in our area that towns have annexed other parts of unorganized basically as a tax grab, and people are rightfully worried about that. That is a huge planning issue in northern Ontario.", "I’d like to return, because it’s—what’s your riding, Randy? What’s your riding?" ],

But we keep hearing about climate change. Do you know what? One of the impacts of climate change is that we grow great crops in northern Ontario. It’s time that, if the government is serious about things like climate change and about the big-picture things, it should also think about the little details—which aren’t little—to protect the land that actually is benefiting from climate change. You should protect that as well, because when it comes—there are some areas that are going to lose. It’s pretty sad if we cover over the areas that are actually going to become more productive, good agricultural land, with industrial installations which, in some cases, we don’t really need.", "What really galls me about a lot of these discussions—I’m not saying that this is a bad discussion. Hopefully, I’m adding to it. Hopefully, we are adding to it. But we could be talking about much bigger issues, like, why didn’t we have a full, wholesome, public debate about the advantages—if there are any—and disadvantages of selling Hydro One?

You talked about how your solar farms are going on class 1, 2 and 3 lands, which is a terrible thing to be occurring and should be stopped, even though it’s not been. This government approved a solar farm right beside developed land outside of a small municipality. With some of the setbacks that were given as a provision, it’s basically neutered any ability for development to occur in a certain part of this land, where they have already paid for sewer and water to be there. So the city has just wasted tons of amounts of money to invest in this. The developers have that money sitting there that they’re hoping to get back from the constituents who buy the houses, which aren’t going to be developed there. It’s that type of non-consultation that’s going forward.", "I’m sure this whole situation probably could have been fixed, because the municipality has a piece of land which is not going to be developed for anything, ever. It could be suitable for a solar farm. They probably could have worked out a great deal with the ministry and the solar development company and still have had the development go forward.", "It’s the lack of consultation that you spell out that is not occurring in northern nor in southern, rural Ontario.

We always had problems.", "To streamline the act and to make it better is certainly a movement in the right direction. However, over the years, I also saw some very bad decisions. In reference to landfill sites, I can give you a perfect example: the Taro landfill, which was a real controversial landfill that was built on Hamilton Mountain, on fractured bedrock. The government of the day allowed that project to go forward. They actually weakened the EA process at the time. That also falls under the Planning Act, because a lot of planning and development that goes on in municipalities overlaps other jurisdictions and other ministries.", "To streamline it is good, but the problem is the enforcement. Once again, that landfill—there was supposed to be non-hazardous material going in there. There was hazardous material that went in on fractured bedrock. I saw that.", "So it’s great to have a bill, but if you don’t enforce and follow up with the bill, then things can happen. I saw so many times where it ended up being appealed and shot down by the OMB because the decision had already been made. But if the Planning Act is not followed and the municipality cannot enforce the Planning Act, and the government here in Toronto doesn’t co-operate with the decisions of the OMB, then it causes major problems. I saw that on a regular basis, and I don’t see anything in this act that talks about landfills, environmental hazards and things that have been a real problem for my municipality in the past.

I’m glad you could put that together here.", "First of all, I would just like to point out, it’s very interesting that we’re in the middle of debating this bill, and the government has stopped debating. They didn’t consult on this bill, and now they don’t want to debate on this bill. I think that’s a totally sad state of affairs for this government and democracy, when the governing party has decided that they’ll just bring forth legislation without consultation, without debate, and vote it through. I’m pretty sure when it hits committee, not a single opposition amendment will pass. I think we’ve had maybe two that passed since we started. I just think that’s a travesty, and unfortunately, it’s too bad we’ve hit this point in democracy. Hopefully, the people of Ontario are seeing what is occurring with their democracy in this province, when they have a government that’s more focused on a federal campaign than actually dealing with the issues of the day in our own province.", "But Mr. Speaker, I digressed a bit, and I’d like to speak a little bit on Bill 73, the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act. It’s worth noting that I just mentioned the lack of proper consultation that went in with regard to developing this legislation. We’ve seen lack of consultation most recently with the Hydro One sale. We’ve seen that over 50% of Hydro One would be sold, even though it’s not a majority of Hydro One—I am not sure how that works out to not be the majority. But the constituents of this province were not consulted about this sale. It is important to note that our leader, Patrick Brown, earlier today stated that over 70% of Ontarians are against this deal. However, there’s still no consultation with the bill, and in fact, they’ve removed the Ombudsman from the process. So all of this deal going forward, the sale is not under public scrutiny. It’s not being able to reach the average taxpayer or ratepayer of what’s going to go on with this Hydro One sale, that at the end of the day, our rates are only going to increase.", "Why? Why are they rushing that? Why are they rushing Bill 73? Is there any reason to ensure that this goes through any quicker than possible? Do you not think that when you rush a piece of legislation—without consultation, without debate—and ignore the committee process by probably not listening to the opposition, you’re going to end up with errors or problems?", "Look at the Green Energy Act. They can’t say there haven’t been problems with that act; otherwise, they wouldn’t be changing the way the subsidies are ruled, or the fact that they might actually let municipalities have a say. I think the fact that they’ve totally disregarded what municipalities have had to say over the life of the Green Energy Act is probably one of the reasons why it’s been such a colossal failure.", "This government needs to slow down and do things the proper way. The best way to do it is to start to consult with people before proposing new legislation, as opposed to after. Slow and steady wins with the race, and nothing good happens when a product is rushed to market. That is the same thing that’s going to occur with this legislation.", "The Smart Growth for Our Communities Act affects municipalities, developers and new homebuyers. New homebuyers range from young people just entering the market, just by entering the workforce, to those who are retiring or moving into a new community. Buying a home and moving into a new and existing community gives one a great sense of accomplishment. It provides us with a feeling of great achievement as we settle in and build a new life. For many, building a home the first time is not a pleasant experience. One of the reasons is extreme cost with owning. Home ownership is a very rewarding experience, but it’s very, very tough to start, especially in this province.", "Ontario was a place, long ago, 15 years ago, where you could find work, raise a family and buy a house. Unfortunately, Bill 73 is not helping correct that situation, returning us to a “have” province. Bill 73 impacts municipalities in a negative way, when we need to be there to assist them as a working partner. Our municipalities are always operating on thin ice, and with this proposed legislation, it will only become increasingly more difficult to finance the new homes being built, as well as the necessary infrastructure associated with the increased population. Municipalities need support, and they are not receiving such support with this provincial government, as their concerns are not being heard.", "This bill affects the Development Charges Act. Amendments to the act would include a mandatory planning advisory committee for upper-tier municipalities. As such, it would basically remove talk from an open room back into the bureaucracy to have things decided. Instead of having open town council meetings where constituents can attend and voice their opinions, this new committee would include members of council, but only one member of the public. As we’ve seen from other things this government has done, getting the voice of one member of the public or of a group does not actually count as proper consultation. It is therefore crucial that development debate stays within open and transparent public city council meetings.", "The minister’s own mandate letter states that he must conduct a full review of the Ontario Municipal Board before making any changes; however, I feel that he has not listened to his Premier. The Smart Growth for Our Communities Act comes at a time before this review has even been conducted. Not only has this review yet to be conducted before the legislation is put through, but we have heard from many key stakeholders that the reviews and analyses have yet to be completed.", "This bill includes a number of changes to the Development Charges Act. Historically, builders paid fees to municipalities to fund infrastructure projects such as sewers, roads and water. If passed, the amendments proposed in this bill would remove that section that prevents the development charges to being limited only to those three items. Therefore, if this section were removed, development projects such as museums and galleries could be left on the bills of new homeowners, which is interesting—it’s not the entire province that is undergoing development.", "I could easily see this government, with its $10-billion deficit, $300-billion debt, and only increasing—" ],

So it’s very, very curious that they would go forward without consulting the general public and rural Ontario—and I’m sure northern Ontario as well would have the same problems.", "Just another point: Development charges in the surrounding Toronto area right now are between $30,000 and $50,000 per single-family home. Now, take that comparison to Calgary and Edmonton, which I would assume have the same type of growth areas that Toronto is experiencing, and they’re down to less than $8,000. That’s kind of disheartening for the taxpayers of the province and the home builders of the province, the fact that costs can even go higher. We’re not even competitive with other jurisdictions.", "As I mentioned earlier, as a member of a rural riding, this government has lost over 6,000 manufacturing jobs in my riding alone. It alarms me to think that a newcomer coming into our community would even be able to afford a new home to start with, or in fact move, or even have a retiree try to move into a new community to downsize, for someone actually coming in and buying their house.", "The last thing we want to see are families turned away because they’re unable to own a home. Housing and home ownership is becoming more and more of a problem within our province.", "When we look at social housing, that is also another problem. There are 165,000 families on the wait-list. I get that every day in my riding: people coming in looking for social housing, because there’s not enough housing there that’s suitable for them. This government gives a certain amount that’s spent over three years in all of Elgin county, and the projects eat it up just like that. It doesn’t even touch the wait-lists going on.", "In fact, I just want to commend one of my constituents, Jason McComb. He was a homelessness advocate and actually doesn’t own a home. He lives in a storefront in St. Thomas. He has Homeless Happens—I had him in the Legislature once a few years ago. He’s just trying to raise awareness of homelessness. He’s walking across Canada, and he’s somewhere in northern Ontario right now. I’m sure the winter is going to slow him up quite a bit. If you see him out there as he’s heading off into Manitoba, be sure to give him your best.", "I think it’s people like that who are spelling out to this government that not only is social housing an issue that’s missing, but people’s access to homes—making these changes is going to make it more difficult for people to enter the housing market. It’s going to put a burden on municipalities with their ability to actually utilize development charges that they’re going to allow them to charge, but if there’s no development, the charges aren’t going to go forward.", "Thanks for your time, Mr. Speaker.

Leamington is in a three-year experiment where they have done away with development fees. They’re not charging anything. At first blush, you would say, “That doesn’t make any sense.” But since they initiated that, Speaker, three new subdivisions are under way, are being built, are under construction. New industrial places—new commercial space—are going on in Leamington because they dropped development fees as an incentive to get people building again.", "A great idea? Some people say yes.

The CEO has been quoted as saying, “New neighbours ultimately pay every new tax generated by government. If municipalities believe that transit is the priority project, they have a responsibility to be accountable, transparent and fair in how they determine the entire tax bill that falls on the back of new homebuyers and businesses.”", "We understand that municipalities could use the extra funding, possibly using developmental charges. However, that is not the solution to the problems of the municipalities.", "I think a perfect opportunity this government has, which they should think about—the member from Haldimand–Norfolk brings it up quite often; the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke brings it up quite a bit—especially for rural Ontario and northern Ontario, is the expansion of the gas tax. However, that never really gets brought forward. Unless you have a transit system in your municipality, you’re unable to access that gas tax. Our federal cousins have made that change, and it has been expanded into municipalities that don’t have a transit system, and they’re using it for great opportunities. I think it’s a great way—if you really want to develop economic opportunities, help with infrastructure, the expansion of the gas tax is step one, and maybe we can see legislation fast-tracked on that, if they’re in the business of fast-tracking all legislation." ],

Ça me fait plaisir de prendre quelques instants cet après-midi pour vous parler du projet de loi 73, le projet de loi modifiant la Loi de 1997 sur les redevances d’aménagement et la Loi sur l’aménagement du territoire. Je voulais en parler parce que bien que le projet de loi nous parle de communautés en croissance, moi, je représente un comté où il n’y a pas de croissance. C’est la stagnation dans Nickel Belt. Il y a quelques petites parties de Nickel Belt qui sont en croissance, comme Vallée Est et Rayside-Balfour, mais la plupart des autres, qu’on parle de Foleyet ou de Gogama, de Mattagami ou de Biscotasing, de Westree, de Shining Tree ou d’Alban, on ne parle pas de croissance.", "Mais, on est en train de changer une loi qui va s’appliquer partout en Ontario, une loi qui va s’appliquer autant dans mon comté et dans le nord-est de l’Ontario que dans le restant de la province. Depuis longtemps, on sait que c’est une loi qui fait des changements à deux projets de loi, vraiment. C’est une loi qui fait des changements par rapport aux redevances d’aménagement et une loi qui change également la Loi sur l’aménagement du territoire.", "Si on parle spécifiquement de la partie sur les redevances d’aménagement, la loi est vraiment faite en sorte pour dire qu’on donne la permission d’augmenter les redevances d’aménagement afin, vraiment, d’augmenter les revenus. Mais, il faut que tu prennes en ligne de compte que dans certaines municipalités, pour s’assurer qu’il y a une croissance, parfois on va en sens inverse, et que le sens inverse a autant de bon sens dans certaines municipalités que de leur donner la permission d’aller chercher d’autres outils et d’autres fonds.", "Plusieurs des personnes qui ont parlé devant moi ont peur que si les frais d’aménagement deviennent trop élevés, ce qu’on va faire, vraiment, c’est arrêter la croissance plutôt que d’encourager les entrepreneurs à développer de nouvelles entreprises domiciliaires, de nouveaux « buildings » appartements ou même de nouveaux condos. Si les redevances sont trop hautes, ce qu’on va faire c’est qu’on va stopper ça. Mais, d’un autre côté, si la loi est faite pour aller en sens unique où la seule chose que tu peux faire est d’augmenter les frais, bien là...", "Mon collègue de Windsor–Tecumseh a donné des exemples. Dans son comté, ils ont décidé de tout simplement abolir les frais de développement et ils ont eu des résultats. Il a parlé de trois nouvelles entreprises domiciliaires qui ont vu le jour. Il a parlé d’un nouveau complexe industriel, de nouvelles places pour des entreprises, et tout ça avec une décision du conseil municipal qui était de tout simplement enlever les frais. Il a parlé également d’autres municipalités qui, elles, ont décidé de diminuer les frais de développement de 50 %, et pour ces municipalités-là, aussi, ça a été gagnant. Ça a été gagnant parce qu’elles ont été capables d’augmenter le nombre de nouvelles constructions, d’habitations et de commerces, etc., qui se sont développés sur leur territoire. Donc, avoir un projet de loi à sens unique, c’est toujours un peu problématique.", "L’autre partie du projet de loi qui parle spécifiquement de l’aménagement du territoire, ça, monsieur le Président, c’est encore plus problématique à cause de ce qui n’est pas dedans. On n’a pas souvent l’opportunité de changer des lois. Si on regarde, en ce moment, la Loi sur les redevances d’aménagement, c’est une loi qui date de 1997. Donc, ça fait 18 ans de ça. Il va probablement se passer un autre 20 ans avant qu’on fasse d’autres changements.", "Il y a une opportunité en or de s’assurer qu’on met dans le projet de loi 73 des changements à la loi qui nous permettraient de s’assurer que tout le monde a un logement. En anglais, on appelle ça « inclusionary zoning ». Puis, ce que ça fait, c’est qu’au fur et à mesure qu’il y a de nouveaux appartements qui se bâtissent, s’il y a plus de 20 appartements dans n’importe quel immeuble—donc, n’importe quel immeuble à logement qui se bâtit qui aura plus de 20 unités devra avoir une unité de logement social, de logement à prix abordable. Qu’on parle d’un condo, ça va vouloir dire que tu devrais être capable d’acheter des unités, ou si tu parles d’un appartement à louer, tu devrais être capable d’avoir un appartement à louer.", "Depuis qu’on a commencé à parler du projet de loi 73, il y a un éléphant dans la Chambre. Tout le monde le sait. On a besoin de plus de logements à prix abordable. On en a besoin dans les quatre coins de la province, que tu parles du Nord-Est, du Nord-Ouest, du Sud-Est, de Toronto ou d’Ottawa. Partout, on a besoin de plus de logement social. On a une opportunité en or, et cette opportunité-là, c’est le projet de loi 73, mais ce n’est pas dans le projet de loi.", "What I was trying to do with the 10 minutes that was allocated to me to speak about this bill is really to show that the first part, the part about the Development Charges Act—the modification to this part is really focused toward bringing new revenues to the municipality, it is really focused in the direction of improving revenue streams for municipalities, but my colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh made it clear that not every municipality believes that increasing development charges is the way to prosperity. Some have even gone the way of no development charges, and they saw the benefit of that. They saw three new different subdivisions grow that probably would have never been there. They saw a new industrial park, they saw new commercial areas, and this is with zero development charges.", "Yet the bill is written in a way that you can only see growth if you see a growth in the development charges. People in the business world, when I go to the Sudbury Chamber of Commerce, they call that red tape. They call that a step in the wrong direction. Let us who are living in those municipalities decide. Don’t set a bill that directs you into the direction of increasing those charges.", "In the second part of the bill, that has to do with the Planning Act, there is a big, big hole, and that big hole is inclusionary zoning. Throughout the province, we need more social housing. I’m sure that each and every one of us has had families in our office, often feeling very, very uncomfortable, talking to us about housing that they just can’t afford, and the hardship it brings on their families, on their loved ones and on their children because they just can’t afford it, and what they have to do without, because so much of their paycheque goes towards paying rent.", "Here is an opportunity to grow our social housing stock without having to spend a single penny from the province. Mandate, in Bill 73, inclusionary zoning, which means that every time you have construction of more than 20 units, at least one of them will be for social housing. Whether they are condos or big apartment buildings would make no difference. Every time you have 20 new units, you get one more unit of social housing. Make it the law. Make our neighbourhoods more inclusive, so that we have social housing throughout all of our neighbourhoods, so that they are there, they become available, they become accessible and they become used.", "This bill needs to be amended. The Liberals have to understand that when you make changes to a bill, when you open up a bill, you cannot let opportunities like that go by. Their member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore had a bill that did just that, and we all voted in favour of this. Let’s move on with that, Speaker." ],

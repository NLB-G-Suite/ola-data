But of course, he will be remembered for much more than that. Throughout his life, Ernest Côté dedicated himself to his country and to his fellow Canadians.", "Ernest Côté’s life of service for Canada began in the Second World War, when he joined the Royal 22nd Regiment as a lieutenant. By 1943, he was a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. In this role, Côté played a part in planning the logistics for Canada’s D-Day operations on Juno Beach. After serving for five years in Europe, Côté returned to Canada and retired from the armed forces.", "In a recent interview, Ernest’s daughter Denyse Côté said her father “looked at his career as being a career of service, I think. He was serving Canada.”", "This career of serving Canada continued for Côté when he returned from World War II. After risking his life for our country, our values and our people, Côté went to work in public service. He joined the Department of External Affairs, where he enjoyed a 30-year career. Some of his notable accomplishments included serving as Deputy Solicitor General from 1968 to 1972, representing Canada at the early meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and helping to draft the charter of the World Health Organization.", "In the early 1970s, he served as Canada’s ambassador to Finland until he retired in 1975. But of course retirement didn’t stop Côté from keeping involved. Côté travelled to France last summer to mark the anniversary of D-Day. He was also one of the 50 recipients of a flag from the Prime Minister on flag day for his tremendous life of service to Canada.", "In his personal life, Côté married the late Madeleine Frémont. They had four children: Michel Frémont-Côté, Benoit, Denyse and Lucie. It was his family who were with him last week when he passed away at the age of 101.", "While many of us never met Ernest Côté, we are all familiar with the sacrifices he made, the meaningful work he did and the tremendous legacy he leaves behind.", "It’s truly an honour today to be able to join all the parties in this Legislature to pay homage to an individual who dedicated so much for all of us." ],

Côté a, tout au long de sa vie, donné de sa personne. Il s’est donné à son pays dans l’armée canadienne, comme mentionné par la première ministre, et comme haut fonctionnaire et diplomate. Il s’est aussi donné à l’éducation comme gouverneur de l’Université d’Ottawa, puis comme l’un des régents de l’Université de Sudbury. Il s’est donné à sa communauté comme ardent défenseur du français, mais aussi du bilinguisme. Il disait que posséder les deux langues officielles, c’est de devenir quelqu’un de plus complet.", "Pour finir, je tiens à partager mes condoléances les plus profondes à sa famille, qui lui a permis de tant se donner.

The boldness, the audacity and, frankly, the clarity of those words still echo around the free world even today as the clarion call for the brave and the courageous.", "Many young Canadian men answered that call between 1939 and 1945. They would become known as Canada’s greatest generation. They built our country. Because of them, Canada came of age as a nation.", "Ernest Côté was born in Edmonton, a lawyer and a French Canadian soldier with the famed Montreal-based Van Doos—was one of them.", "After graduating from Laval, Ernest Côté left for England as a lieutenant with the Royal 22nd Regiment just months after being admitted to the bar in Alberta. Eventually he would be in charge of logistics as Canada prepared for the invasion of Normandy on the beach of Juno, one of our greatest military accomplishments, one that still instills national pride in every Canadian.", "Mr. Côté went on to become a diplomat with external affairs and deputy minister with veterans affairs, among other government departments. He exemplified what it meant to be a Canadian public servant; a war hero who would go on to speak at the United Nations on Canada’s behalf; a governor at the University of Ottawa and a regent at the University of Sudbury. He supported the Canadian Geographic and l’Hôpital Montfort. Above all, he was committed to keeping Canada’s legacy of the Second World War alive.", "And I’m grateful he did. Let me explain. There are days when I walk into this chamber, as I know others do, feeling a bit overwhelmed; I often look to the ceiling. I think about our founding fathers and I think about those who sacrificed in our world wars and subsequent wars. I think of how small I am, and how small we all are, in the context of those giants. I think of the sacrifices of that generation to maintain peace, order and good governance.", "It’s not lost on me that we have freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of worship. We got that because of Ernest Côté’s generation. Those who fought in the Second World War, it’s important to remember, fought to either protect or to regain those freedoms.", "It’s also not lost on me that when Ernest Côté and his generation went to fight in the Second World War, this assembly was nearly homogenous. Forget the names Lisa, Christine, Andrea, Cheri, Deb or Kathleen. It wasn’t until the end of the war that there was just one—Agnes. There weren’t names like Fedeli, Yakabuski, Gretzky, Singh, Damerla or Naqvi. Ontario’s first female Premier, and the head of a government in an English-speaking world who was openly gay, would never have seemed possible.", "But because of that generation, because of men like Ernest Côté, because of their sacrifices and their valour, nothing in this country or in this province is impossible to achieve. Through them, we enjoy unlimited potential and opportunity. All we have to add is hard work and sometimes a lucky break.", "The same can be said of our friends in the press, who I’m proud are here today. The Christina Blizzards and the Martin Regg Cohns of the world are free to write their opinions, free to speak freely, free to criticize the government and, Lord knows, the opposition in recent days, because they have no fear of retribution, because of the Ernest Côtés of the world.", "Ernest Côté and his fellow soldiers fought against a vile, oppressive and hateful regime to end and defeat the Holocaust. Today, Jewish Canadians—any Canadian—need not fear their government, because people like Monte Kwinter and Gila Martow prove they can be government. That is the legacy of Ernest Côté.", "I say to this assembly—and it is an appeal—that when a Canadian veteran or a soldier passes, it is up to us to honour and embrace their legacy, for without them, the values, the ideals, the comforts that we cherish, yet sometimes take for granted, might not be available.", "Some might disagree, but, I respectfully suggest, look at Ernest Côté’s path. Look at those who have followed him, who still continue to fight against religious and ethnic persecution in the world, who have sacrificed to ensure that little girls get to go to school in Afghanistan and that their moms get to vote, and who have been deployed to restore self-government and freedom of the press, as is happening elsewhere in the world. In that sense, Ernest Côté’s legacy, at 101 years old, was especially profound. We, by the virtue of speaking freely in this assembly today, are part of that legacy.", "Ernest Côté died in every Canadian’s second hometown last week, in the city of Ottawa. A Canadian hero, he was mourned and is mourned by an entire nation. He was the last of the D-Day colonels. His service was marked with distinction. Until the very end, as we all know, he was gutsy.", "Though he was recently in the news for an unjust, unlawful, and un-Canadian act against him, he shouldn’t be remembered for that. Instead, he should be remembered for his resolution, for his contributions to Canada and our sovereign, and, above all, for his bravery.", "One of Ernest’s last interviews was the result of that heinous experience. Perhaps characteristically of him and his generation, he said, “I was never afraid. I was madder than a wasp. Wasps ain’t afraid; they’re mad.”", "Now, at least 70 years after Churchill’s declaration, the boldness, the audacity and, frankly, the clarity in Ernest Côté’s words still echo around this country as the clarion call for the brave and the courageous.", "On behalf of the Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus, I wish to extend condolences and thanks to Ernest Côté’s family.

Like so many of Canada’s veterans, Monsieur Côté believed in service, and his distinguished career will be remembered as one of service to Canada.", "His service to our country began when he joined the Canadian army in 1939 as a lieutenant and member of the Royal 22nd Régiment. As a lieutenant colonel, Côté served as the logistics officer with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, which landed on Juno Beach on June 6, 1944. On D-Day, Canadian Forces faced some of the stiffest resistance and yet made the furthest advances into France of any Allied units.", "Monsieur Côté believed that “D-Day was the beginning in Europe that denied the forces of Nazism and fascism from spreading to take away the freedom of all of us.”", "Following the war, Côté went on to have a distinguished 30-year career in the public service. He served in external affairs, northern affairs and veterans affairs, among other posts. He participated in the first meetings of the United Nations General Assembly, where he was involved in drafting the charter for the World Health Organization, and he would serve as Canada’s ambassador to Finland.", "Despite a very successful career as a top civil servant, he is remembered by those who met him during those years for his kindness, for always being friendly and taking the time to stop and talk with staff. He retired from public service in 1975, but he continued to serve as an example. Monsieur Côté was always a fixture at Remembrance Day ceremonies and at the Canadian War Museum.", "He believed very strongly that young people must appreciate the freedoms we enjoy. He believed that they must not be indifferent. “Young people today must know that freedom is very often under attack in non-military ways. Freedom of thought. Freedom of the press. The challenge to keep these freedoms is a very difficult exercise that young people must accept.”", "As a father of four—two girls and two boys—Monsieur Côté believed that everyone should be treated equally, and he ensured that his daughters would enjoy the same access to higher education as his sons would. His children remember him as being kind, loving, humble and private, with a deep love of his country.", "All of us in this room and everyone who has the honour to serve the people of Ontario and of Canada would do well to reflect on the service of Ernest Côté, to remind ourselves what service to our country really means, to recommit ourselves to the highest standards of service, honour and integrity.", "We may have lost a great Canadian, but we will remember him." ],

One of the most fundamental purposes is for the government to seek consent on its expenditure program.", "I’ll just read one little bit here, a short paragraph from a book that I read recently: “Under the constitutional convention of responsible government, every minister of the crown must answer to the elected Legislature for the operation of the department that he or she supervises. It is the minister that is responsible for the performance and actions (or inactions) of the unelected and therefore unaccountable civil service. The concept is applicable to all ministers of the crown, including the first minister”—an important principle for us to remember during this discussion on supply.", "Speaker, there are a host of questions that were asked of the Minister of Tourism, along with every other minister who came before the estimates committee. Many questions were posed; many remain unanswered. I have a list here of unanswered questions posed by the estimates committee that each and every one of those ministers refused or has so far not responded to. It is an arrogant display toward the Legislature when members of the official opposition ask questions of the appropriate minister during estimates, and they remain unanswered.", "Just for everybody’s recollection, the estimates committee sat in September, October and November last year. There has been plenty of time—significant amounts of time—for these questions to be responded to, and they remain unanswered.", "In the Ministry of Tourism, for example, there were 21 agencies of that ministry that had failed to deliver an annual report to the minister and to this House. One of those agencies was the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. That agency had not filed an annual report with this House for over three years. The tabling of annual reports of those agencies is a statutory obligation of the government. It was as if the minister was not even aware that he had a statutory obligation, let alone any interest or effort to bring those annual reports to this House.", "You can make excuses if you like. There is no reason why an agency of this government cannot file an annual report for over three years. What is going on? We saw that time and time again, not just with the Ministry of Tourism but with each and every ministry that came before estimates.", "We saw the same thing with expenses. There is a statutory obligation—a piece of legislation that was much ballyhooed and introduced by this present government—to ensure that public sector expenses were filed and open to the public. They’re not. We asked—we asked often—why this was.

These expenses were also demanded by statutory obligation to be not only tabled with this House but also to be on a public website so that the public could scrutinize the expenses. They’re not done. In some agencies, over a year and some even upwards of two years, where they’re supposed to be filed and made public every quarter, we had agencies that were over two years not filing their expenses—unacceptable; unacceptable in any light, in any fashion, when a government that is seeking the consent of this Legislature and, by extension, the consent of people to endeavour in a spending program refuses to be held accountable, refuses to meet its own statutory obligations.", "So it begs the question. Here we have today the House—the government—bringing forth concurrence in supply. They’re asking this House—they must ask this House—for our concurrence.

The basic reason that Legislatures today exist dates back to some 700 or 800 years ago when, back in the day, people decided they didn’t like what King John was doing and decided that they had to get some sort of rein on the monarch to be able to call his—how would you say it?—propensity for taxing people to the degree that he was.", "We all know this famous document that was drafted some years ago called the Magna Carta. What it was all about was the people—in that case, the lords and knights, because it wasn’t about the people at that point, but about the people who were sort of sub to the King—exerting some power over the King so that the King couldn’t spend the money without the appropriation of Parliament. So we find ourselves, some 700 years later, with this process in our standing orders that is called concurrence in supply, and eventually the supply bill, and most members wouldn’t know where that comes from.", "I’m going to use my time in debate to talk about the process, which is perfectly within the standing orders and allowed. As I said, originally, the nobles decided that the King’s powers had to be curbed in some way, so they decided at the time that what they would do was give Parliament the responsibility to be able to appropriate dollars. In other words, the King couldn’t just go out and tax people without actually having the approval of Parliament.", "So over a number of years—and I’m going to fast-forward this to where we are now—various Parliaments, because of different incidents that happened in England, more and more took control from the King and made it so that the Legislature actually does the approval—or, in their case, the House of Commons in Westminster; when it comes to Ontario and Canada, obviously, our House of Commons and the Legislature of Ontario.", "You look like you’re about to fall out of your seat, Chair." ],

That’s the point that I’m trying to make here.", "As I was saying, to abridge the discussion, over a succession, a number of years, what’s happened is that the federal House, or Westminster in England—that’s where most of this comes from—decided more and more over the years to withdraw the power of the crown and to put it into the House of Commons. The reason for that was pretty simple: People wanted to have a say about what was going on, not only with how much tax they were being taxed by the crown, but also what the money was going to be spent on. Over the years, our Parliament has become a much more responsible Parliament in the sense that the Parliament and the Legislatures of the land decide the measures of taxation, how much revenue is needed, and where those dollars are going to be spent—for example, within the Ministry of Tourism or any of these other ministries that are listed under this particular concurrence motion.", "Members have to take seriously what their responsibility is, and that is that the government has the right and the obligation to put forward a budget. They did so last year, and this House, by way of its majority, rejected that budget. As a result, we ended up in an election. But the process is that the government introduces a budget because they determine how much money they need to be able to operate the government and the various services, such as the Ministry of Transportation, and they need to be able to make sure that the process allows for members of this assembly on the opposition side—and government—to be able to question those particular estimates, such as the Ministry of Tourism, because that’s really what the accountability is: that government can’t just have the right to spend money, do what it wants, and have nobody know about it or nobody have a say. There has to be a process.", "The process by which we appropriate dollars in Ontario is based on the Westminster model, which is that the government proposes a budget; once they’ve proposed a budget and the budget eventually passes, as it did this summer, then the estimates are tabled. The estimates at the time—for example, the Ministry of Tourism was one of the estimates that were tabled—then go before our estimates committee, and then members of the estimates committee decide in a rotation of parties which ministry is going to get reviewed: Is it the Ministry of Transportation? Is it the Ministry of Tourism? Is it the Ministry of Finance? Which one is it?", "Then there’s an in-depth look at each of those estimates at the estimates committee, which I think is a more recent phenomenon that we have here in Ontario. That probably came around 30 years ago, where we have an actual estimates committee. Before that, the estimates were conducted by various committees based on the responsibilities of each committee. Some committees, for example, would have natural resources; another committee may have the Ministry of Tourism, so those estimates were done separately, but we opted some 30 years ago to have an estimates committee that looks strictly at estimates.", "But the point is this: By the third Thursday in November, the estimates that are not finished are deemed to have been concurred with. They’re deemed to have been done and reported to the House. We find ourselves now at that point. As of the third Thursday of November, the estimates were reported to this Legislature, and once the estimates are before us—such as the Ministry of Tourism—you then have to go through a process of accepting those expenditures. The government proposed a budget. The government passed a budget with its majority. The government then sent those estimates, such as the Ministry of Tourism’s, to the estimates committee to be reviewed. The committee did its job in reviewing estimates such as the Ministry of Tourism’s, and then it reported back to the House, because now you need to get concurrence on those estimates that have been reported back to the House.", "So we find ourselves at this point in a two-hour debate on the various ministries that are named inside this particular concurrence motion. We find ourselves now being able to deal with those particular ministries one at a time—in this case, the Ministry of Tourism. For example, in the Ministry of Tourism estimates, I’ve often felt that there is a real gem in the province of Ontario on James Bay having to do with tourism, as it approaches not just Moosonee, but it approaches Moose Factory and other communities.", "For example, one of the things that the government could have done in these particular estimates is to appropriate X amount of dollars per year for the next number of years so that the communities of James Bay can organize themselves in such a way as to be able to develop infrastructure, so that when tourists come to James Bay, they actually have some good infrastructure to be met with.", "Unfortunately, infrastructure in places like Moosonee and most of our coastal communities and most of our reserves leaves a little bit to be desired. Water and sewer systems are old, fragile and breaking. Our streets are in pretty rough shape. A municipal council or a reserve is not going to pay to pave a street when they know they’ve got to rip the pipe up, and that’s a situation that most of these communities find themselves in. Very basic dollars towards being able to fix the infrastructure in those communities would have been appropriate to be able to develop a tourism strategy—" ],

But it’s going to take some vision on the part of government to say that we’re looking at this over multiple years, because we’re talking about a fairly large investment by the time you fix roads, fix water and sewer, put some pavement on the roads, do some building of basic infrastructure to support tourism, some work on the train as it comes into Moosonee. It’s going to take a fair amount of money.", "It’s like anything else, Speaker: Build it, and they will come. But you’ve got to build it, and where we are right now, it’s not built. We have a community called Moosonee, we have MoCreebec, we have Moose Factory and we have the communities north of that, but there isn’t any integrated plan by which to develop tourism in that particular area.", "On the issue of infrastructure, I think the larger issue—and our leader Andrea Horwath has spoken to this a number of times—is that what municipalities really need is stability in knowing how much money they’re going to get over multiple years. One of the difficulties we currently have with infrastructure spending is that the government, because they love to have press conferences and say, “Hey, great. Look what we did. We gave you all this money,” doesn’t provide stable infrastructure dollars to communities over multiple years.", "Now, imagine if you’re sitting around a municipal council table somewhere in northern Ontario, southwestern Ontario, Toronto—or anywhere else, for that fact—and you’re trying to figure out what your priorities are when it comes to being able to invest in infrastructure. You’re really kind of at the whim of what the provincial and federal governments are going to do on infrastructure. If you know that water is the big thing, then you put forward water projects. If it’s arenas, then you put forward arena projects. All of those things are issues that municipalities need to deal with, and they’re all equally important—making sure the arena roof doesn’t leak. Unfortunately, we just saw a case where there was an arena—I’m not exactly sure where—and the snow load collapsed the roof.", "We need to make sure that our infrastructure is safe, and the best people to make those kinds of decisions, I think, are at the local level. We’ve argued for a long time that we should be saying to municipalities across this province, our partners, “Here’s how much money you’re going to get each and every year for the next five years,” so that councils can go back to their council meetings, sit down, decide what their priorities are and say, “We know we’re at least going to get this kind of money. We can plan year one, year two, year three, year five what we’re going to do when it comes to planning for infrastructure in our communities.”", "I think that’s something that has been lost on the government. Yes, we have our gas tax, which is helpful—there’s no question. Only those communities that have infrastructure, when it comes to transit, are the ones that get the lion’s share of it, but it’s something. So you know you’re going to get some money. But for most communities, it really is a problem because you don’t have a good enough barometer on knowing how much money you’re going to have. You may have something right now that has to be done—let’s say a water or sewer project that needs to be done because of breakage and whatever may have happened. Then, at the same time, you’ve got to start planning for the arena; you’ve got to plan for the pool; you’ve got to plan for municipal streets. You’ve got all kinds of plans that you have to plan for when it comes to infrastructure spending. So I would much prefer the government to have decided, yes, we’re going to do infrastructure spending in one way that allows municipalities to be able to plan.", "With that, Speaker, I wanted to put that on the record.

The fall economic statement had some broad gestures. The finance committee has travelled around the province. We heard from Ontarians from the north, the south, the east, the west. They have a lot of ongoing issues which are systemic in nature and very much tied to the way that funding flows from this place and the priorities of this Legislature, and, in particular, of this government. Then we have the estimates, where we sort of peel back the layers, of course. That was an interesting process as well. I do like that.", "From my perspective, the most accurate financial data that comes out of the Ontario Legislature is the public accounts, because that’s the money that has already been spent. Those are real dollars. As many of you know, we have a $12.5-billion operational deficit, which makes this concurrence-in-supply motion all the more important.", "On the issue of infrastructure, I’ve been carrying around the 2014 Auditor General’s report—it’s my new little mini bible—because it does raise some very serious financial issues, particularly on infrastructure. She highlighted that there are inconsistencies in the way that infrastructure is funded in this province. It’s unfortunate the supply motion is crafted this way, because infrastructure pins so many things together. It ties the economy. It ties the productivity of this province. There are environmental considerations to the way infrastructure funding flows. And yet here we have this Auditor General’s report, which has indicated those inconsistencies that I referenced around funding to the tune of $8.2 billion in additional funding that flowed from the provincial treasury over the last 74 public infrastructure projects.", "She found—this is on page 197—that “where Infrastructure Ontario concluded that private-sector project delivery” under the AFP and procurement “would be more cost effective, we noted that the tangible costs (such as construction, financing, legal services, engineering services and project management services) were estimated to be nearly $8 billion higher than they were estimated to be if the projects were contracted out and managed by the public sector.”", "What was really interesting is that before Christmas, of course, we challenged the government on this report, as we should. It’s our job to do so. The Minister of Economic Development came back and said, “We’re the best in the world for infrastructure funding.” I don’t think spending $8.2 billion that the province doesn’t have is anything to brag about, I must tell you.", "But on the financing costs, these are not questioned. Financing costs under public infrastructure over the last 74 infrastructure projects are indicated on page 203 of the Auditor General’s report. Financing costs under a public sector comparator were $500 million. Financing costs under the AFP and the procurement process were $7 billion. That’s a difference of $6.5 billion. These are real numbers. So when we get a chance to go to estimates, we’re going to be able to challenge the Minister of Finance in a very real way around these numbers.", "The ancillary costs are not that different; there’s a difference of $400 million. But the big difference is the retained risks. This is where she found that there was no empirical evidence. So in a public sector comparator, Infrastructure Ontario made the case that those 74 infrastructure projects would have a retained cost of $18.6 billion, and then AFP would be only $4 billion. This is the number in question, Mr. Speaker, because this is the number which she basically says there’s no empirical evidence for. In fact, this is essentially a made-up number.", "As we discuss the supply motions in this House, as we discuss where money is going and where money is not going, this is a huge red flag for us on this side of the House, for New Democrats, a long-standing issue for us; and it should be of great concern to the government, because if there was ever a government that was looking to save money and to direct money where it was going to make a difference, through the infrastructure ministry, then you would be taking a second look at it. Instead, that’s not what we found at all. That’s not what we heard from the Minister of Economic Development. He thinks they’re the best in the world—and therefore it must be true.", "I do want to say—because I think it’s very clear that there are serious issues around trust and the way the funding does flow—that the Auditor General also raised a very serious issue—very serious, Mr. Speaker: the conflict-of-interest declarations around how these contracts are established. She found that, “According to the agency’s policies, each participant involved in evaluating submissions received in response to the request for qualifications/proposals that the agency issues for AFP projects is required to sign a conflict-of-interest declaration and disclose any relationships with any entities identified in the submissions. Evaluation teams typically include staff from Infrastructure Ontario; project sponsors; and various legal, financial, technical and cost consultants.” Of course, that’s why it costs so much. “However, in a sample of projects that we reviewed, Infrastructure Ontario was unable to provide us with signed conflict-of-interest declarations for a number of the participants involved in evaluating submissions, both at the request-for-qualifications and request-for-proposal stages.”", "So, Mr. Speaker, on the Ministry of Infrastructure funding, how funding is flowing out to the province—because this government has said they’re going to spend $130 billion over the next 10 years. But if you carve off almost 25% of that, you are not going to see the jobs; you are not going to see the needed infrastructure; you are not going to close the gap on transportation, on transit ways, on water systems, on sewers, on storm water. It just isn’t going to happen. If the government cares about infrastructure in the province of Ontario, they will rethink public-private partnerships in this province." ],

But here, we really don’t spend that much time.", "Anyway, I’m pleased to have a chance to talk about the Ministry of Transportation. Certainly, one of the biggest issues for me, in the riding of Parry Sound Muskoka, in the last couple of winters has been winter road maintenance. In fact, I have now presented some petitions with 2,950 signatures with regard to winter road maintenance. Just to give a little history on that, I’ve been elected for 13 years now, and in the first 10 years I hardly had a complaint about winter road maintenance. At that time, there was a system in place called managed outsourcing. I think “managed” is the key, where the Minister of Transportation took an active role in sending controllers out to look at winter road conditions and actually managing the private sector contractor who had the contract, directing them on when to put sand and salt down and, importantly, paying for the cost of that sand and salt so it didn’t come out of the contract price.", "We’ve now switched, in the last couple of years—and it would be interesting to know whether it’s saving money for the government or not, especially if you take into account all of the accidents that have been occurring and the big increase in accidents and, I would think, potential liability as well. They have a system called an area maintenance contract. The key difference is that the private sector contractor is now responsible for everything, so they send their own people out to patrol the roads and decide themselves on when and how much to sand and salt etc. I can say that, whereas in the first 10 years I was elected, I might get one or two complaints in a year about road maintenance, in the last couple of years it has been a daily thing. Obviously, it’s important to the people in my area and, I’m sure, across the province or I wouldn’t have had so many people sign the petition that I’ve been putting forward. In fact, I went to Huntsville a couple of weeks ago for two hours just to provide the opportunity for people to sign the petition, and 320 people came in in two hours.", "I think we need to look at what was working, and the managed outsourcing system did work. The last couple of years, it has been a little scary out there at times; just very inconsistent conditions. Even if you get dry pavement on one section of highway, you just never know when you’re going to run into glare ice. I’ve certainly experienced that myself. I’ve had cars on secondary highways spin out of control in front of me. I’ve seen Highway 11 closed this year a few times because the transport trucks were stuck on it because there wasn’t any sand on the road south of Gravenhurst.", "When I did the petition-signing in Huntsville, virtually every person that came in, of those 320 people in two hours, had some personal story. I talked to somebody in the resort business who manages resorts and has to work in Toronto and was considering moving out of Huntsville because of the risk of having to do that trip every week.", "It’s a big issue, and I’m trying to make a positive suggestion to go to a system that did work and that has a proven track record." ],

Of course, the government had proposed originally to invest almost two thirds of the funding for that infrastructure project, that transit project. That did not happen.

The Ministry of Transportation was responsible for the planning and the dispatching of winter road maintenance plows, salt trucks etc. We had a mixed system, where 50% of the plows were private and 50% were ministry. The idea was that if you needed more plows because it had snowed, you’d call in the contractors, and you didn’t pay them when you didn’t need them. The Conservatives decided: “Let’s only have private plows,” so they got rid of the MTO plows, and the Conservatives went to where it was all private plows.", "The member from Parry Sound–Muskoka is perfectly right: That particular model allowed the ministry to manage when the salt truck was going to be on the road, what the circuit times were going to be etc.", "I remember that the members of the Liberal opposition, in the days of Mike Harris, got up in this House and they howled. They howled. They sounded more left-wing than the NDP. They kept on saying, “Boy, when we get to government, we’re going to fix this, because it’s terrible that Mike Harris has privatized winter road maintenance.”", "They get to power, the Liberals, and they out-conservative the Conservatives, because now what they’ve done is they’ve privatized the entire system. They didn’t just privatize the rest of the plows. They privatized the people who go out and do the dispatching. They privatized the people who do the patrolling. They privatized the engineering. Everything has been privatized. So the Liberals went further than the Conservatives themselves were able to go.", "If I was a Conservative, I’d be upset—very upset—that I’d been outflanked on the right by the Liberal Party.

This government—and I did sit through the estimates committee—came out and brought a brand new program and said, after delaying it a number of times, “We are confident that this is going to be fine. We’re going to roll this out, and there’s not going to be anything. It’s going to be a seamless transition.” Mr. Speaker, I’ll bring to your attention that they have already had to dump an additional $16 million into this program. That wasn’t in the estimates discussion we had. There was nothing in estimates that brought up this $16 million, and that is to bail out municipalities who they have put in jeopardy due to stress on their staff, overtime and all of the problems with the minor glitches that the minister and the Premier both continue to allude are all that is wrong with the SAMS disaster.", "We don’t know whether that $16 million was one-time or what that number may balloon to. We also heard an estimate once upon a time that a gas plant was going to cost us $40 million as taxpayers, and that was $1.2 billion, so we can talk about estimates.", "They’ve also just recently hired—they’re now trying to use the terminology “third-party adviser,” which we all know is just a high-paid consultant. We don’t know what the estimate of that amount is, and we don’t know what the estimate of that is going to be down the road, but what we do know is that there are going to be huge amounts of costs to the taxpayers of Ontario.", "These are the constant things. When I went to estimates—that was my first opportunity to be in estimates—we asked very clearly about a number of different questions. When I was back, I was doing some more stuff on the Family Responsibility Office, with my colleague Mr. Michael Harris from Kitchener–Conestoga. This question was on November 4, 2014, and he’s still awaiting a reply: “Could you provide the committee with an updated chart of staffing at the FRO comparable to the breakdown of the 2010 annual report of the Office of the Auditor General of Ontario?” That’s still outstanding, Mr. Speaker.", "Again, my good colleague Mr. Michael Harris from Kitchener–Conestoga: “Can you provide the committee with updated data on total phone calls, answered calls, failed calls and the percentage of total calls comparable to the chart in the 2010 annual report?”", "Myself, from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound: “Can you provide the committee with the number of vehicles impounded and licences removed in the last two years?” We’re still waiting on those answers, Mr. Speaker. It’s about accountability and estimates.", "Again, my colleague Michael Harris from Kitchener–Conestoga: “Can you provide this committee with a breakdown of the $2.1 billion in arrears reported in the Auditor General’s 2012 annual report?”", "And again, still with FRO, I asked the question: “What are the average arrears and average cost per FRO case? What are the plans to reduce the FRO caseload? What are the costs, and the return on these costs, for the Good Parents Pay website?”", "These are things that my colleagues across the province are hearing, and we’re asking for simple answers to ensure that we know where that is coming from. We want to know where every dollar given by the taxpayer is spent, and whether it’s providing true value to the taxpayer. I don’t think that’s too much to ask; in fact, I think that’s a pretty fundamental responsibility of all of cabinet and this government: to answer to the great people of Ontario.", "In developmental services, I asked, “How many people are being served by the $810-million funding announced for developmental services? How long are the wait-lists (by riding)?” Mr. Speaker, sadly, I’m still waiting for that. Again, there are people who are in need out there.", "You come to estimates expecting the government to have a game plan. You expect them to have an estimate and a game plan, and you would hope that they have targets for each dollar they’re spending, because Lord knows they are very good spenders, but what we want to see is the outcome on the other end. What’s the value to the taxpayer?", "On transfer payment agencies, my colleague Mr. Randy Hillier from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington asked a question, and this was on November 5, 2014: “Can you tell me how many transfer payment agencies are receiving less than $120,000? How many employees are tasked with monitoring and evaluating the efficacy of transfer payment agencies and the funds spent? Could we get a couple of examples of audited financial statements and the tools for following up? Can we have information on the numbers of people who received services from transfer payment agencies last year?”", "I think those are all valid questions. I think the taxpayers of Ontario want to know that type of information. It’s a valid question. I’m not certain why a minister, to this day, has not answered those questions that I’ve cited here. There are a number of others, but I’ll leave some of those for some of my colleagues to question as well.", "I’m going to come back again for a little bit to SAMS. This was one of those ones that we were assured, especially after the eHealth boondoggle and that rollout of a program that we know has not provided any value to the taxpayer of Ontario—again, a billion-dollar boondoggle.", "We take our job and our responsibility as opposition to ask those questions in a very diligent manner, a very practical manner, to ensure that we are in fact holding the government to account. They have an accountability requirement. They have a responsibility to the taxpayer, and we are doing that to ensure that the taxpayer has confidence in what this government is doing, or what any government is doing. They have to have a sense that their money that is being taxed is coming forward to pay for the products, services and programs that the people of Ontario so richly deserve.", "SAMS has been nothing but a boondoggle. We’re cutting millions of dollars on front-line care, but we’re finding $16 million at the drop of a hat to fix an administrative glitch that they knew about. I’m not certain they even know how to fix that glitch, which is sad in its own case. That’s $16 million that could have gone to the front line of health care, to those people in need, to those less fortunate in our society who are struggling with the high cost of energy—the highest in North America, I might add—under this government. They’re struggling with affordable housing; there are shortages all over the province in that area. They’re struggling with being able to pay their basic bills.", "The $16 million—that’s just a start. We have no estimate of what that number might balloon to, and it scares me to think, after watching the gas plant boondoggle in this House, where we may go with that one. It scares me to no end that we’re talking again about—there was no estimate for this third-party consultant, third-party adviser, whatever they want to call it. You can call it whatever name you wish. It’s like suggesting that a revenue tool is not a tax.", "The people of Ontario get to it very quickly. They understand, and what they’re wanting is for people to be able to have a plan in place, know that it’s going to work and see what the valuable outcome to the people, at the end of the day, is.", "The human and social cost to the spending by this government—decreasing ODSP income supports for families, thus forcing people into a life of poverty through no fault of their own. They’ve cut the community start-up benefit. Again, not any of that was discussed, I believe, in estimates committee.", "In my backyard, we have a program called the Restorative Care Unit at the Chesley hospital. It costs $810,000 a year to run that program, and they’ve cut that. Yet they can find $16 million to fix their glitch, their error, on the SAMS program. There was no estimate of that. There was no estimate that I was aware of when I went to those committees that there were going to be those kinds of cuts coming. I struggle sometimes with how they can’t find money for home care for our frail seniors and yet they can find this to fix and to cover up what I would suggest is a significant boondoggle that’s impacting the most unfortunate people, less fortunate people, in our communities.", "You couldn’t find money for developmental services, which resulted in 21,000 people now languishing on a wait-list. That’s deplorable that they didn’t have that, again, in their estimates and how they were going to address that. They need to ensure that they have estimates that are going to be practical and realistic and they’re going to be able to find a way to do that.", "They’ve cut programs like the beloved ranger program, the oldest youth work program in Ontario.", "This is billions of dollars that have been wasted, money that could have paid for critical care to help save the lives of Ontarians, lifted them out of poverty and provided the myriad of critical services they need and deserve.", "Just this weekend I noted that there was about $3.5 million given to stop the closures of some hospitals in the riding of Mr. Rinaldi, Quinte–West.

Right now it’s estimated at $16 million, but you know that you have to challenge those numbers.

It’s a little scary because it points out that the global adjustment cost, which is now 7% of people’s hydro bills, has gone up 1,200%, from 0.4 cents a kilowatt hour to 5.5 cents a kilowatt hour. It’s going to be a total of $50 billion from 2006 to 2013—$7.7 billion in 2013 alone. Huge, huge numbers, and people are paying for it on their hydro bills. The only people who actually see it have signed a fixed contract. I had a senior come in.

For example, infrastructure saw a revenue decrease of $60 million, but increased spending of $85 million.", "The deficit actually grew last year and is projected to grow again this year, despite the Liberals using a contingency reserve fund of $1 billion. We expect the government to do that again this year, even though they’ve already grabbed $300 million from the reserves, as indicated in the fall economic statement.", "This government talks about restraint, but Ontario’s deficit is bigger than all other provinces combined, and they’ve added $10 billion in new spending in the past two years. In fact, three other provinces actually turned to surplus this year. Even if you remove those three from the calculation, Ontario’s deficit is still larger than all other provinces combined.", "Speaker, let’s look at what was actually in the public accounts. I refer to page 23 of the public accounts. It talks about balancing the budget and it talks about Ontario’s record against deficit targets. Page 23 starts with a chart showing a deficit projection of $24.7 billion in 2009-10. It still talks about these numbers and it says, “Because of the better-than-planned results ... Ontario’s accumulated deficit is $25 billion lower....” It also says that it’s because of “careful financial management.” But let’s get to an actual Ministry of Finance document that we revealed. You can find that, of course, Speaker, in Focus on Finance.", "In one briefing document prepared as “confidential advice to cabinet,” senior financial officials repeatedly warned that the economy has not regained full strength. In fact, they refer to this $24.7-billion deficit. They say that it’s a benchmark of projects. It is complete fiction, Speaker.", "Here’s their quote: It “was never a real expectation” and was a “deliberate” policy to project a “worst-case” outcome. In other words, it was deliberately misleading. They admit that “The path to balance was then drawn from there, assuming a straight-line trajectory,” and it was assumed that spending would be constrained to whatever it takes to hit the target. In other words, somebody started with a made-up number—in their own words, “It was never a real expectation”—drew a straight line to zero and said, “These are now our deficit numbers for the years remaining.” It’s fiction, Speaker, complete fiction in their own public accounts document.", "Let’s talk about their next document, the fall economic statement. Despite warnings last year from the Bank of Canada that growth would fall short, this Liberal government ignored those warnings, and as a result, they ended up with a $500-million revenue shortfall. Only four months after publishing the number, they had to correct it by $500 million. That’s how off these guys’ estimates are.", "Speaking of warnings, the Auditor General, in her 2014 report, warned the Liberals about the possibility of further credit rating downgrades because of their laissez-faire attitude towards our debt. A week after her report, Fitch cut the government’s rating. Moody’s sent a shot across their bow just last week, voicing their doubt about the numbers. In fact, here’s the Moody’s quote: “Ontario’s persistently large deficits, and its tendency to delay the most significant cost-cutting measures towards the latter years of its projected timeline for returning to a balanced budget, increase the risk that the province will be unable to achieve its goal” of balancing by 2017. Speaker, the experts don’t believe their numbers and we don’t either.", "Here’s what else the Auditor General had to say on page 5 of the annual report: “Our key commentary in chapter 2 is on Ontario’s growing debt burden.” She talks about how the government “should provide more information on how it plans to achieve its longer-term objective of reducing its net debt-to-GDP ratio.” Remember, when these guys took office, the net debt-to-GDP was 27%. Today, it’s forecasted to reach a high of 40.5%.", "According to the auditor, “The net debt-to-GDP ratio is a key indicator of the government’s financial ability to carry its debt relative to the size of the economy.” It’s going the wrong way. Our deficits are going the wrong way—$9 billion, $10 billion, $12 billion. The debt-to-GDP is going the wrong way.", "We also have once-secret documents from the Ministry of Finance that show the government had a $4.5-billion gap prior to the 2013 budget that, again, they hid from the public. I will talk about that gap here in their own words. In late February 2013, the Ministry of Finance identified that the government is at least $3.5 billion off the pace needed to balance the budget. These are in these once-confidential documents that we were able to get out through the gas plant scandal committee, actually. It states that the fiscal gap stems from “existing ministry results-based plans falling short of managing within allocations.” In other words, they just spent $3.5 billion more than they took in. In fact, the number was revised to $3.6 billion.", "When the cabinet was aware of this, they went on a retreat. They went on a retreat, and instead of taking decisive action to reduce this massive hole in their budgeting, cabinet discussions actually resulted in an increase to the shortfall. They ended up with a $4.5-billion gap.", "This is interesting because in a document dated May 2, the day the budget was presented, it shows that the multi-year expense plans remained largely unchanged. That means the government knew when it presented its budget—it said one thing, but knew they were $4.5 billion worse off. They publicly insisted they were “on track to balance the budget,” yet the very day before, they knew they were $4.5 billion further away from ever balancing the budget. They say one thing, but do the complete opposite.", "We haven’t even touched the scandalous waste of this government yet, the $1.1 billion on the gas plants scandal, the $8 billion in wasted money on infrastructure procurement, the $1 billion on eHealth, the $1 billion on Ornge, the $400 million on the MaRS scandal; and $1 billion over budget on smart meters, which has led ratepayers to pay billions and billions of dollars to sell off surplus energy.", "Speaker, considering the fact that we’ve got a minute and a half left to talk about the truth versus made-up numbers, I want to talk again, back to public accounts—their own book. Speaker, you keep hearing these guys across the aisle continue to say they got $640 million less from the feds this year. But their own public accounts document of 2013-14, on page 70, shows us that the actual money received from the federal government was $21.661 billion. In 2013-14, a year later, the actual was $22.277 billion. You hear from them that they got $640 million less, but the truth, the actual fact from their own Ministry of Finance—" ],

I remember thousands of people out on that front lawn. Perhaps you’ll remember it as well, because you may have been here. I think they lit an effigy of him on fire when they made 5% cuts. This government has 6% cuts in every ministry, and the way it was reported afterward was really interesting, I’m sure you’ll agree. The media deemed it an austerity budget after the fact.", "What’s going to be interesting with the supply motions in these various ministries going forward, quite honestly, is that this is not sustainable. This government is making decisions around funding, and their priorities are completely out of whack. We’ve talked about a culture of wellness and well-being in the health care sector, around early intervention and prevention, which is a smart investment that they refuse to listen to.

So I’m proud to speak to this very important component of the debate here in this Legislature.", "We just heard from a number of members opposite about the importance of focusing on facts. I don’t want to spend a lot of time there, but I do want to mention a few quick items, if I may. The member opposite from the PC caucus talked about the federal government. The fact is that Ontario receives $11 billion less than it pays to the federal government. That is a fact.", "The other piece: He talked a lot about economic growth, and I just want to address one issue here. I was just provided with a document from the member for Ottawa–Orléans, prepared by the Royal Bank of the Canada, that I think is quite interesting. I won’t go into the details, but ultimately, what it talks about is that they are projecting that Ontario will lead GDP growth among all provinces in Canada. That’s the kind of economic planning and outlook that I think we need to be talking about, and those are the facts that we should be focused on.", "Mr. Speaker, a number of us here in this Legislature are relatively new. I just want to take a minute to give some quick background, for those of us in the Legislature, but also for the folks at home who are watching, particularly my constituents in Etobicoke Centre, on what it is that we’re debating here, what the concurrence in estimates means.", "Concurrence really represents the Legislature’s approval for the estimates for a fiscal year. In this case, we’re actually discussing the concurrence for the 2014 fiscal year. Concurrence is required for all ministries and offices that have been selected for review by the Standing Committee on Estimates. Estimates of ministries and offices not selected by the committee are deemed concurred by the Legislature. In this case, the committee selected 10 ministries and offices for review, and we’ve had debate on a number of those already.", "On November 27, 2014, the Standing Committee on Estimates filed its report on its review of these estimates with the assembly, and so the assembly’s concurrence on estimates, which we are debating today, represents the approval of these selected ministries’ and offices’ estimates.", "The Supply Act, which many in this Legislature know about and some of my constituents would know about as well, would be introduced following orders in concurrence in estimates and, if passed, would represent the final statutory authority for spending by the government and this assembly.", "Today’s discussion and the ultimate vote are really important, because they’re important steps in approving government spending for the past fiscal year, which actually ends later this month.", "I just want to take a moment, as we’re talking about the Ministry of Finance, to talk about and remind members where we are in the fiscal cycle. Estimates for the government ministries and offices, volume 1, were tabled in the Legislature on July 7, 2014, and volume 2, for legislative offices, was actually tabled earlier today.", "The estimates set out a comprehensive account of the government’s intended expenditures for the fiscal year and include details of the spending plans that were presented in our government’s 2014 budget. As we near the end of this fiscal year, we’ll soon be introducing the Supply Act, should concurrence in estimates be reached. So today’s concurrence in estimates discussion is really important, as I said at the beginning, because it’s required to move forward in finalizing the review of estimates that has taken place.", "The Supply Act is required every fiscal year, to provide the final approval and legal authority for all spending for the year. It does not seek any new spending, but it does authorize expenditures as reflected in the estimates. The reason this debate is so important is because today’s concurrence in estimates must be obtained before the Supply Act can be introduced.", "This act, if passed, would constitute our final authorization by the Legislature of the government’s spending program for this fiscal year and give the government the authority to finance its programs and honour its commitments, the commitments that the people of Ontario voted for when they elected this government. That includes spending on a range of important priorities, including health care, education, supporting our most vulnerable citizens, and growing the economy. That’s why reaching concurrence in estimates, again, is so important.", "I’d like to talk a little bit, as we’re talking about the estimates for finance, about how the Ministry of Finance’s work, particularly in fiscal planning and economic planning, has impacted Ontarians over the past year.", "On July 14, the government passed the Ontario budget. The budget laid out a plan for Ontario, as you know, Mr. Speaker, with support for job creation and a more secure future for our province and our people. The government’s plan did a range of things. One of the things that I think is so important, as we think about what that plan did, was what it did to support our economic growth and job creation.", "I mentioned earlier how some economists are already predicting that Ontario will have some of the strongest growth in Canada, amongst the Canadian provinces, in the coming year. But I’d like to highlight some of the steps that our government has taken, as part of the Ministry of Finance, to do that.", "One of the things that the Ministry of Finance has done is it created a 10-year economic plan in the last budget. That provides the tools for Ontario to seize opportunities to grow the economy and be competitive on the global stage. Of course, we all know that there’s fierce competition for global investments, but to help secure the investments, one of the things the Ministry of Finance has done is ensure that we have a competitive tax system. We have to make sure that our taxes are competitive so that we can attract investment to our province.", "The other parts of this plan are that we reduced energy costs for business; we cut red tape, which is so important and something that I hear a lot about in my constituency; and we provided targeted investments to support businesses, particularly in key sectors where we know that there are job opportunities, where businesses will invest and create jobs for all Ontarians. This is, of course, a key component. Job creation is one of those key components that were part of the budget and part of the work of the Ministry of Finance and funded by those estimates.", "The other thing I’d like to mention is part of that fiscal process and what was done not just in the past, but into the future. We talked about job creation in the past and going forward, and I’ve talked about economic growth going back and into the future, but I also want to talk about the fact that we’re not only making a difference in the lives of citizens today, but we’re also improving the futures of our children and grandchildren. We’re doing that through a range of measures, and I’ll just take a couple of minutes to refer to what I’m talking about.", "First of all, to help accommodate population growth and the demands on infrastructure that come with it, the Ministry of Finance called for and planned for investments of $130 billion in public infrastructure over the next 10 years. I know that our Minister of Transportation, who is here with us today, is leading that process; I’m incredibly pleased with the work he’s doing, and proud of the work he’s doing on behalf of our government.", "Of that investment that the Ministry of Finance laid out, $29 billion is dedicated funding for public transit, highways and other priority infrastructure projects across our province. This will impact people in every riding across Ontario, and will of course, if I think about my riding of Etobicoke Centre, help to address congestion—particularly, in part, in the GTA and in the Hamilton area—through investments in roads, bridges and other infrastructure.", "This is something that people in Etobicoke Centre speak to me about regularly. When I think about the priorities I hear from my constituents, this is one of the issues that they talk about a lot, this issue of making sure that we’re continuing to invest for the future in building the infrastructure that we need to support our economy and quality of life. This is all part of the Ministry of Finance’s fiscal plan.", "To finance that, what the Ministry of Finance has done is, they moved forward on a plan to unlock the value from sale of our shares of General Motors and certain other real estate assets that we have. That’s a key function of the Ministry of Finance, and something that’s part of the work that the ministry has done to support that long-term plan to support Ontarians into the future.", "The other thing I want to mention as part of the Ministry of Finance’s work is the launch of the green bond program. This is also just an example. On its own, it’s one measure, one piece of the puzzle, but what I do know is that there was strong demand for the first issue of those bonds, with orders approaching $2.4 billion from investors in Canada, the United States, Europe and Asia. What this does is, it signals the confidence of investors in Ontario, the fact that people are willing to buy these bonds and support the infrastructure plan that the Minister of Transportation and others are leading in our government.", "I’ve talked about the importance of positioning Ontario for long-term success. Obviously as a government we have a responsibility to support people in every stage of our lives, and that is what this government has been doing for many years and will continue to do. I mention this because I think that, as we think about what the Ministry of Finance’s role is, the focus tends to sometimes be very much on fiscal affairs; fiscal affairs are obviously a critical component of what the ministry does, but it’s also about fiscal planning and planning for our future.", "We talked about transportation. I’ve talked about job creation. Another piece is poverty reduction. Of course, we all know that the Poverty Reduction Strategy is an important component of the fiscal plan, something that the Ministry of Finance has collaborated with other ministries on to put together. Since launching the Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2008, about 47,000 children and their families were actually lifted out of poverty, and many others were prevented from falling into poverty in the past six years, something that I’m very proud of—and that I know many members on this side are very proud of.", "This year alone, the Ministry of Finance allocated more than $1 billion in the Ontario Child Benefit, and that budget included $15 billion in funding for children’s social services. I think these are all important investments, all important components of the fiscal plan, and all important elements of what the Ministry of Finance does through the estimates that we’re talking about today.", "The other thing that I’d like to mention is something that comes up a lot in my riding of Etobicoke Centre: the issue of housing. The ministry allocated $16 million over three years to create about 1,000 new supportive housing spaces and related supports to help Ontarians living with mental health issues and addictions. I hear a lot about mental health issues in my community, and our government and the Ministry of Finance have responded through their fiscal planning framework.", "The other thing the Ministry of Finance has done is provided health benefits for children and youth in low-income families to ensure that they have access to services not covered by publicly funded health care, like prescription drugs, vision care and mental health services—again, issues that I hear about regularly from my constituents. I wanted to highlight these as some of the outcomes that come from the fiscal planning process that the Ministry of Finance is responsible for.", "When I think about commitments to the future and supporting Ontario in the future—our economy—one of the things the Ministry of Finance has done is that they have also committed significant funds to ensure that we’re supporting some key priorities of this government that the people of Ontario elected us to support. A couple of those are, of course, education and health care. These are things that come up in my riding frequently. I know they come up in all our ridings frequently.", "In my community we have one of the largest, if not the largest, percentage of seniors of any riding in the province, and so investments in health care and particularly in community care are so important. Community care, of course, can provide better quality care for seniors, but what it also does is give a reprieve to families. That’s one of the things that I heard about a lot in my community: how important it was that we continue those investments in community care. That’s one of the things that the Ministry of Finance has done through its fiscal planning.", "The other piece that I’d like to mention is the investments that have been made in education. We have our Minister of Education here with us today, and I know that she’s doing excellent work in trying to make sure that we’re allocating funds to strengthening education. I know that there’s a range of aspects that the Ministry of Finance estimates have allowed the Ministry of Finance to plan for in in education, things like critical thinking, problem-solving—these are all important things that the ministry has planned for.", "Mr. Speaker, what I wanted to lastly touch on was an issue that comes a lot in my community: the issue of making sure that we’re getting value for money and managing our fiscal health. I’m proud to be working with the President of the Treasury Board on that and I’m happy to say that we’re working towards a goal of eliminating the deficit by 2017-18, in a way that’s fiscally responsible but also fair to the people of Ontario and responsible. There’s a number of components to that. Of course, I don’t have time to talk about them all now, but I just want to highlight some of the things that Minister Matthews spoke to recently when she was talking about how we’re doing that.", "First of all, we need to make sure that everyone is paying their fair share of taxes. That’s a critical function of the Ministry of Finance.", "The second thing is to make sure we’re maximizing the value for government assets—again, a key responsibility of the Ministry of Finance in collaboration with others.", "Finally, we’ve launched Program Review, Renewal and Transformation, something I’m proud to be working on with Minister Matthews. That’s fundamentally new approach to how we budget, to how we manage the taxpayers’ dollars. Basically, we’re looking at every program within government, every line item, and looking to make sure we get a maximum value for taxpayers’ dollars. When I think about the issues that came up in the campaign for me, that come up day to day with my constituents, this is one of the key issues they raised with me: “Please make sure you’re working to make sure we’re getting value for taxpayers’ dollars.” That’s a key responsibility of the Ministry of Finance, and that’s why these estimates are so important to me, because the estimates that we’re talking about approving today support that kind of planning, support that kind of work for the betterment of the people of Ontario.", "Just to conclude, Mr. Speaker, I’d like to remind members of the importance of concurrence in the estimates that we’re discussing today. Receiving concurrence would allow the Supply Act to be introduced and provide final spending authority for the fiscal year that is coming to a close.", "This is not about approving new spending; it’s about providing authority for the government to finance its programs and honour its commitments. It’s about approving spending on important priorities like schools, hospitals and income support. I urge all members to support concurrence in the estimates so that spending on important public services that the people of Ontario depend on can be approved." ],

While all of us politicians are very used to the back-and-forth of politics—we build a skin for it, as I say—many forget that our families also have to deal with this back-and-forth as well. While many of us might find that easy to deal with, it is extremely difficult for some of our families.

She’s on many community organizations. One of the things that’s very popular in my household is Theatre Cambrian. My wife was in rehearsals for this play throughout. It’s called No Body Like Jimmy, and it’s a play about the election of a state congresswoman in which my wife plays the lead role, the congresswoman. There’s nothing like giving my wife first-hand experience to bring to this role, participating in a by-election. We had great opportunities and some fun stories to share. Hopefully, she’ll be able to take this with her when the show premieres in April.", "But my wife not only has a full-time job and gives back to the community; she also has to look after my two daughters quite a bit, driving them to swimming, dancing, you name it. Those are the things our partners do while we’re here. As I mentioned Theatre Cambrian, something that is also very important to my family and my two daughters, I should mention that my two daughters just finished performing in The Who’s Tommy. I know I’m a little biased, but my two daughters actually had some phenomenal performances in that, so I just wanted to acknowledge them for that great work.", "There were so many people who were involved in that production. I should mention that all of them were volunteers and that these people volunteer their time to give back to their community. I think it’s the same with election campaigns. Everyone in this House knows well that campaigns are also not possible without strong performances and strong teams of dedicated and loyal volunteers. I was lucky to have a very dedicated and loyal team. I’m filled with gratitude for every hour they put in, for every door they knocked on and for every call they made, because this by-election wasn’t easy.", "Mr. Speaker, I don’t know if you’ve ever been involved in a by-election, but they’re quite unique. I have to tell you, having a by-election in Sudbury is unique, but having a by-election in Sudbury in January and February is even more unique. There’s nothing like getting outside and knocking on doors in minus 38 degrees Celsius. So to the core of my team and to all of the volunteers, I want to say thank you for everything you did in this campaign. I want to say thanks for being engaged in the political process and for believing in me and what we want to do for the people of Sudbury and for the people of this great province.", "I also want to thank the other candidates. They all brought forward some great ideas, and without them we couldn’t have had such a great by-election and such great debates. I also want to recognize the Progressive Conservative candidate, Paula Peroni, who ran a second time after beating cancer. I think we all need to give her a huge round of applause.", "As well, I would be remiss if I didn’t take the opportunity to thank my father for his unwavering support. I should mention that during this campaign, my father celebrated his 101st birthday.

Not only does this make our roads safer, it also creates hundreds of jobs and changes the perspective of Sudbury’s economy to the businesses in the south of this province, as then we will be connected to the 400 series of highways. And of course, investing in strategic partnerships with business in order to attract investment and compete in a global economy.", "We’re seeing those investments already, Mr. Speaker. Ontario is first in North America when it comes to foreign direct investment. Our government is partnering with businesses, large and small, in Sudbury and across the province. For example, the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund has approved over $148 million in funding for close to 900 different projects, leveraging nearly $600 million from the private sector, which shows that our economic plan is working in communities across Ontario, including Sudbury. A good example of that is that Sudbury is home to Ontario’s newest mine, Vale’s Totten Mine. It is the first mine to open in Sudbury in over 40 years. It represents an investment of $760 million, and by the time it ramps up to full production, 200 more people will have a job.", "And let’s not forget the investment of the Clean AER Project—more investment—and Glencore Xstrata and its Nickel Rim operations. Just these investments alone are not only helping Sudbury’s economy but Ontario’s economy as well." ],

They talk about how we’re seeing growth in many sectors and how others need a little bit more help. I think of the small business owner like Tay Butt, who started a small software company that now has orders for his software from all over the province. Querney business supply has been around our city for decades and is continuing to grow. Dalron Construction: John and Ron spoke to me about how they want to continue to see our city develop and how this government’s continuing investments in infrastructure, transit and health care will make Sudbury and Ontario even stronger.", "I can think of the 17,000-plus men and women who work in the mining supply and services sector in Sudbury. They all work for small and medium-sized enterprises that are making a difference, not only by creating good-paying jobs for thousands, but investing in our community—through charitable events, for example.", "Just this past weekend, I saw the Grossi family out at an event to raise money for a local charity. Not only do they own and operate Anmar Mechanical, Technica Mining and many, many others; these people also find the time to give back with more than just dollars, but also with their time.", "That is why many of these great businesses in my riding of Sudbury applaud our government’s actions when it comes to the economy. For example, the business education tax reductions have been accelerated and fully implemented for northern Ontario businesses. Businesses in my riding have benefited from a BET cut of $8.6 million or an average cut of 26.2% based on current estimates.", "So it is clear, in the by-election, that the issues of jobs, growth and maintaining our current course for recovery were a priority for the voters of Sudbury. The people of Sudbury liked our 10-year economic plan. Many of those initiatives start with the government estimates that we’re talking about today.

With that, I’m happy to rise and speak to Bill 49, the Ontario Immigration Act.", "As you know, the federal government has introduced a new Expression of Interest system that helps provinces attract the skilled workers they need and helps connect potential immigrants with jobs. I want to commend them for all the work they’ve done on that.", "For those who don’t know, the Expression of Interest program provides governments and Canadian employers access to skilled foreign workers and expedites their entry into Canada for jobs that aren’t being filled by the people already in Canada. This program will allow prospective immigrants to indicate their interest in coming to Canada by providing information electronically about their skills, work experience and other attributes. If the individuals meet eligibility criteria, they will be placed in a database so they can be matched with employers who are looking for those skills.", "The Expression of Interest program went into effect January 2015, and this bill would put the next step of that program in place for Ontario, including establishing an employer registry.", "I expect when the government gets up to speak, they will point out that the Expression of Interest program is already in place, and they will say we should rush this legislation, as was just mentioned, through the House. So before they do that, or any more of that, I would like to point out a few facts.", "First, until today, we only had one opportunity for one member of the opposition to actually speak to this bill. Secondly, although the government often forgets this, they were ones who called the election that killed the previous version of the bill. Following the election, they were the ones who waited until the end of November to introduce this one.", "We support the intent of this bill. We believe that we need to do more to attract skilled immigrants to Ontario, to ensure that they, and all Ontarians, have opportunities to succeed here and that this is a place where all parents believe their children can have a bright future. Today that simply is not the case.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to be an immigrant. I was born in the Netherlands, and I am one of 15 children. My father was a farmer in Holland, and although he was making a living, he looked at the land available and realized there simply wasn’t enough land for his children to have the same opportunities he had. The population density was so high that it would be difficult for his children to get involved in agriculture. So he packed up the whole family—there were only 14 children at the time; one came the other way—and moved us to Ontario, Canada, because he believed it was the land of opportunity.", "I just wanted to point out that we were supposed to go—and this is how attractive Ontario was—to Manitoba to help a sugar beet farmer on the farm, because we had so many farmhands that could help. In fact, that’s where our train tickets were for, but my father wanted to go to Ontario. So when the train stopped in Woodstock, Ontario, we all got off. Mr. Speaker, people believed that opportunities in Ontario were so great that we were willing to bend the rules to stay here.", "Moving to Canada, and to Ontario, was a brave decision for my parents to make. It would have been easier for my father and mother to stay in Holland with their friends and family, but they wanted a better life for their children. I’m grateful to them for making that decision, because otherwise I wouldn’t be here today. Neither would my nephew John, the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane. Welcome to Ontario, John.", "Mr. Speaker, when we arrived in Ontario, we didn’t know what to expect. Today, people have more resources, like the great website welcometooxford.ca, which helps people choosing to move to my riding. But at that time we had a few surprises. What we had heard, and what we believed, was that Ontario was a place where you could succeed if you worked hard. It was a place where there were opportunities. For many people living in Ontario, that isn’t the case anymore, and that reality is going to mean that potential skilled immigrants are going to look at places where the opportunities are better.", "One of the things that we need to recognize is that we are competing for skilled immigrants. We are competing with provinces like Alberta, who on their provincial nominee website are able to say, “Alberta’s stable economy and innovative business spirit make it an ideal place to work.”", "And we are competing against other jurisdictions. Just this weekend, there was an article in the Globe and Mail about Germany’s strategy to attract more immigrants of working age, because over the next 10 years they anticipate losing 6.7 million working-age people to retirement or to other jurisdictions. It doesn’t matter how great our immigration system is if people don’t want to come to Ontario.", "People who are emigrating today still look for many of the same things that my parents did when they chose their new home. They want a place where their children can have a better life, a place where the government is fair and laws are respected and applied equally to all, and a place where they can succeed if they work hard. Those same values are the reason I’m a Conservative.", "When my father chose to come here to Ontario, Ontario was the economic engine of Canada, but today it’s a have-not province. Our debt is so large that each man, woman and child in Ontario would have to contribute $23,000 just to pay it off. Neither of those facts will convince potential immigrants that Ontario is the place where their children can have a better life.", "In the government’s leadoff speech, it was mentioned that a ministry survey of landed nominees found that 98% of nominees with a job offer were currently working in Ontario. What they didn’t mention is that the auditor’s report found that the survey’s response rate was only 45%, and that the remaining nominees could not be contacted. How many of those people couldn’t be contacted because they’d already moved to Alberta or another province where the opportunities were greater?", "I know other speakers have already talked about the fact that between 2004 and 2013 Ontario was one of only two provinces that actually saw the number of permanent residents decline. In her recent report, the Auditor General stated, “Only half of Ontario’s new immigrants were from the economic class, compared, for instance, to 87% in Saskatchewan, 78% in Manitoba and 68% in Alberta.” When potential immigrants look for skilled employment, they must look at the fact that there are more jobs, for higher pay, with less taxes, in Alberta, and now they are also looking at the fact that Ontario is proposing to take an additional 2% of their salary for a pension program.", "Ontario should be proud that we can still boast that we are a multicultural province. I’ve listened to some of the stories that members told when speaking on this bill of emigrating to Canada, or of their parents and grandparents coming here. I think there are many places in the world that would be surprised to learn that immigrants can have that type of opportunity. But when it comes to economic opportunities, the future just doesn’t look that bright. If you want to attract economic immigrants, that needs to change.", "I think we all agree that Ontario has a skilled trades shortage. In fact, the Conference Board of Canada did a study on this issue that included a survey of over 1,500 employers. They found skill gaps in four sectors that together make up 38% of Ontario’s employment: manufacturing; health care; professional, scientific and technical services; and financial industries. Three quarters of the surveyed employers said that skills requirements in their business had increased over the past decade, and another three quarters said that they will increase further over the next decade. They estimated that the skills gap cost the Ontario economy up to $24.3 billion in forgone GDP, as well as $4.4 billion in federal tax revenues and $3.7 in provincial tax revenues, annually.", "In addition, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce found that, depending on the sector being surveyed, between 21% and 52% of employers reported difficulty hiring someone with the right qualifications. Part of the solution is matching training and education with the skills that are needed and reforming the apprenticeship ratios so more of our young people can enter the skilled trades. But the other part of the solution—and this is the part that this bill tries to address—is to attract more immigrants with those skills and ensure that immigrants who come here can use their skills.", "Mr. Speaker, this bill takes some small steps towards addressing the problem that unfortunately a number of skilled immigrants face. They arrive here ready to contribute, but their education and qualifications aren’t recognized, so they can’t work in their field. If we’re serious about making Ontario the land of opportunity again and serious about attracting skilled labour, this is a problem the government needs to address.", "If you’re going to once again become the economic engine of Canada and make Ontario a place that people want to come to, the government has to get serious about solving some of these problems, not point fingers at us because we were elected government in 1995 or the NDP because they were elected in 1990. They can’t keep blaming the federal government or municipalities. The people of Ontario expect and deserve better than that.", "That leads me to another significant problem with implementing the program. One of the major parts of this bill is putting in place a system that allows Ontario employers to connect with potential immigrants to find skilled labour they need—and that assumes that jobs are available. We support the goal of this legislation, but Ontario faces some significant economic challenges today that are going to make it difficult for this program to work as intended.", "This program works for businesses that are expanding and growing. In today’s Ontario, many businesses are in fact downsizing or closing their doors. Heinz, Kellogg’s, Hershey’s, E.D. Smith, CanGro—business after business has shut their doors. All of us have heard from businesses in our ridings that are struggling with the cost of hydro, red tape, taxes and economic challenges. All of us have heard from businesses that have been approached by other jurisdictions with attempts to get them to move. They have been offered reduced taxes, lower energy costs and even free training for their future employees. The proposed pension plan would just be one more thing that drives businesses out of Ontario.", "This legislation won’t work to help connect potential immigrants with jobs if no one in Ontario is hiring. There are already some questions about how Ontario’s immigration program has been working. Again, in her annual report, the Auditor General published the results of her audit of the provincial nominee program. For those who aren’t aware, under the provincial nominee program, provinces and territories can nominate people who meet specific local labour market needs for permanent residence. The auditor found that “between October 2011 and November 2013, about 260 approved files were flagged for follow-up. We reviewed a sample of them and noted that only 8% had” received that follow-up.", "She also found that despite public statements “that applications are processed on a first-come, first-served basis, certain applications are given priority and processed at least three times faster than non-prioritized files,” including applications where the representative was a former staff member with the program.", "The auditor also found that “Employers did not need to attempt to recruit locally for 76% of job offers made to nominee applicants....” That was one of the requirements; 76% were not required to do it.", "As well, the auditor discovered problems with staff training, partly caused by the number of temporary or seasonal workers. We know that this is a practice throughout the government. Instead of hiring full-time people, who would show up on the government documents as employees, they hire people on contracts so they can say the number of staff isn’t increasing. In this case, the result was improperly trained people making decisions that had a huge impact on people’s lives. This decision determines a person or family’s future. It’s not a responsibility that should be taken lightly or done by someone less qualified just so the government can post reduced staffing numbers.", "In this case, it may also have contributed to fraud. During her review, the auditor investigated “allegations about the program’s operation and the risk that it was continuing to consider applications from individuals and organizations who were suspected to have been involved with immigration fraud and/or illegal immigration-linked investment schemes.” It seems from her report that when staff working on the program discovered fraud, they weren’t willing to tell anyone that there was any, and there was nothing to stop those people from reapplying or acting as representatives for other applicants. According to her report, based on the recommendations from the auditor’s office, the ministry “formally referred certain case information to law enforcement in September 2014.”", "One of the things that was particularly concerning to me was that many of her findings had a common thread: When a problem was discovered, it was delayed or buried. Unfortunately, it is typical of this government that when there is a problem, their solution seems to be to hide it or blame others rather than trying to solve it.", "I want to share a few quotes from the auditor’s report: “For example, in 2013, when the team found that 38% of a sample of foreign-worker nominees who had since become permanent residents were suspected to have misrepresented themselves”—this is a quote from the auditor—“program management requested that the team not share lessons learned from the results of the investigations with processing staff, thereby missing an opportunity to educate them and enhance due diligence processes.” I want to emphasize a point there: Program management requested that the team not share the lessons learned—nothing could be further from what needs to be done.", "The auditor’s report also said: “The ministry delayed formally reporting information relating to potential abuse of the program to the federal government and the proper law enforcement agencies.” We found it and we hid it.", "And the quote goes on: “After the ministry’s program integrity team recommended that case information about applicants and applications of concern be referred to outside parties for further work, the ministry took up to 15 months to report this information to the federal government and law enforcement agencies. Furthermore, the ministry did not provide vital personal information to them, thereby potentially delaying corrective action against individuals who have been abusing the program.” These are the quotes from the Auditor General. I’m not just here supposing that’s what happened; she found that in her review.", "I want to commend the auditor for the work she does. In opposition we sometimes face challenges obtaining the information that we need and having the resources to analyze detailed financial documents, so the work of the Auditor General and her office is essential to ensuring that programs work as intended, that taxpayers receive value for money, and, in the case of organizations like Ornge, that waste and misuse of tax dollars be discovered and stopped.", "I’m pleased that the Auditor General chose to use resources of her office to investigate the provincial nominee program, and that the minister has said that some of her concerns are going to be addressed in this bill.", "As you know, I’ve asked several times in this Legislature for the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing to ask the auditor to investigate the Housing Services Corp., the organization that all affordable housing providers in Ontario are required to purchase their natural gas and insurance through.", "Like Ornge, this organization has set up multiple for-profit subsidiaries. Like Ornge, they’ve seen questionable expenses, such as the current CEO travelling to Europe seven times within 16 months. Like Ornge, we’ve seen questions about salaries. In fact, a Housing Services Corp. salary budget went from $1.25 million in 2005 to $7.5 million just seven years later.", "During a review of the provincial nominee program, the auditor was able to find the problems so they could be corrected, and we believe that she should do the same for the affordable housing money being diverted by the Housing Services Corp.", "I want to ask all members of the government side to help us ensure that affordable housing dollars go to help vulnerable people by asking the Premier and the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing to request the Auditor General to investigate the Housing Services Corp.", "Housing, as was mentioned earlier, is also important for immigrants. Without the proper housing, again, we will not attract them.", "One of the other things that is missing in this bill is a connection between encouraging immigrants to come to Ontario and ensuring they have the services they need when they get here. This goes beyond settlement services; it’s about services that they expect in their communities, such as schools for their children.", "During the ROMA/Good Roads combined conference this week, I had the opportunity to meet with a number of municipalities which are mandated to grow under Places to Grow. Many of the immigrants impacted by this bill will settle in these communities. What I heard was disturbing: One government ministry is telling them they need to expand, but other government ministries are not keeping pace with providing services and funding that they need to accommodate those people.", "In one case, the Ministry of Education actually criticized a municipality for growing and told them to stop because they couldn’t keep up with the new schools they needed. I heard from the city of Brantford. They were almost out of development land for homes or businesses. Again, the government has told them to grow, but the city says there’s no land left to grow on. They have asked the government for help in negotiating with the county, but so far it hasn’t happened.", "If we’re going to encourage people to come to Ontario, we need to ensure that they can find places to live—a house or an apartment—where there is space in the school for their children and where the local hospital can take good care of them if there is an emergency. That’s the type of planning the government should be doing.", "The Ontario my father emigrated to, the one with all those opportunities for his children, isn’t the one we have today. Instead, this government has created an Ontario where red tape and the cost of doing business often prevent those who work hard from succeeding, an Ontario where the government is the subject of multiple police investigations.", "Many people know that there is a strong Dutch community in my riding." ],

I know that we’ve indicated—I think we’ve had one speaker to the bill already in this forum—that there are some concerns. Although there is general support, there are some concerns that we’d like to see dealt with, either through debate or, obviously, through committee. Overall, I think the bill does take some very important steps to align Ontario with some of the federal immigration policy changes. These are critical steps, too, because we know that our province’s future economic prosperity is directly tied to our ability to attract the best and the brightest from around the world.", "I will say it is a shame that the government has taken so long to introduce these reforms designed to help newcomers get settled in Ontario. However, for reasons I’ll get to shortly, while this is good bill, I’m not hopeful that it will actually do a lot to attract newcomers to the province.", "As was mentioned, I am sharing the balance of the time with the member from Prince Edward–Hastings. For that reason, I’m going to focus my remarks on Bill 49 and what it means to the people who elected me to the Legislature. I can tell you that although I represent a predominantly rural riding in Leeds–Grenville, in eastern Ontario, this is a bill that promises to make reforms to immigration policy that are just as important to my riding in rural eastern Ontario as to every other corner of the province. That’s a point that needs to be made: Too often, when we discuss immigration issues, there is a tendency to think it only matters in Ontario’s largest cities and urban areas. That’s far from reality. We need to recognize that the talents newcomers have to offer are important in building prosperous futures for businesses and communities in every corner of Ontario, which includes Leeds–Grenville.", "We have a proud tradition of welcoming newcomers from around the globe with open arms. These folks have made an indelible mark on our communities, adding to the richness of our culture and our local economy.", "It’s no coincidence that one of the signature events in my riding is the annual multicultural festival held every May in the city of Brockville. For more than three decades, thousands have attended this event, which highlights our diversity and the rich tapestry of cultures that make Leeds–Grenville such a wonderful place to call home.", "I also think of my good friend Terry O’Reilly, one of the co-owners of Pricedex Software in Brockville. I’ve had many, many opportunities to tour Terry’s company. I can tell you, it’s one of the most diverse groups of employees you’ll find anywhere in the province. Terry is very proud of this. I think it’s a valuable lesson for all MPPs to remember that immigration issues aren’t just something that concern members of urban ridings.", "Frankly, that’s why it’s a shame that I suspect we’ll see the government soon looking to stifle debate on Bill 49 through closure or through some other means—something they’ve done with so many, many pieces of legislation. The ability to bring the perspective from all of our ridings to talk about how legislation will impact our communities, our employers and our residents is the reason we’re all here.", "It diminishes this place when we limit debate on legislation brought forward by the government. It’s bad enough when the calls for ending debate come from cabinet ministers and the government House leader. Even in our beginning debate here this afternoon, up until Mr. Hardeman from Oxford and I spoke, we really only had one speaker to this bill and there were already calls, through a prepared text from the member for Mississauga–Streetsville, that debate needs to collapse.", "We had the ORPP legislation here last week. We had 19 members in Her Majesty’s loyal opposition who were unable to speak to that bill because the government invoked ending the debate. It’s disappointing when the government shortchanges constituents from other ridings that don’t have the opportunity to speak and allow those voices to be heard.", "In the context of today’s debate it’s also critical that we look at exactly what is happening to immigration trends in our province. We look back over the past decade or so, and there’s an obvious trend that is unfolding. In 2001 and 2002, approximately 60% of immigrants to Canada settled right here in the province of Ontario. But from 2003 on, there has been a steady decline. The numbers speak for themselves and they speak very loudly.", "The result is that in 2011, Ontario’s share of newcomers to this great country was just 40%. That’s an incredible decline and it means our province is missing out on everything these newcomers have to offer. So I guess the question is: What happened in 2003 that would have triggered such a decline in the province? Ah, yes. I think I remember: 2003 was the year Dalton McGuinty became Premier and put the wheels in motion on a set of policies and, really, overall management that has ruined our economy and made Ontario a fiscal basket case.", "The decline in immigrants seeking a new start in Ontario and the downward slide in our economy under this Liberal government, I suggest, is no coincidence. We know companies want to invest in well-run provinces, and, in fact, so do new Canadians. Just as we’re seeing more companies choose to look elsewhere, more and more newcomers to Canada are deciding Ontario just simply isn’t worth the risk. Now, I know some of the members don’t want to hear this, but as I said, the facts speak otherwise.", "I’m not trying to take any cheap shots at the government. I think other members can do that. I just think it’s critical in today’s context of Bill 49 that we let those statistics speak for themselves. Our caucus, as I’ve said at the outset, is generally supportive of the bill. There are some good reforms there, but I think in reality it’s simply not enough to think we can bring more immigrants to Ontario by working together as legislators. We need to do more, because the underlying issue is the broken economy.", "Immigrants want to settle where they and their families will have the best chance for success, and right now—I know they don’t want to hear this—they’re not picking Ontario. It’s bad news. I mentioned earlier in this bill that I did want to provide some context for Leeds–Grenville, and I want to highlight something.", "The most recent Local Labour Market Planning Report for the 1000 Islands Region Workforce Development Board talks about how important this issue is to a rural riding like Leeds–Grenville. Before I begin, I want to put a plug in for Frank O’Hearn and his team at the 1000 Islands Region Workforce Development Board. Frank is the executive director of the organization. I had a chance to meet with him during the winter break. I was troubled to learn that there were some rumblings around his organization’s future because of some changes the government is proposing. I’d just like to take this opportunity to remind the government—and in this case, for this organization, the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities in particular—about how important this organization is. The work and invaluable information they provide employers and economic development officials in my riding is critical to charting our course in building our economy. While we do need to look at how to become more efficient and spend our resources wisely across government, the minister needs to understand how much value there is in retaining this expertise at the local level.", "Back to the board’s report and its connection to the debate that we’re having this afternoon: Our region’s employers are being squeezed for labour supply because of the combination of low population growth and an aging workforce. As an example, the report notes that the median age in Leeds–Grenville is 46.7 years, compared to the Ontario figure of 40.4 years. I should also point out that in eastern Ontario, we’re exporting our youth to other provinces, like Alberta and Saskatchewan, where there are simply more opportunities for them to find work. That is also leading to a shortage of skilled labour for employers desperately trying to fill jobs. So it’s a huge challenge we’re facing, and I know Leeds–Grenville isn’t alone.", "Immigration, of course, becomes the key to meeting this challenge. As the workforce development board’s report states, and I’m going to quote it, Speaker, “There is a low organic population growth which points to a need to attract more international and provincial migrants to the area.”", "The picture being painted here is that the mismanagement of our economy is a double whammy to employers in Leeds–Grenville. First, the economic climate makes it harder for them to get the edge on competitors—or plants within their company—in other provinces or around the world. Secondly, they’re finding it harder and harder to find those skilled employees they need to compete, because newcomers to Canada are choosing provinces other than Ontario. Sadly, Bill 49 is not going to fix that.", "To the government, we say: Let’s work together, obviously, and get Bill 49 passed, once we’ve had a chance to have a full debate, not a contracted debate by the government. But let’s also give some recognition that this legislation isn’t, on its own, the reason we’re going to solve the underlying problem of why fewer immigrants are settling in Ontario. I think we’d all agree that that recognition starts with the government tabling a budget with a real plan to create jobs and get Ontario back to fiscal balance. A province where waste, scandal and, frankly, incompetence have come to define its government isn’t one in which newcomers are going to decide to make a new life. Until this government wakes up to that fact, I’m afraid we’ll continue to struggle to hang on to our own best and brightest, let alone attract from other countries around the world.", "Thank you very much, Speaker.

Thank you for allowing me to pick up where my colleague from Leeds–Grenville ended on Bill 49, the Ontario Immigration Act.", "I do have a lot to add to the debate, and I did have the opportunity just over a year ago, I believe it was, when I was the critic for citizenship and immigration at that time, to bring comments on the first evolution of this bill. But I would like to say that I have had the opportunity for two and a half years or so to hold the role of chair of community outreach for our party, the Progressive Conservative Party. During that time, I’ve had the opportunity to meet people throughout various communities in Ontario, but particularly here in the GTA, which is the multicultural capital of Canada and quite possibly North America. We have a beautiful mosaic of people living mostly in harmony here in the GTA and across Ontario, and they bring so much to this province’s rich cultural history. Of course, it started a long time ago, as we’re all immigrants to this country and to this province.", "I have been in this position as chair of outreach for about two years now. We just went through a really interesting time, as the lunar new year is upon us. This is the Year of the Goat, Sheep or Ram; it just depends on which community you are from, but this is supposed to be a rather calm year, according to the moon. The lunar new year says that this is supposed to be a calm year and that there are not going to be that many explosive issues that occur.", "Some may argue that there already have been some explosive issues for our government here in Ontario, perhaps in Sudbury with an investigation that’s under way there, but I digress.", "Last year was the Year of the Horse, and things were supposed to be happening fast. Now we’re on to the Year of the Sheep.", "I have had the opportunity to meet many people in the Vietnamese community, the Korean community and the Chinese community here in the GTA. As a matter of fact, a couple of weeks ago, up in our caucus room, we had the opportunity to bring people in from all of those communities and have our own lunar new year celebration. I think a lot of that was the opportunity for us as party members and caucus members to reach out to members of the various communities. They very much understand the fiscal responsibility that we stand for in our party, and the fact that what’s happening in the province right now doesn’t meet their value system.", "They understand that, in order for us to prosper as a community, we have to look after our finances, and we have to be fiscally responsible as a government—something that this government, the Liberal government, has been very abhorrent in accomplishing. Unemployment in Ontario is up around 7%. It’s completely unacceptable, and I believe it’s now 92 consecutive months that the unemployment rate in Ontario has been higher than the national average—something like that. It’s a long, long time.", "My friend from Leeds–Grenville just mentioned a few minutes ago the fact that fewer and fewer newcomers are choosing Ontario, and the main reason that they’re not coming to Ontario is because there is better opportunity for them to get a job in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. They’re prospering in the western provinces. They’re going through a little bit of a hiccup right now in Alberta, but there is an opportunity here to grow and create jobs in Ontario, and this government is letting down not just the people who live in Ontario, but the people who want to come to Canada and get a job in Ontario. They’re not living up to their responsibilities as a government.", "I think it’s only fitting, with the miners in town right now, that we bring up the fact that Ontario has slipped from being one of the top mineral-producing jurisdictions in the world down to number 23, and this has all happened because this government has been asleep at the switch. They’ve been asleep at the wheel for huge projects and huge opportunity, where Saskatchewan has taken advantage of potash; newcomers are coming to Ontario and then heading out to Saskatchewan because there’s more opportunity there. Or what’s happening out in Alberta in the oil sector: There’s the opportunity for them to get jobs in Alberta, so that’s where they’re going.", "Here in Ontario, we’ve been sitting idle on the Ring of Fire now for 10 years. Nothing seems to be happening, and I know that those who are going to be attending the events with the mining convention that’s under way in town, the PDAC convention that’s in town right now, are going to be talking about that, because we’ve been hearing it in our caucus: the fact that Ontario continues to slip, continues to slide down the ratings systems that are out there, and the Ring of Fire, that great opportunity in northern Ontario and James Bay, isn’t being seized by this government.", "The fact that our province is mired in debt—the province is now approaching $325 billion in debt. These people who are coming here are educated. They do their homework. They know where the opportunity is. They see what’s happening here in Ontario, and they’re choosing to go out west. With $20 billion of debt added this year alone to a $12.5-billion deficit that we’re dealing with in Ontario, we’re not able to look after the infrastructure; we’re not able to look after our health care system in this province, because we’re paying far too much money—$11 billion a year—in interest payments on the debt. That’s money that’s not going into our infrastructure and our health care. The reason that potential newcomers to Canada are choosing the western provinces is quite obvious.", "Let’s talk about some of the other communities that I’ve had the opportunity to spend some time with over the last little while. On Saturday, I had the opportunity to join the National Council of Canadian Tamils, the NCCT. They had their big gala up in Scarborough. It was a very well-attended event. All of the political parties at the federal and provincial level and a lot of our municipal counterparts were there. There’s a population and there’s a community that’s growing in Ontario. The Tamil community has come here and they’ve started businesses. They were telling me on Saturday night that they’re not going to be able to grow their businesses in Ontario because of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan that’s coming. A lot of them are small business operators. Their businesses don’t have a pension plan, so they’re going to be exposed to this ORPP scheme that is going to be taking money out of the pockets not only of the employers, but of the employees, as well. They can’t afford to live here in this province right now. It’s a tax. It simply is a tax, and this is another detractor for people wanting to come to Ontario to live, to set up a business and to have a better opportunity for their families. They were telling me the other night at this dinner that Toronto and the GTA and Ontario were their number one choice when they arrived here but the cost of living in Ontario is getting more and more expensive every day and the opportunity for them to raise their families is becoming more and more difficult with each day that passes. They watch things like the ORPP coming down the pike—and we just rushed through debate on the ORPP here in the Legislature the other day. They’re also hearing about things like a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system that’s coming. Finally, when the price at the pump starts to go down a little bit, the Ontario government, this Liberal government, wants to slap on a carbon tax or some kind of cap-and-trade scheme that’s going to make it more expensive to drive their vehicles, which is going to make it more and more expensive for every product in the province of—" ],

That’s the lowest of any Canadian province. I’ll tell you that one again: Approximately 51% of immigration to Ontario falls into the economic immigration category. So we’re not doing a very good job at attracting those who fill jobs that we need here in Ontario. Fewer and fewer jobs are available in Ontario, but we’re not doing a very good job matching either. It’s the lowest of any Canadian province. The national average for economic immigration across Canada’s provinces is approximately 70%, so we’re about 20 percentage points below that. One explanation for that could very well be the lower employment rate for new Canadians in Ontario, which currently sits at 75.4%, according to the Centre for Immigration and Community Services. The number is well below that of provincial leaders, like Alberta and Manitoba, which have employment rates for new Canadians in excess of 82%.", "That was one of the themes that I heard from people as I was doing my small business round tables across the province.

In a lot of cases, I would speak to somebody who was trained as a physician in their own country. A lot of the hospitals that we’re talking about in their chosen country were equally comparable to the type of hospitals that we have here, with the technology we have here and the advancement that we have here.

We are also aware of the human costs of not adequately supporting immigrants once they arrive in our community.", "The member from London–Fanshawe shared an email she had received from an internationally educated engineer who was frustrated and discouraged about not being able to enter his profession in London. In my comments on this legislation, when I spoke to it in the last Parliament, I also shared stories from constituents in London West, similar stories of internationally trained physicians who were losing hope about ever being able to practise the specialized skills they spent years training for. These constituents are at the point of leaving London, maybe even leaving Ontario. They are telling other professionals from their home countries not to come to Canada, telling them they will not be able to find work in their chosen profession.

The bill makes a strong statement about the value of immigration to Ontario. It includes a commitment to francophone immigration. It specifically recognizes the importance of family and humanitarian commitments, and it recognizes municipalities and employers as important partners. All of this is positive and encouraging, and as the MPP for London West, I can tell you that the fact we are talking about immigration is important to my community. It helps to support London’s efforts to enhance our reputation as a welcoming community and to strengthen our capacity to provide settlement and integration services. These efforts are being led by an amazing collaboration between the city of London and the United Way in the London and Middlesex Local Immigration Partnership, or LIP. Many of you have LIPs in your communities. They are federally funded bodies established to enable local engagement in immigration settlement and integration. They support collaboration and coordination across sectors and community partners, many of which are provincially funded. They also lead a process of strategic planning at the local level. Evaluation of the LIP model is validating the success of this approach, demonstrating the value of engaging all stakeholders in local planning and implementation.

Half of all immigrant households live below the poverty line.", "We know that immigration is critical to our economic and social well-being as a community and as a province, and we therefore have an obligation to make sure that the services are there to welcome and support newcomers when they arrive. We need caring and compassionate services, culturally competent services, especially for refugees, those who are fleeing persecution from their home countries or have experienced war or trauma.", "I’m proud of the work that is being done in London. For example, the Muslim Resource Centre for Social Support and Integration is an organization that has garnered national attention for its culturally responsive and evidence-based programming. Like so many other agencies, however, the MRCSSI struggles for funding to stay afloat, despite the significant need it is meeting in our community.", "I’m now going to turn to a summary of the main provisions of Bill 49 and then focus on some of the issues that are not addressed but must be taken into consideration as the province moves forward.", "First, Bill 49 enshrines into law the province’s authority to establish and govern settlement programs for both temporary and permanent immigrants and also gives the ministry the power to set targets for the number and types of immigrants to Ontario with selection criteria that meet provincial, economic and labour market needs.", "This sounds like a major change. However, it is important to note that the federal government would have to approve any new programs and targets, and there is no guarantee this will happen. While Ontario has been able to attract some immigrants under the provincial nominee program, Ontario’s share has historically been very small.", "Second, the bill enables the minister to conduct research, organize education and training programs and appoint committees on immigration-related issues. This is a vital aspect of the bill because we need to understand what programs are working, how they are working and how we can improve.", "Third, the bill allows the minister to establish registries for both employers and recruiters who are interested in participating in Ontario’s selection programs. This employer registry is similar to that currently in place in Manitoba for those who hire migrant workers from overseas, and the recruiter registry aligns with the new protections that were passed earlier this session. A disappointing omission is that the bill does not require employment agencies and recruiters to register, which is something we would have liked to see, given the stories we’ve all heard about unscrupulous recruiters and the exploitation of foreign workers.", "There is also a lack of clarity about the role of the federal government since employers must apply directly to the federal government to recruit migrant workers, and there is the omission of lawyers and consultants and anyone else who provides employment, guidance, advice, placement or any other kind of recruitment services for newcomers. These professionals are absent or excluded from the registry.", "Fourth, the bill sets out a number of provisions related to process, new measures to monitor and detect possible contraventions of the act, new powers for the minister to collect, use and disclose personal information and a new compliance and enforcement regime, including inspection, investigation powers, offences and penalties for both individuals and organizations. The bill also establishes regulatory authority in areas such as program administration, eligibility, compliance, internal review and the payment of fines.", "Finally, the bill aligns requirements under the Regulated Health Professions Act with those in the Fair Access to Regulated Professions and Compulsory Trades Act to improve the ability of internationally educated health professionals to enter their profession and to require timely decision-making, transparency of records and reasonable application fees.", "As the NDP critic for training, colleges and universities, I now want to focus on some issues related to post-secondary education that are not identified in the bill but must be addressed as the federal government proceeds with its new Express Entry immigration process, which will definitely have an impact on how we do things in Ontario.", "First, there is a concern that federal changes to immigration may make it more difficult for international students who have recently graduated from Canadian universities to qualify for permanent residence. Under the old system, international students with Canadian work experience were given priority status when they applied for permanent residence, and thousands of students have stayed in Canada and Ontario as a result.", "Relatively open access to permanent residence has been a significant advantage for Ontario colleges and universities in their international student recruitment efforts. Many institutions have developed comprehensive infrastructure to support their international recruitment initiatives.", "As of January of this year, however, the new system of Express Entry will place international students who have a degree or a diploma from a Canadian institution in a pool with all other skilled workers. There, they may be invited to apply for permanent residence if there is no Canadian qualified to do the job but will have to compete on points with skilled workers who may have many years of experience.", "Currently, international students make up the majority of Ontario’s 2,500 provincial nominee program spots. Under the new rules, they will still be able to apply for permanent residence through the provincial nominee program and are, therefore, likely to make up an even greater proportion of provincial nominee immigrants, given the competition they are going to face in the Express Entry pool.", "The focus on economic class immigrants and the increased provincial nominee program targets that are included in Bill 49 thus shift responsibility for settlement service provision away from government and gives it over to employers and post-secondary institutions. Since employers and post-secondary institutions have not traditionally been involved in settlement service delivery and may have limited experience in ensuring appropriate services, concerns have been raised about the quality of service provision. When immigrants are not effectively integrated into the local community, they may decide to move their families elsewhere, including to another province, which defeats one of the main purposes of the provincial nominee program.", "This shift in the provision of settlement services also raises policy implications about funding and about the ability of employers and post-secondary institutions to deliver comprehensive settlement supports.", "At the same time that we’re seeing this shift, there are also calls from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce for colleges and universities to expand recruitment initiatives aimed at international students. The chamber is calling on the government to modify eligibility requirements and the provincial funding formula to allow international students and graduates to access all provincial newcomer settlement and labour market integration programs and ensure that adequate funding is provided to meet the increase in services.", "The second issue that’s relevant to my critic portfolio concerns bridging programs for internationally educated professionals. These programs help internationally educated newcomers adjust to the Canadian context and address any gaps in the competencies or skills they require to practise in Ontario. These are often delivered in post-secondary institutions.", "Just last month, the Fairness Commissioner issued her 2015 report and highlighted persistent problems that create barriers to internationally educated professionals entering practice. These include issues around the fairness of registration requirements, the quality of assessments, registration decisions and access to records. Some of these issues are going to be addressed in Bill 49. However, many of the issues she identifies will not.", "Her report called on regulatory bodies to justify the necessity of all requirements for registration, including the requirement for Canadian work experience. This is often the biggest, most insurmountable barrier that an immigrant faces. In 2013, it was also found by the Ontario Human Rights Commission to be discriminatory. The Ontario Human Rights Commission has actually passed a policy that calls on regulators to remove the Canadian experience requirement except for very rare circumstances. The policy states that employers and regulatory bodies must ask about all of a job applicant’s previous work and not where they got their experience.", "The Fairness Commissioner’s January report also includes some other recommendations; in particular, sustainable funding for bridging programs. The report points out that bridging programs are highly dependent on project funding from the Ministry of Citizenship and the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities. Recognizing that fees to participate in these programs are often quite prohibitive, the ability of internationally educated professionals to participate can be limited. The commissioner encouraged the expansion of the Ontario Bridging Participant Assistance Program, or OBPAP, to enable more internationally educated professionals to access bridging. One example: It costs about $12,000 for the internationally educated nursing program. OBPAP provides only $5,000 to help offset the bridging program tuition. So you can see that this would present a real barrier to an internationally educated nurse.", "I also wanted to make a couple of additional comments about the bill, particularly in light of my role as NDP critic for women’s issues. The Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants pointed out that the programs that Ontario funds for settlement and integration are small; however, these programs form a critical component of the service continuum and provide opportunity to meet the needs of unserved and underserved groups. Women are clearly an underserved group in the settlement sector or in the immigrant-serving sector. Bill 49 is silent on the role of the community-based, non-profit immigrant- and refugee-serving sector, which we see as a concern.", "Some of the agencies involved in the sector are doing some great work to apply a gender lens to the immigrant experience. We know that males are more likely than women to be economic-class immigrants, and female spouses are much more likely to be family-sponsored immigrants than male spouses. Sponsored individuals are highly vulnerable because of their uncertain legal status in Canada, which depends on having an ongoing positive relationship with their sponsor. If the relationship breaks down, sponsored women may feel that they are unable to leave their home. If they experience violence or abuse, the risks of reporting the violence are enormous because of fear of deportation.", "There has been research conducted showing that sponsored women who have not obtained permanent residency status are systematically isolated and excluded from society. They are often home with their children, not eligible to participate in the formal labour market, have no access to language training or other settlement programming, and are not eligible for social assistance. So organizations at the community level, like OCASI, play a vital role in sensitizing settlement workers to the unique experiences of immigrant women.", "In closing, Speaker, while we appreciate the intent of Bill 49 on this side of the House, we are also concerned that the legislation does not address some of the real and fundamental challenges facing newcomers to our province, some of the challenges I spoke of earlier. It does not address the long-standing problems of ensuring that highly trained immigrants are able to work in their professional field and that they find employment that matches their experience and can earn incomes that are in line with those of other, similarly educated Ontarians.", "It does not deal with settlement issues, such as housing, education, health care and a myriad of other issues. It does not address issues that affect non-economic-class immigrants—refugees and family-sponsored immigrants—including their ability to enter the labour force.", "These are issues that did not just appear on the government’s policy agenda this year, or last year, when the bill was first introduced. These are issues that we have been hearing about for years and years in this province.", "We are glad that the legislation has finally been brought forward. We are glad that we are talking about immigration in this place, because we recognize the importance of immigration to our shared economic and social prosperity. However, we are disappointed that the Liberal government did not act sooner to bring this forward. After more than a decade in office, it’s time that immigration legislation is being discussed." ],

In those days, the best jobs were not in the country. When my uncles were looking for work, they went to places in northern Ontario, because at that time we were mainly rural, with jobs in northern Ontario in the mines, because that became the place to go. Another uncle went to the States because of the car industry in Detroit during the depression.", "But then there was a period of time when Ontario got booming. We were the place to be in Canada. Our manufacturing was second to none in this country, and actually second to none on this continent. Now we’ve seen that dry up. Jobs aren’t here. Immigration, we see from the stats, is moving to places other than Ontario, because that’s where they can get a job and that’s where opportunity lies.", "Of course, we’re doing something to try to attract our fair share. Our numbers have been dropping. New Canadians are well-trained, smart people. They don’t want to come to Ontario and not have a job, or be underemployed like we’re seeing. They want a good-paying job, and unfortunately, under this government, they have to go elsewhere.", "We want to see that come back.

We’re in that border area where, in Dearborn, Michigan, I believe it’s the highest Lebanese population outside of Beirut. People come where the jobs are. They bring their families, they open businesses, their young people get educated and their relatives go back and forth across the border. I think Windsor right now has some of the best Arabic restaurants in the entire province.

We can all benefit from new immigrants coming into our province.", "The thing that troubles me more than anything, though, is that we have to do more to recognize the skills, educational backgrounds and professions that many of our new immigrants bring.

I have research here. The Ryerson internationally educated social work professionals bridging program reports that 90% of the graduates of that program are professionally employed within six months of graduation. So bridging programs work. They are a very effective way to help internationally educated newcomers bridge any gaps that they may have and to get to practise the career they were trained for.", "But they are very difficult for many newcomers to access. There’s a lack of stability around the programs because institutions never know if they’re going to be able to offer them. Students can’t really afford to access them when there are very high tuition fees involved, and many of these internationally educated people are working survival jobs during the day. They can’t afford not to work in order to go to a bridging program.", "I think there is lots of opportunity for the government to introduce new measures on bridging programs, to introduce more financial supports for both students and institutions to participate." ],

In my riding of Scarborough–Agincourt we have an organization called CPAC. They have done an outstanding job in terms of a bridging program supporting internationally trained accountants and financial advisers from overseas.

Recently, CPAC also had a partnership with the University of Toronto in terms of language training and support.", "With regard to the bridging program that the member from London West talked about, to date our government has funded the bridging program, targeting more than 100 occupations and close to 50,000 highly skilled immigrants. Since 2003 we have invested more than $240 million in terms of the bridging program.

Immigrants have added to the cultural fabric of this province and nation. It is important that we help them continue to succeed in Ontario. That is why we have brought forth the Ontario Immigration Act.", "I understand the challenges that newcomers to Ontario experience, because my husband and his family emigrated from El Salvador. My husband, his two brothers and his parents settled in Ontario in the late 1980s. They are extremely proud to call this province their home. But there were challenges in adapting to their new life here; for example, as simple as filing our income tax, navigating our very complex health care, job searching, registering the children to our school system.", "That is why I am proud to stand today in support of the Ontario Immigration Act. Like my family, I want all who choose to come to Ontario to have the supports they need to succeed in this province. This bill, if passed, would give the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration the authority to establish and govern settlement and integration programs. This is a continuation of our strong commitment to newcomers to Ontario. In the 2013 Ontario budget, this government affirmed that “the Ontario immigration strategy responds to the province’s demographic and economic realities. The province will be proactive in attracting the best and brightest in the world to Ontario, and helping immigrants and their families to settle and prosper.”", "For newcomers, adapting not only to a new life in a new country but also communicating in a new language is not easy. My husband came to Ontario, Canada, and learned not only English but French. I feel very proud today to say that he’s fluent in English, in French and in Spanish. It did not come easy, and it did not come easy for his parents to learn a new language. That is why I’m proud to say that, since 2003, we have invested approximately $460 million into language training. Not only are we helping immigrants to better communicate; we are helping them obtain the training needed to succeed in Ontario.", "Je suis fière de notre investissement de plus de 240 millions de dollars dans plus de 300 programmes de formation relais, un programme qui a aidé plus de 50 000 nouveaux arrivants qualifiés à l’étranger à intégrer rapidement le marché du travail de l’Ontario. I am proud to stand and talk about this record.", "There are many members of this House who are either grandchildren or children of immigrants, or even immigrants themselves, as we heard today. It is amazing to see that many in the House understand the realities inherent in being an immigrant.", "I hope everyone here will support the bill. J’espère que tous et chacun vont appuyer ce projet de loi in order that we may continue to support those who want to call Ontario their home.", "From a personal standpoint, Mr. Speaker, when I look at the struggle that my husband and his family encountered here, it gives me great pleasure to sit in this Legislature today and talk about the reality of our immigrants and all the right programs and the good programs that are supporting them. Certainly, we have a lot more to do, but this is a first step, as we heard. There is always better to do, and our government’s commitment is there.", "I look at our immigration law, and increasing our 5% francophone community right here—and we know that a lot of them come to Toronto. We want to add those services. We want to help them reach their full potential by giving them access to the right training so they can find the right job.", "Encore une fois, c’est un immense plaisir pour moi d’adresser la Chambre sur ce sujet très personnel envers ma famille, qui a vécu—et je vis chaque jour dans ce sentiment qu’on a été privilégié, avec mon époux, de pouvoir apprendre les langues et de pouvoir s’adapter, mais il y a eu beaucoup de défis. Donc, I thank this government for their effort, and I ask everyone again in this House to support Bill 49." ],

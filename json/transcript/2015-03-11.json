  "text" : [ "It is an honour to rise in this House and to have the opportunity to speak to Bill 40. Of course, we know that Bill 40 is the Agriculture Insurance Act. It’s an act to amend the Crop Insurance Act of 1996.", "This particular bill sounds impressive at first; however, Ontario farmers actually grow and raise more than 200 different commodities, so less than half are currently covered by production insurance. And so for far too long, Ontario farmers have been at a disadvantage compared to their counterparts around the country. Ontario is the only province left in Canada that does not have legislative authority to offer plans for a broad range of agricultural products. Ontario is once again left having to play catch-up.", "If passed, Bill 40 would extend this coverage to farmers who produce products other than crops and perennial plants. They will finally have access to the insurance they need to protect their livelihoods, the same basic protections that other farmers across the country have had for years. This will of course increase the stability within our agricultural sector, and it is a move that I wholeheartedly support.", "There are just about 2,200 farms in Chatham-Kent, which account for, surprisingly, 3.8% of Ontario’s total farms. This is down from the 2001 census, but it’s still a lot of farms.", "Leamington is known as the greenhouse capital of North America, with an astonishing 1,500 acres under cover or, as I like to say, under glass. In addition to these farms, greenhouses in Chatham-Kent also now account for 3.2% of Ontario’s total greenhouse area. One of note—and I worked with this particular company to help them get established in their location in Chatham—was Cedarline Greenhouses, which recently partnered with GreenField Ethanol, which was actually a very unique opportunity. With the partnering of GreenField Ethanol, they now are able to use surplus heat and carbon dioxide to save about 40% on heating costs. It was an amazing opportunity, an amazing business approach to reducing their costs and yet creating jobs and employment right in Chatham-Kent.", "As an industry, agriculture provides about 16,000 jobs and is a $3-billion sector in just Chatham-Kent alone. Chatham–Kent–Essex is home to some of the most fertile land in Ontario and Canada. Cash crops include wheat, soy beans, corn—and apparently wind turbines. They’re sprouting up all over prime farmland, Mr. Speaker.", "My riding is also the number one producer of tomatoes, seed corn and pumpkins in all of Canada, and in addition produces nearly 20% of all vegetables grown in Ontario. We’re the number one producer of sugar beets, green peas, broccoli, lavender, cauliflower and quail in all of Ontario. I’m very proud of my riding of Chatham–Kent–Essex.", "Another group that comes part and parcel with agriculture is the food producers of Ontario. Food processors know the importance of local food. Nearly 40% of food manufacturers are in fact located in rural Ontario. They realize the value in using local food in their products. Of the total food produced on Ontario farms, roughly 65% of it is used by the province’s food producers. Food processing is a $33-billion industry that employs 110,000 Ontarians in related industries.", "In my riding of Chatham–Kent–Essex, the food production industry has been hit hard over the last few years, most notably with the closure of the Heinz plant in Leamington. They used to employ 740 full time, roughly 200 part time, and they had roughly between 45 and 50 growers. Well, that number has been slashed, cut, reduced, almost cannibalized, and now roughly 250 people work full-time at the company that actually took over Heinz, which is Highbury Canco.", "Last July, the Canadian Association of Professional Apiculturists released a report that indicated a mortality rate of 58% of Ontario’s bee population. The typical winter bee loss rate is around 15%, according to the report. This is a big reason why the neonics issue has become such a hot topic over the past year. Imagine a cattle farmer heading outside to tend the cows only to find that nearly 50% of them had died. Bees are in fact essentially livestock for beekeepers, and the past year has been devastating to the industry. In December, the member for Haldimand–Norfolk asked the Premier why her government had not implemented an insurance model to help the province’s beekeepers. Manitoba currently offers such a program. Well, the government’s response was less than encouraging. The Premier declined to confirm if Ontario will be getting a similar program and then referred the matter to the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change.", "Of course we understand that we need to address the root causes, if you will, but beekeepers need a relief strategy that is more immediate than stopping climate change. The government needs to have a long-term plan to try to resolve the bee mortality issue, but in the short term, Ontario beekeepers are going to need some help. We want to hear the input of the entire agricultural industry on this particular issue. It is incredibly important that we listen to them, as they’re the real experts.", "We have some concerns when it comes to ease of use and the response time of government when it comes to compensating for unexpected emergencies. Some 300,000 customers were left—", "Interjections." ],

Again, this ties into the government’s response to emergencies. After the storm, it was estimated that the cost would be somewhere around $190 million to cover the damage from the ice storm. It took numerous cities and municipalities over a year to get the application completed, as the application itself was not immediately available.", "A recent article in the Hamilton Spectator showed just how disastrous the whole process was. “Hamilton needed most of a year, special training for 15 staffers and thousands of pages of supporting documents just to ask for $4.1 million in provincial ice storm relief.” Hamilton councillor Chad Collins was quoted in the article as saying, “I think everyone was kind of shocked at the hoops we had to go through.... If you think about it, we routinely apply for hundreds of millions of dollars for infrastructure projects and the process is far less rigorous.”", "When we talk about this particular bill—another thing is that our government in Ontario has paid nearly $3 million to a company called LandLink Consulting to train municipal staff to fill out applications. With that in mind, we’re concerned about what the production insurance application and claim process will actually look like. If farmers are forced to wait over a year for relief from natural disasters or other impacts to their crops or commodities, they might not be in business by the time the insurance payment is actually issued. On this side, we call it red tape.", "In conclusion, I just want to reiterate my support for Bill 40, the Agriculture Insurance Act. It finally delivers on an issue that Ontario farmers have been championing for over a decade. As previously mentioned, Ontario is the only province left in the entire country that does not have the legislative authority to in fact offer plans for a broad range of agricultural products. While I am concerned that it took the government this long to act on the bill, it’s better late than never.", "But what I don’t want to see is the loss or reduction of current programs that help farmers with the implementation of new measures. “‘Agricultural products’ means a product that is designated by regulation.” This means that the minister could make changes to the policy at a later date. The true test of the legislation will come long after it’s passed.", "One of the things that I’m concerned about is the process of payment, but something else as well is the fact that you have a situation with dairy farmers and ground current, which is in fact affecting milk production. It’s killing the cattle itself. The fact is that they cannot put any dollars on lost milk production right now, and dairy farmers are going under. That is not right, and I stand in support of those dairy farmers. I believe that this particular act needs to support those dairy farmers. We need to get the ground current problem under control before it’s way too late, because it not only affects cattle, it affects humans." ],

As a Legislature, we should ensure that the laws we pass speak to what we think is important. What’s really important is that we protect the people who are fundamental to our society. Farmers are absolutely fundamental to our society, and we should implement laws that protect them.", "One of the realities is that the climate change we are seeing and the unpredictability of weather are putting farmers in a more and more difficult position. There is less ability to predict what is going to happen, and for farmers it’s crucial that they have some anticipation, some ability to know: “Okay, the weather patterns are going to be a certain way, so we can anticipate what our crop is going to be like this year,” or if it’s livestock, they’re able to predict the conditions so they can prepare for them. The growing uncertainty with weather is impacting farmers in a very difficult way.

When producers suffer losses and don’t have production insurance coverage, they may come to us for direct or ad hoc assistance. We’ve seen ad hoc programs cost the province millions of dollars in a single year. Further, production insurance is also premium-based.

We’ve appropriated it in the budget.” In this particular case, I’m not aware that the government actually appropriated any of the dollars we need within the budget to deal with the additional dollars that will be needed, essentially in the risk management program that they’ve now expanded.", "So the problem that we’ve got is: You’ve got a risk management program with a budget this big, you have a number of various types of farming activities that are covered under the current program, we’re going to expand those things to other types of farming activities, but we have the same amount of money. As a result, it means to say that we could end up in a situation where we actually have less money to compensate farmers under the risk management program because the government hasn’t appropriated the dollars. Neither the parliamentary assistant nor the minister nor anybody on the government side has ever responded to: Has the government appropriated the dollars necessary to make sure the uptake to this program when it goes into effect?" ],

I recognize the hugely positive impact of agriculture and agribusiness in the Ontario economy. We see, in terms of primary agriculture on the farm, $13.7 billion in terms of an agricultural contribution to Ontario’s annual GDP. We see 158,000 jobs generated by the farm sector across the province; $8.1 billion in wages and salaries supported by Ontario’s farm families; $12 billion spent on farm inputs, with 58% of those jobs actually being in rural areas; and $1.4 billion in provincial tax revenue.", "This is a very, very important segment of Ontario’s economy, and I think we need to repeat those numbers, to continue to remind everybody in this place of how important the agriculture sector is in terms of the overall economy of the province of Ontario.", "More than 70% of Ontario farm products remain within the province. Some $21.3 billion is the annual contribution of the food-and-beverage processor part of the industry to Ontario’s GDP in 2012. We need to know, I think, and be reminded that food processing directly employs more than 91,000 workers across Ontario—and more than 193,000 secondary jobs in other areas of the economy. It’s vastly important to the overall economy of the province of the Ontario.", "I also want to again reiterate my support for supply management.

I have never once wavered, in 25 years in the Legislature, in my support of supply management, and I will support it as long as I breathe.", "From time to time, the Liberal Party has tried to make suggestions and cast aspersions on the support of supply management on the Conservative side of the House. I wish they would stop doing that, because they’re playing a silly political game that is beneath them.", "I think that we need to continue to find ways to reduce red tape in the province of Ontario, in terms of agriculture, and I talked about that during the election. I think we need to continue to find ways to enhance business risk management programs. I know that we’ve got some good programs in that respect, but we need to strengthen them and improve them. From time to time, we hear from farmers that the programs are not working for them, and we’ve got to work on that.", "These are things that should be added, in my opinion, to agriculture legislation in the province of Ontario.", "I strongly support research into agriculture and will continue to do so, because that’s the future of agriculture for our province and for our young farmers coming forward. I think we need to continue to review ways to ensure that we have fair assessment of farm values, and that’s an issue that has been a concern in my riding. Also, we need to take steps to preserve good-quality farmland, because that is the future of agriculture.", "I also believe that if we preserve the future of agriculture, and we give young people a sense of hope that the agriculture industry is going to be a great opportunity going forward in the next decade—in the next millennium, Mr. Speaker—that will encourage young people. If we preserve the family farm, they will, in turn, preserve our best-quality farmland.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, with respect to Bill 40, we say that Ontario is currently the only province without the legislative authority to offer plans for a broad range of agriculture products, and Bill 40 is intended to address that issue.", "In Ontario, we know that production insurance is delivered by Agricorp, a crown agent, and of course, Agricorp is based in Guelph, which is a community very close to my riding. In fact, my riding surrounds it on all sides, and I have a significant number of constituents who actually work there. They’re good people, and they do a great job on behalf of our farmers in the province of Ontario.", "Our farmers have long requested production insurance plans that move beyond just crops to include insurance for additional agricultural products. Bill 40, I gather, is an effort to address that concern, and we’re pleased that it has been brought forward. Currently, we know that Ontario has available production insurance for almost 90 commercially grown crops, including grains and oilseeds, corn, soy, wheat, tree fruits, grapes, vegetables, specialty crops and forage.", "Mr. Speaker, again, I conclude—I only had 10 minutes to talk. Unfortunately, I spent about the first five minutes of my speech talking about the way the government is managing this bill in the House and my concerns about that. But I would again express support on second reading for the principle of this bill, and my hope that the bill, in due course, after the members have had an opportunity to debate the bill and discuss the issues—especially with respect to their ridings—that in fact this bill will move forward in the legislative process." ],

I always enjoy listening to his comments because he’s thoughtful, talks about his riding and talks about what’s important to the issue at hand.", "What’s most important to the issue at hand here is—we hear from the other side that this bill is being delayed. But actually, this bill should have been proposed in 2003. This government has been delaying it. A majority government for most of that time, a Liberal government, has been sitting on its hands while the other provinces moved ahead. They’ve been sitting on their hands for a decade, and now they’re worried if it takes another half-hour or an hour. Really, it’s the decade that’s the problem.", "What is a big issue with this bill—and we’ve brought it up several times, and it’s the crucial part of this bill: There is no money attached. To increase the coverage to more products: great idea. But the way it works, the farmer pays 40%; the province, 26%; and the feds, 34%. Unless it’s identified where that 26% is going to come from, and since we don’t see any new money coming down the pipe, if more products are covered, that means that the government is going to take money out of some other pot. And if it’s the agricultural-risk-management pot, then that’s a direct loss to farmers. That’s not beyond the pale, because when the risk management program was developed—it’s a very good program, but it needed about $200 million to work financially, to balance, and what this government did is, they capped it at $100 million. Farmers know very well that this government can and will actually take money from one pot and put it in another pot, and make it look like it’s a net gain when actually it’s a net loss. That’s why it’s so important we discuss this bill and home in on where the money is coming from." ],

It’s going to do something that needs to have been done for a considerable length of time.

So we have a great lack over the last 10 years or even 12 years of addressing a problem that is 12 years old. That was mad cow disease, when government chose—because of one cow—to close the American border—to tell the world about the one cow, which resulted in the closing of the American border, which was 50% of the exports of beef cattle from Canada.", "Overnight, cows went from being worth 60 cents a pound to as little as two cents a pound, which covered less than the trucking and the auctioning costs of the cow. It literally became more economical for the farmer to take the cow out behind the barn and shoot it and bury it in the manure pile than ship it to market. That was good food that had no value because of a government decision to so-called protect people from a problem that didn’t exist, because never has anybody in Canada ever gotten sick from or died from eating Canadian beef that had mad cow disease. So it was a problem that didn’t exist that cost billions of dollars. This legislation will help fix that." ],

I remember the member for St. Catharines grabbing the floor for more than a day at a time on more than one occasion. And you know what? That was perfectly within his rights, because the rules of the day allowed members to speak and there was no limit to how long they could speak.", "In the opposition at that day, which was a Liberal opposition under Lyn McLeod—or it might have been Bob Nixon; I can’t remember what particular time it was—the member used the floor in order to hold the government to account and put points on the record in regard to what was important to him and to others in this province, not only his own caucus, when it came to the issue at hand. You know what? That’s democracy. I didn’t like it as a government member. I know that the member from Wellington–Halton Hills would have been here at the same time, and he would remember the same thing, where the member did that.", "I also remember at times some of your caucus doing the same. I remember—I don’t remember the riding—Mr. Stockwell doing the same thing. I forget what budget bill it was. I remember the leader of the third party, Mr. Harris, reading into the record the names of every lake and river in the province of Ontario.

In fact, the government has used that mechanism on a number of occasions, especially in the minority Parliament prior to the election, and now has chosen strategically to move to this other way of terminating debate, shutting down the opposition through motions to close off debate.", "I think back to 1957, when the majority Liberal government of Louis St. Laurent in Ottawa was bringing in the pipeline bill. When they brought in a closure motion to shut off the debate from the CCF members as well as the Conservative members in opposition at that time, it caused such a sensation across the country that parliamentary democracy was being usurped by an overly arrogant Liberal government, in this case, shutting down debate, shutting down the voice of the people, in many cases, through the parliamentary process, that it actually led to an election and then in turn to the defeat of the Liberal government. Of course, not too many people study history anymore in Canada, but it’s something to think about. If government goes too far and it shuts down the will of the people through opposition debate, it can sow the seeds, certainly, of significant political change when an election comes.

I want to refer back to her comments because I think they’re quite substantive and speak to the history and the prospects for this bill.", "She was very pleased to have the opportunity to talk to this because this bill contains many bills that she, in the past, has put forward. The bill addresses three areas.", "The first addresses the question of healthy menu choices. In effect, this will require those who are selling prepared food—food to go, fast food, nice restaurants—to inform people through menu labels as to what they’re getting. This is an issue that Madame Gélinas had been bringing forward since 2009. As much as it would have been a good thing to have passed her bill in its previous iterations, it’s probably a good idea that it’s incorporated into this one.", "The second schedule in this bill deals with amendments to the Smoke-Free Ontario Act to ban flavoured tobacco. Again, this is an issue that she’s been working on since 2008. It’s 2015. There are a number of years there where this bill could have been enforced, Madame Gélinas’s earlier private member’s bill, and it would have had a positive impact on reducing the risk of cancer for people in Ontario. The government should have let that bill go forward years ago; unfortunately, it didn’t. It’s incorporating it into this bill. I guess once again one can say, “Better late than never,” but frankly, Speaker, it should have been much earlier.", "The third schedule talks about what are known as e-cigarettes, vaporizers or vapers—whichever one you want to call them—but basically brings regulation to e-cigarettes. Those are the three main sections of this bill.", "Let’s start looking at it in greater detail through menu labelling. The statistics to encourage menu labelling are rather stark. We face a different world than we did 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, when more people cooked at home. People would go to grocery stores; they would buy food; they would be able to read nutrition labelling on the food that they purchased. People were able to make choices based on their interest and the nutritional information that was provided with the food.", "When you look at food labelling in grocery stores, you’ll see labelling that tries to appeal to people’s health consciousness. A lot of brands will talk about having zero cholesterol, zero calories. I don’t know whether you actually get zero calories; maybe with club soda. Who knows? But the simple packaging of food, the attractive label on the cover, is also matched with information on the package about exactly how many calories you’re taking in when you consume that food and what other nutritional factors are to be considered.", "Mr. Speaker, I sense from subtle indications on your part that I may be running short on time.

We would do this by encouraging something that we call the community planning permit system. This system would allow a community to plan their neighbourhood in a way that addresses their real, local needs.

According to the minister’s mandate letter, he has to review the Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy, the building code, the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program, the Municipal Act, and the ones that are relevant to this debate: the Ontario Municipal Board, or the OMB; the growth plan; the greenbelt plans; and a coordinated review of provincial land use plans. While I’m pleased that the government has indicated they’re going to consult on these issues, it’s a little concerning that the minister has introduced a bill that impacts the Planning Act and the OMB before these consultations have actually taken place.", "According to his mandate letter, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and the Attorney General are to work together with key stakeholders and “recommend possible reforms that would improve the OMB’s role within the broader land use planning system.” Mr. Speaker, from what I’ve heard, that review is still coming. But if it hasn’t even started yet, how can the minister introduce changes to the OMB? How can we be sure that any changes made today are going to be reflective of the results of the review? Wouldn’t it make more sense to conduct a full review and come up with a comprehensive plan and then introduce legislation to implement it?", "This is not the only review that we’ve seen conducted before this legislation was introduced. Less than two weeks ago, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing launched a review of the greenbelt, the Niagara Escarpment, the Oak Ridges moraine and the growth plan. This is going to be a comprehensive review of the land use in these regions. In the government’s discussion document for the review, it says, “The four plans work with many other acts, plans, policies and strategies to achieve provincial priorities and goals. This coordinated review is an opportunity to consider how well the plans support and align with broader provincial initiatives, legislation and long-term goals for the region. It is also an opportunity to consider whether other initiatives can be more effectively leveraged to achieve the goals of the plans.”", "Given how much these plans are required to work together and that the government is about to start on months of consultation, it seems ironic that in less than a week after the land use consultation was announced, the government introduced legislation which would change both the land use planning process and the development charges, which we all know impact community growth.", "This bill is entitled the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act. To me, the concept of smart growth should not only include policies that protect our land, but a comprehensive plan for how our communities will function: a plan for transit, a plan for how to accommodate growth, a plan for economic development. If the government is in the process of developing these plans for the Niagara Escarpment, Oak Ridges moraine, green belt and Golden Horseshoe, shouldn’t that plan come before legislation making changes to the Planning Act? How can you determine the legislative changes needed to get you to your destination if you don’t know where you’re going?", "Development charges require a balance between encouraging economic activity and ensuring that municipalities have the funds needed to provide services for the added growth. I know that some organizations have already expressed concerns about the potential increases in development charges under this bill, and I look forward to working with them and municipal organizations to determine what the impact will be.", "There are some specific sections in this bill that cause me concern, Minister, such as the addition of municipal planning committees that include at least one member of the public. While they sound great in principle, for municipalities like mine that currently make planning decisions in open council, it will result in duplication and, in some cases, less transparency. Those decisions are currently being made in an open meeting in front of members of the public and the media. This proposed change could result in those discussions and planning decisions taking place in the back room, where very few people will get to witness what happens.", "I look forward to the opportunity to raise more of these specific concerns in second reading debate.

Some stats show that when you end up at the OMB, the municipalities lose 65% to 70% of the time—in their own communities. If there’s a developer involved, they lose even more than that. Victories are significantly higher when it’s a developer.", "No other province has a tribunal that has the power that the OMB has in Ontario. Part of the problem is that local residents and community groups don’t have the money to fight developers, or to fight municipalities, for that matter, around land use issues.", "A prime example is Waterloo. In 2013, they had a 10-year plan that was overturned by the OMB, which allowed residential development sprawl that was 10 times larger than what the municipality was asking for. The OMB tore it up, allowed it to happen, defied the official plan of the municipality and defied the province’s own Places to Grow Act. Something needs to change here.", "I want to talk a bit about the issue of inclusionary zoning and the fact that we still have a lot of homelessness in this province. In fact, my colleague from Parkdale–High Park, Cheri DiNovo, reintroduced her bill for the fifth time last year. It would have allowed municipalities to pass inclusionary zoning bylaws that would have set minimum requirements for affordable units within new developments as a low-cost way to ensure that Ontarians have much-needed access to low-cost housing—five times over the last, I think, eight years.", "The Liberal member for Ottawa Centre is quoted as saying that both municipal board reforms and inclusionary zoning remain on the government’s to-do list. When? Unfortunately, there are no time frames; there are no specifics. Like the OMB issue, I fear that this will just turn into another empty Liberal promise.", "It’s about time, Speaker, that the Liberals take some action on these issues. They’re important elements that begin to address some of the issues in this particular bill. However, there are critical issues that are actually left out. When I met during the briefing earlier this week, we had no time frame from the government on when they’re going to move forward with the actual review of the OMB.", "What we’re asking here is that the government keep their promises, that they deliver on their promises and that they move on the OMB issue and the inclusionary zoning issue today." ],

As an innovation hub and manufacturing hub for the province of Ontario and the rest of Canada, Waterloo region plays an integral role in attracting skilled workers from around the world to develop our technologically inclined sector.", "About a year and a half ago, the National Household Survey reported that 23% of people in Kitchener-Waterloo and Cambridge were foreign-born.

At that time, the Waterloo Region Immigrant Employment Network established a local immigration partnership. During 2009 and 2010, a large number of stakeholders in Waterloo region worked to develop the strategy and establish three key pillars: (1) settle, (2) work, and (3) belong.", "The Settle Steering Group is responsible for working in collaboration with community partners to carry out strategic activities to improve the coordination of and access to services that facilitate immigrant settlement. Their activities include mapping of services, identifying barriers and access to services, coordinated planning, and training opportunities for enhanced service provision.", "The Work Steering Group is responsible for working in collaboration with community partners to carry out strategic activities with respect to job creation. Members represent businesses and community sectors, including financial services, education, manufacturing, small business, health care, municipal government, employment service providers and members of the immigrant community. The Work Steering Group also supports the government-funded immigrant internship and mentorship programs for internationally trained professionals.", "The goal of both programs is to support a newcomer’s efforts to become professionally established in our community through paid work placements in their field, gaining valuable Canadian work experience; or through an opportunity to be mentored by local workers, where they can learn about working in the Canadian culture. The mentorship program, provided by the YMCAs of Cambridge and Kitchener-Waterloo, matches foreign-trained professionals with experienced professionals from Canada based on shared education, similar work experience and common career goals. The immigrant internship program delivered by Conestoga College, located in my riding of Kitchener–Conestoga, matches immigrants with a post-secondary degree or journeyperson status from another country with employers through paid internships. The length of the internship can vary. Participating in the internship program is a great way for employers to connect with international talent in our region.", "Some of those employers participating would be COM DEV of Cambridge, Conestoga College, Deloitte, the Greater KW Chamber of Commerce, Scotiabank, Teledyne Dalsa technologies—the list goes on and on.", "Finally, the Belong Steering Group will focus on coordination and collective action in order to make Waterloo region a more inclusive community. It includes public awareness and inclusion, as well as immigrant leadership and civic participation across the following areas: education, community supports and information, justice, arts and culture etc.", "Recognizing all the work done by Immigration Waterloo Region, it’s time that the province get up to speed with supporting our immigrants in my riding and across the entire province. Bill 49, an act with respect to immigration to Ontario, aims at working with the federal government’s extensive changes to the immigration system in Canada over the last decade, including the federal skilled worker program and the provincial nominee program, to name a few.", "This past January, the federal government introduced the expression-of-interest immigration reforms to make the system more responsive to labour market demands, to ensure that immigrants can find well-paying jobs and become strong citizens of Canadian communities across the country. As such, the federal government is encouraging provinces to develop systems that will allow for them to participate in the EOI system that is now implemented.", "EOI really works in two steps. First, prospective immigrants would indicate their interest in coming to Canada by providing information electronically about their skills, work experience and other attributes. Individuals who meet certain eligibility criteria will have their expressions of interest placed in a pool and ranked against others already in that pool. Citizenship and Immigration Canada would only invite the best candidates, including those with in-demand skills or with job offers, to apply for a visa. Expressions of interest that are not chosen after a period of time may be removed from the pool. As a result, application backlogs would not accumulate and processing times would be kept to a minimum.", "Of course, CIC also assesses applicants on a variety of other factors, such as education, work experience and language ability, with a greater emphasis on the ever-changing needs of the Canadian labour market. The Canadian government is working with provincial and territorial partners to make EOI a success, as we see outlined here in this bill. In partnership with Ontario’s employers, the hope is to be ready to find candidates in the EOI pool that meet their skills requirements when the domestic labour force cannot.", "As we look at fixing our immigration policy in Ontario, I want to take a moment to look at other provinces and territories in Canada. Of course, the most obvious and cited example is Quebec’s immigration policy. As a result of the 1991 Canada-Quebec Accord, Quebec fully assumed responsibility for establishing immigration levels and for the selection and integration of immigrants in areas under its responsibility. Quebec develops its own policies and programs, legislates, regulates and sets its own standards. In contrast, Ontario’s immigration policy is tied to that of the federal government.", "Recently the federal government released immigration stats for the last year. What they also provided was a table of statistics from 2004 through to the end of 2013 on the amount of permanent residents in each province and territory. There are three categories that make up the definition of a permanent resident. They are based on foreign nationals sponsored by close relatives or family members in Canada and include spouses or partners, dependent children, parents and grandparents. Permanent residents are also based on economic immigrants, who are people selected for their skills and ability to contribute to Canada’s economy, including skilled workers, business immigrants, provincial and territorial nominees, and live-in caregivers. In addition, permanent residents are based on refugees, which include government-assisted refugees, privately sponsored refugees, refugees landed in Canada and dependents of refugees landed in Canada who were living abroad.", "Here in Ontario, the number of permanent residents is quite startling. Newfoundland and Labrador saw their permanent resident number nearly double from 2004 to 2013. PEI’s permanent resident number has, in fact, tripled. Nova Scotia has increased by more than 1,000; New Brunswick, the same. Quebec’s numbers increased the same as well during the same time frame. Manitoba’s number almost doubled, and Saskatchewan’s number increased from roughly 1,000 to 10,000 during the same time frame.", "What is interesting is that you can clearly see that the numbers are increasing around Canada, but here in Ontario that is not the case. In the time from 2004 to 2013, Ontario has lost 25,000 permanent residents. If we look at how many of those permanent residents are economic immigrants, which this bill focuses on, the numbers get worse. In Ontario, in 2004, the number was 67,000. In 2013, that number dropped by 20,000 to just 47,000.", "Let’s compare those numbers to the western provinces. We continue hearing stories about Ontario-trained skilled workers packing up and heading west. Manitoba, in 2003, had 5,000 economic immigrants. That number almost doubled in 2013 to 9,600. Saskatchewan had 883 economic immigrants in 2004, and due to their job creation strategy and investment in their mining sectors, they increased their permanent residents 11 times to over, 9,000. Alberta, for instance, had 8,700 in 2004, and in 2013 they had 22,000.", "It is clear that the number of jobs available is reflective of the number of permanent residents in the provinces and territories across Canada. This is why Ontario isn’t meeting the mark.", "We’ll have more opportunity to get into that. I did prepare 20 minutes; I know I’m now on 10 minutes, so I’ll conclude in the few seconds that I have left. I look forward to questions and comments, and I’ll finish up in the last two minutes that I have. Thank you, Speaker, for the time." ],

One of things that we talk about as well is international students. We are encouraging international students to come to Ontario to attend our post-secondary education institutions. We want them to come here. But when an international student comes to Ontario, the tuition costs are astronomically high. You’re talking maybe $10,000 to $12,000 a year. One of the concerns the CFS brought to the table was that international students are covered under UHIP, so they have to pay for that as well. That’s another $2,000 to $3,000 a year.", "One of their asks was, if we’re encouraging international students to come to Ontario to attend our PSE, why not give them the same opportunity to be covered under OHIP?", "Have that window where they arrive in Canada and have that three-month waiting period—they would have their own insurance that they have to pay—but then, after the three months, they could access our health care system. We’re encouraging them to study in Canada, specifically in Ontario, but we’re not providing the support services they might need for health care.", "The international students have spoken about the expense, and access to UHIP is also limited to a certain number of doctors, which makes it difficult, of course, when they need medical attention.", "On that note, I think we could be looking at topics beyond the bill that’s here today, so that we can encourage international students but also have the supports they require when they get here." ],

Under this government, we’ve seen the percentage of minimum wage jobs skyrocket, but we don’t think that’s right. We think that our goal shouldn’t really be a basic job; it should be a job where people can grow, raise a family and buy a house. That’s why we’re seeing new Canadians not stopping here anymore. They’re going directly to the other provinces.", "It’s embarrassing when you look at the drop in population in that segment. I wouldn’t have thought that was so, but when you look at what’s happening, it’s a sign of the last 12 years that this government has gone off course, I think, and they’ve forgotten what’s required for economic growth. No longer are we looking for minimum wage jobs—they think the solution is to raise the minimum wage. But our goal is really about people getting great jobs. I look forward to speaking more on that today." ],

Just like I talked about a few minutes ago on inclusionary zoning and the Ontario Municipal Board, they’ve been around for 11 years but they haven’t passed any legislation to actually assist newcomers.", "I had an opportunity to reach out to the Welland Heritage Council about this legislation, and the advice from their immigration expert was that as we proceed with this legislation, it would be good to reflect on what changes Ontario can make to address the wage and opportunity gaps between immigrants and native-born Canadians, because stats show that skilled immigrants are underemployed or unemployed due to barriers that they probably didn’t even know about before they landed in this country, in this province, and some of those barriers are more prevalent in the province of Ontario. So while doctors and engineers arrive in Canada and don’t necessarily expect to be absorbed immediately into the system, it would help if there was a clearer picture when people are immigrating into Canada and Ontario, to be clear about what adjustments they are actually going to have to make when they arrive in this province.", "Thanks for the opportunity, and thanks to the member from Kitchener–Conestoga for his comments." ],

She reported on the provincial nominee program, and I will share, really, her findings with those listening, which are actually quite interesting. The auditor stated that “the ministry needs to have robust, fair and transparent processes to allow it to consistently make the best nomination decisions. It also needs to track and measure how well people nominated in the past have in fact contributed to Ontario’s economic development.”", "In her report, she explains, “Immigration selection programs are inherently at high risk of immigration fraud.” A weak immigration program, one not keeping par with today’s technologies, can be targeted, she says, which is true in Ontario. This means there is a significant risk that the provincial nominee program “might not always be nominating qualified individuals who can be of economic benefit to Ontario.”", "In conclusion on Bill 49, the government must implement a better database system, clearer rules and guidelines for ministry employees, enforcement mechanisms and security tracking. At the end of the day, those who immigrate to Canada do so for a better life for themselves and their families. They want a good job that pays them enough to support their family, and employers want skilled labour to help their business. It is the government’s responsibility to be the facilitator and enforce these rules.", "Speaker, I give the government the task to follow through on their commitment of Bill 49 by cleaning up our immigration and working more closely with the federal and municipal governments. But in addition to that, I ask the government to put forward a job creation plan in partnership with Bill 49 to address the serious issue facing over 600,000 men and women who don’t have a job here in Ontario today." ],

From that strategy, we eventually come to the contents of this bill.", "Mr. Speaker, it has been a long road, and today we will talk about some of the things that made it into this bill and some of the things that didn’t; what we feel are steps in the right direction and what we can do to build on those first steps.", "I would like to start by looking at one of the recommendations made by the government’s Expert Roundtable on Immigration: “Employers and communities need to be champions in the integration of immigrants.” This is a fairly broad statement, but its implications are significant. This bill acknowledges the importance of immigration to Ontario’s economic future, but it does not properly address many of the fundamental challenges that newcomers face. Whether it is settlement issues such as ensuring that appropriate and affordable housing is available or professional barriers such as the issues newcomers encounter with receiving accreditation in their field, we need to consider the whole process when we are making change. We need to have supports. The lack of necessary bridge programs leads to instability. Whether someone is an expectant mother, diagnosed with a disease, or a victim of abuse, newcomers in their first three months in the province lack the safety nets that otherwise exist for other Ontarians. In Quebec, there are policies in place to protect newcomers if they unfortunately end up in challenging circumstances. In Ontario, however, the lack of policy has a devastating impact on the lives of countless newcomers.", "Another concern is that this bill also doesn’t do anything to close the existing loopholes when it comes to temporary and migrant workers. This means that this bill will do nothing to address the fact that migrant workers are immensely more vulnerable to exploitation, and will do nothing to address the crisis of precarious employment that exists, in general, in our province. This is not a small portion of the population.", "In 2012, Ontario had over 70,000 migrant workers compared to fewer than 50,000 economic-class immigrants who were granted permanent residency status that year.", "Typically speaking, the fastest growth of migrant workers has been in low-wage industries, through the Temporary Foreign Worker Program.

Why are we good enough to work here but not good enough to stay?”", "As we follow this case, we should remain aware of its implications and work to improve the working conditions and living conditions for migrant workers here in Ontario. Hopefully our actions in Ontario will give the government of Canada the inspiration it needs to address these problems on the federal level.", "In 2006, a federal government review of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program acknowledged the failure of the program to safeguard migrant workers from exploitation. A 2009 review by the federal Auditor General also noted abuses and inadequate oversight, yet these problems continue today.", "Since migrant worker exploitation isn’t a focus in this bill, I would like to focus on it here. In a response to these issues, the Ontario Federation of Labour released a report in August 2013 entitled Labour Without Borders: Towards a Migrant Workers’ Bill of Rights. We know it was also distributed to government. The report analyzes the conditions that migrant workers experience in Canada, and ultimately proposes a bill of rights for migrant workers, to protect them from abuses and exploitation.", "I want to take this opportunity to read into the record the proposed bill of rights for migrant workers from this OFL report.", "“All migrant workers should have the following inalienable rights:", "“(1) Permanent residency and citizenship rights: ... The capacity for migrant workers to contribute to communities in Ontario should be recognized and they should have access to permanent residency.", "“(2) Right to information: All migrant workers should have access to information about human rights, labour rights, workplace health and safety and employment standards....", "“(3) Union protection and labour rights: ... Many migrant workers face the threat of being blacklisted or not being invited back to Canada if they try to organize. As per the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the International Labour Organization convention number 98, all migrant workers should have the right to organize in a union and bargain collectively.", "“(4) Full benefits and health care rights: ... Migrant workers should have full access to social programs and benefits including Employment Insurance, workers’ compensation, social services and settlement services, both by law and in practice. Migrant workers should also have access to health care. Employers are required to provide health insurance until migrant workers qualify for provincial health care; however, there is widespread non-compliance on the part of employers in fulfilling this responsibility.", "“(5) Freedom from recruitment fees: ... During recruitment, migrant workers are often charged exorbitant fees. This is entirely unacceptable and employers should bear the cost of recruitment, which is a standard cost associated with running a business.", "“(6) Housing rights: ... Employers frequently provide or help migrant workers to find housing during their employment. Housing and living conditions are too often inadequate. Every migrant worker should live in safe, sanitary and comfortable living conditions.", "“(7) Mobility rights: ... Currently, migrant workers’ work permits are tied to a specific employer. Work permits tied to sectors or provinces would provide workers with more freedom of mobility once they arrive in Canada.", "“(8) Freedom from discrimination: All migrant workers should be free from all forms of discrimination including racism and sexism. This should include equal remuneration for all workers regardless of race, nationality or gender.”", "You can see that there are things that could have been added to this bill and considered by this bill that haven’t been.", "Speaker, these are not radical or revolutionary ideas. These are the rights that are naturally extended to us as Canadian citizens but denied to migrant workers during the time that they spend in our country every year.

Certainly Bill 49, I hope, will be a step in the right direction to encourage more immigration to Ontario—the types of immigrants that we so desperately need to build our economy—but you can’t look at this issue in a vacuum. The reality is that part of the reason we have fewer immigrants interested in coming to Ontario and setting up shop—working here—is, quite frankly, because our economy is in decline.", "If we’re not going to have government policies and government ideas that bring forward and grow our economy, then how can we possibly expect people who are looking and have the opportunity, quite frankly, to go to any province in Canada, let alone other countries—why would they look to Ontario?

Bill 49 is a good first step, but we cannot look at these issues in a vacuum, because the reality is that if we’re not building a strong economy, then there is no interest for people to move here, to set up here and to find jobs here." ],

I have to say that as I debate this bill, I think back to stories my grandfather used to tell me about how he immigrated to Canada and what it was like back then. He talked about how, when he immigrated, which was just after World War II, there were a number of immigration interviews that he had to go through. In those days, Canada was concerned about attracting the kinds of workers who could fill the labour market of the day. In those days, one of the types of jobs that needed to be filled was for the type of folks who were strong, who were handy, who could build some of the power lines, the hydro lines, that we benefit from today. That’s what my grandfather did when he came to Canada; he did a lot of manual labour. He was a fit for the labour market of the day.", "Nowadays, of course, the labour market has evolved, it has changed, the economy has evolved, and we need to make sure that our immigration policies are keeping up with that. We need to do that for a few reasons. First of all, it’s important to our economy. It’s critical that we do what we can to make sure that everybody who lives in Ontario has a chance at a job, has a chance at supporting their family, reaching their potential and contributing to the economy, which benefits us all. But it’s also important to the people and the quality of life of the people involved. When I think about my grandfather, he was able to come to Canada, immigrate, settle, find a job and was able to support his family. I’m one of the beneficiaries of that. We need to make sure we’re doing that.", "There are many people in our country who come and, unfortunately, struggle to find a job. I can think of many people in my community of Etobicoke Centre who are in that position.", "What I think is excellent about this piece of legislation is that it strengthens Ontario’s ability to make sure that it’s attracting the kinds of people who can settle in Canada, settle in Ontario successfully, achieve those jobs and achieve that potential that every Ontarian hopes for and deserves." ],

Anyway, that’s a case to watch.", "If I may, just in closing, I’d like to finish by reading an excerpt from the letter written by Julia Deans, the chair of the government’s Expert Roundtable on Immigration: “Attracting and settling immigrants is not just the job of government; this is about nation building and we each have a role to play. From better defining our labour market needs to preparing newcomers, our recommendations emphasize the need for the provincial and federal governments to work together and with other sectors.”", "We know that there is a lot of work to be done.

It’s very, very unfortunate that that type of situation is in fact occurring—it is continuing to occur. That’s a sad thing, because we want to be able to have opportunities for people.", "My colleague from Dufferin–Caledon talked earlier about the fact that the more serious instances here—in order to welcome immigrants into Ontario, is the fact that we need to have good jobs. We need to have a stronger economy. The debt has, in fact, doubled since this government came into place. It once went from $125 billion—which is when they came in, but it’s now upwards of $286 billion and getting higher. Well, unfortunately, that is forcing businesses out, and when the businesses go, the jobs go. When the jobs go, there’s nothing for talented, skilled-set immigrants." ],

They have UHIP, and they have been lobbying this government for years now to have—if we’re going to allow them to come into this country, if they’re going to pay exorbitant, very high tuition rates, then they should actually have access to health care.", "There’s a young woman who sat in my office this week, and she’s got two young children. And it was not clear to her, when she came into Ontario, that when she became a student in one of our post-secondary institutions, that when she went to the emergency room with a child with a huge fever, UHIP would not cover that. In fact, she had to pay $870, which you’ll know—as a student, they just don’t have the money.", "This piece of legislation, obviously, is long overdue. That’s already been said about it. But a lot of the conditions placed within it, of course, are contingent on federal co-operation or collaboration. The issue of the federal government allowing refugees, for instance, into this province, into this country, and not offering them health care services—I mean, they choose refugees and immigrants to come into this country based on their need of health care, and then they get to this country—it’s a point of shame for us, as Canadians, to actually deny health care. It’s a universal right, and it’s something that every piece of legislation that comes through this House should be embedded in." ],

Unfortunately, the federal government hasn’t been a great partner with us in Ontario over the past years, so that we couldn’t attract as many talented people to Ontario from other countries in the past years. Hopefully, in the future, particularly by passing this bill, we will make a good collaboration and the federal government will make a good collaboration and the federal government will make a good collaboration with Ontarians in terms of the selection of new immigrants to Ontario.

Last year, in Ontario, we had 9,000 people graduate from teachers’ college to fill 5,000 jobs. That is truly a mismatch and failure of our education system, I would say, because it makes for 4,000 very unhappy people who don’t have a job. But they do have the debt of getting that education and have wasted—well, temporarily have wasted four years of their time. They might better have been educated in a field that matched a job at the end of their school time.", "A different story that is a happy story for workers is at Cambrian College in Sudbury: 24 people graduated this year from their electrical technician/pole-climbing program, for 300 jobs.

This bill contains provisions that do not respect our common-law rights; specifically, private property rights and the right to due process. This will inevitably lead to abuses of power.", "About warrantless entry, Bill 49 gives inspectors, after having completed a course of training approved by the director, the authority to enter premises without a warrant. Warrantless entry, combined with other provisions in the bill that establish absolute liability, sizable penalties and the absence of proper appeals process, is an infringement upon our constitutional right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure, as articulated in section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is alarming how many bureaucrats have been provided with warrantless entry authority by this provincial government. If the inspector has reasonable grounds to suspect that someone is violating the law, what is the difficulty in obtaining a warrant?", "As well, what type of training is contemplated for inspectors and investigators? For instance, will the training include the teaching of Canadians’ common-law rights, as defined in our Constitution?", "About the appeals process, section 8 of the bill allows the minister to cancel a registration in the employer or recruiter registry and inform the holder of the registration of the cancellation by letter. The only appeal set out in the bill is a request for an internal review, which has very few procedural protections for the requester in the bill.", "When it comes to the appeals processes, we need to be very careful to protect people’s rights and ensure that the provincial government is not given the opportunity to act arbitrarily and behind closed doors. We need a proper appeals process with effective oversight and accountability.", "The process outlined in the bill for an internal review does not require the minister to share with the requester the specific charges or evidence that the minister relied on in the original determination. In fact, the minister is not obliged to reveal what, if any, evidence it possesses or uses during the cancellation process or the internal review process.", "The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations regulating these matters, but is not required to do so. To adequately defend themselves, employers and recruiters should be provided with the specific charges and evidence being used by the minister in their determination and be given adequate time to reply.", "Subsection 28(8) of the bill establishes a standard of absolute liability with respect to administrative penalties. Absolute liability means that the minister may fine a person or corporation up to $150,000 per contravention, even if the person took all reasonable steps to prevent a contravention or had an honest and reasonable belief in a mistaken set of facts that, if true, would render the contravention innocent.", "Again, a proper appeals process that protects the right of the accused is completely lacking in the bill. People need to be provided with an opportunity to avail themselves of a proper defence during a proper hearing with proper procedures to protect their rights if they are being fined. Where are the rights of due process?", "The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations governing the rights of the requester under a request, but is not required to do so. I would prefer to see due process rights in the legislation, as regulations can be more easily changed and do not come to this chamber for full and open debate.", "About bureaucratic convenience, when the provincial government writes legislation for the convenience of bureaucrats, we are at risk of losing our common-law rights. I hope it is not the intent or case here, but I have my doubts, as we have seen this played out over and over again over the last 11 years in Ontario. It is not surprising to anyone who has studied history that bureaucracies with little or no legislative constraints placed on them have the potential to abuse their power. It is human nature; not that public servants are bad people, but that bad people are attracted to and desire power over others and will naturally be attracted to positions with minimal constraints on their behaviour.", "That is why we need to be mindful and include legislative provisions in bills to protect the rights of Canadians and not continue to give bureaucrats increasing power over every aspect of our lives.", "About immigrants, one of the best parts of my job is talking to people who have come to Canada from places all around the world and listening to their personal stories. It is awe-inspiring to hear people’s stories of their escape from tyrannical countries run by corrupt officials in order to gain the liberty and freedom that Canada has to offer.", "Unfortunately, what I hear from Canadian immigrants more and more these days is that Ontario is beginning to resemble the corrupt and tyrannical country that they were able to escape. Vast and ever-expanding bureaucracies are not compatible with liberty and freedom. Even worse are privatized bureaucracies that do not answer to the people through their elected representatives.", "My point is that, as my colleagues have pointed out in previous speeches, Ontario has declining immigration due to high taxes, large deficits and debt, increasing red tape, diminishing economic opportunities, and high and soaring energy costs, but also because we in Ontario are losing our common-law rights in an unprecedented and continuing attack by this provincial government.", "These issues are connected. Our common-law rights are the basis for Ontario’s prosperity, albeit currently declining prosperity. Losing our rights will inevitably mean losing our prosperity.", "Immigrants from despotic Third World and Communist countries know this. They understand that freedom forms the foundation of prosperity, which is why so many are willing to leave behind everything they know to come to Canada for freedom and prosperity, to build a better life for their families and themselves. They don’t understand why we in Ontario would so casually fritter away what most of the world’s population can only dream of.", "In conclusion, if we don’t reverse this trend, in the long run there may not be a need for an Ontario immigration policy, and that would be sad. Ontario has so much to offer. It would be a shame if immigrants decided to reject Ontario and settle in more friendly provinces because the Ontario provincial government demolished the very rights and freedoms that attract immigrants to Canada to begin with." ],

Many hospitals aren’t enrolled in it; many physicians aren’t enrolled in it.", "They gave me an example of one international student who became pregnant while she was here, going to university in Toronto.

That itself became a problem for students. Now we have the university actually putting in a health care plan, but I don’t even know where those premiums are going.

So 100,000 come this year, and we have to ensure that they’re properly integrated in society with jobs, with housing, with education, with health care. Then, on January 1, another 100,000 come. It never stops. So it’s critically important to have tools in place in Ontario so we can best accommodate these immigrants, because it is extremely challenging for cities, communities, workplaces and schools to make sure that newcomers fit in.

But my fear is that this government is going to stand up in the next minute or two and shut down debate like they have with the agriculture bill and the Ontario pension plan etc. We’re quite concerned about that.", "Congratulations to the member for bringing this forward. The gist of his point is the fact that Ontario is losing too many jobs. Ontario is not a place of opportunity anymore. It makes it tougher for immigrants not only to come to this province but to stay in this province. Unfortunately, too many people are heading west who should be staying in this province. It’s not just immigrants who leave; it’s people who have been in Ontario for years. I can tell you that a number of my nieces and nephews have headed west due to the fact that there’s no opportunity for these young folks here.", "What the government needs to focus on—and I wish they would focus on it—is putting together an economic plan that would actually cut the waste, cut the overspending and create an economic environment that is positive for investment in this province. Unfortunately, they’re headed in the wrong direction. You can see it with their deficit, which is climbing, at $12.5 billion. They are obviously not even on target to balance this budget, and until they actually take seriously the effects of what they are doing to this province, it’s going to be tougher for immigrants and Ontarians and Canadians to stay in this province." ],

Those 12 years could have been better spent addressing some of the issues related to immigration and to the situation faced by newcomers to Ontario. So it has taken a while to get moving on this, but like I said, it’s better late than never.", "Since Europeans first came to this land, immigration has been a key element of our growth as a nation. It’s as true now as it was 200 years ago. Today, as was pointed out by the Expert Roundtable on Immigration, it is estimated that Ontario will face a shortage of 364,000 skilled workers by 2025. As our population ages over the coming years and people leave the workforce, we cannot come close to replacing those people without a significant influx of people of working age from other countries. In fact, the round table also stated that immigration would need to be increased by 250% to offset that decline.", "In my hometown of Hamilton, we have a group called the Hamilton Immigration Partnership Council that has said, “Without immigration, Hamilton will witness a declining and aging population, a smaller workforce and diminishing tax base.” But over the past number of years, Ontario has experienced a drop of almost a third in its share of immigrants coming to Canada. In 2001, over 59% of immigrants to Canada came to Ontario; but in 2011 that figure dropped to 40%.", "As I mentioned, we’re facing an ever-increasing shortage of skilled workers. To fill those jobs, we need those people we call economic immigrants: people selected for their skills and their ability to contribute to our economy. But again, the percentage of people in this category has been falling in Ontario. In 2001, 64% of Ontario immigrants were economic immigrants; in 2011, that had fallen to 52%.", "If we look at the actual numbers, it’s even more startling. In 2001, 89,079 economic immigrants came to Ontario; but in 2011, only 36,939 in the same category settled here. That’s a decrease of about 60% in 10 years. In Hamilton, between 2003 and 2008, only 41% of immigrants were in the economic class, significantly lower than the equivalent figures for Ontario and Canada for the same period. This comes at a time when Hamilton is seeing a rapidly changing economy that requires a different skill set from our previous needs.", "This Ontario Immigration Act is specifically designed to increase the percentage of economic immigrants. For example, following the round table on immigration’s target of increasing the number of immigrants through the provincial nominee program to 5,000, this bill attempts to set those targets. The problem is that the federal government still has the power over immigration matters, and there is no guarantee that Ontario will be able to set those targets. The attempt is in the bill, but there is no guarantee.", "I had a constituent contact my office a couple of months back. This was an employer who wanted to bring three people into Canada who had a particular skill—a skill that was not widely held in Canada—through the provincial nominee program. Each of these positions would have resulted in three other jobs for local people. She was having a problem getting her application processed and was looking for some assistance.", "When we looked into it, we found out the reason that the application could not be processed was because the target for 2014, which was 2,500, had been reached a couple of months previously, and the federal government had not yet told the province what the target would be for 2015. Although the provincial nominee program was still accepting applications, there was nothing that could be done with them until the federal government set a new target and started accepting applications from the province.", "We were told that it would take months before she could get the workers she needed. These were workers she knew—she knew their names and she knew their skills. She knew the immediate demands on her business, and she knew these were the people who would enable her to respond to that demand, people who would enable her to take her company up a level and provide work for nine other people in the Hamilton area.", "The Expert Roundtable on Immigration said, “Making the immigration system work better for Ontario requires a renewed partnership between the provincial and federal governments.” As we’ve heard, Speaker, how true that is.", "The province of Quebec, for years, has had a significant influence on immigration and immigration policy, but Ontario has been left behind.", "I had a look at some of the annual reports of the Hamilton Immigration Partnership Council and noted the following paragraph in the message from the chair—a similar paragraph is included each and every year. I’ll read it now: “I must acknowledge the work of our many partners—the government of Canada, the city of Hamilton and the many individuals, organizations and institutions that participated in our work.” Some of the members may have noticed that what is normally a key partner in public policy work is missing, and that is the government of Ontario. I’m pretty sure that that omission is not due to an oversight, a mistake or an intentional slight against the government. No, it’s simply a reflection of what has been happening over the years in communities across this province.", "The provincial government has not been a partner with other levels of government when it comes to immigration, and it’s time for that to change.", "The importance of bringing new immigrants to our communities is only one part of the equation. We also have an equally—and probably more—important role to play when it comes to matters of immigrant settlement.", "We need to make sure that those people we attract are able to contribute fully and allow them to meet their full potential. Sadly, that’s not always the case. If we look at average incomes, immigrants, and especially recent immigrants, earn significantly less than Canadian-born workers. Figures from a few years ago published by the Hamilton Immigration Partnership Council give us an average income of about $55,000 for those born in Canada. For the immigrant population, it drops to around $40,000, and for recent immigrants it’s only about $22,000. These numbers are quite consistent with averages for Ontario as a whole.", "The council also points out that these differences in income between Canadian-born workers and immigrants increase with the skill level and education.", "The number of highly qualified immigrants who are not working in fields they are trained in is disgraceful. I know many people who are scraping together a living in precarious work, such as driving taxis, yet they have excellent professional qualifications. We are doing them, and ourselves, a disservice by not giving them the opportunity to put their skills, education and experience to its best use.", "Unfortunately, this bill does not address these issues, nor does it address some of the fundamental challenges new immigrants face when they arrive here. Affordable housing is one example—a problem, for sure, for many Ontarians, but particularly so for immigrants.", "So, yes, Speaker, I support this bill.

They left something that was very rough in Europe, in my ancestors’ case, and were able to come over here and turn Canada into what it is today.", "Over the years, we’ve welcomed immigrants, new Canadians coming through, and it has been a very positive experience for the vast majority of people. We’ve turned around and have been able to be a positive experience back to the world itself. We look forward to an act that actually continues to encourage our growth.", "As we proceed through this debate, it is very important to keep in mind that any power our province gets regarding immigration is lent to us by the federal government. Unlike with Quebec, all other provincial nominee programs can be stopped at any time by the federal government.", "The provinces can select a minimum number of candidates for immigration and issue them a nomination certificate that allows applicants to submit an application to Citizenship and Immigration Canada. There, all applicants, including all provincial nominees, are screened against criminal- and health-related inadmissibility before being granted permanent residence.", "Canada is held in high regard around the world. We are seen as prosperous, tolerant, welcoming and fair. Prior to Minister Jason Kenney’s tenure as the federal Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Minister for Multiculturalism, the immigration backlog resulted in many prospective immigrants waiting close to a decade to see their application processed. The long-term commitment these workers made to see their Canadian dream come true is a mark of how attractive Canada is for people who want to work, live freely and enjoy the fruits of their labour.", "Today the immigration system is nimbler, faster, fairer and more responsive to the needs of employers and skilled workers. Under express entry, prospective immigrants can create an online profile outlining their skills and eligibility for Canadian immigration and register with the Canada Job Bank. Employers can then find the best potential employees and select them, regardless of the order in which the applications are received. Immigrants are also ranked in the general pool of applicants according to their skills, education and experience, with the top-scoring candidates receiving an invitation to apply.", "Only two trump cards exist in today’s system: a labour market impact assessment and a provincial nomination. These give candidates sufficient points to rank at the top tier of applicants and all but guarantee an invitation to apply.", "Before I remark on the provincial nomination, allow me to outline what kind of bureaucratic competition the provincial nomination program is up against. The impact assessment is granted by Employment and Social Development Canada to employers who want to bring an immigrant to fill a position that no suitable Canadian residents have applied for. It costs $1,000. Employers can recover this fee from the employee, and the assessment is processed in 10 business days. Once a positive LMIA is granted, the prospective immigrant enters it into their express entry profile and waits for the next round of invitations. The federal side of the express entry program takes 10 business days and the $1,000 is paid by the employer.", "The provincial nominee program for Ontario is divided into two steps. In the first, the employer applies for a pre-screening similar to the LMIA, providing proof of attempted recruitment of Canadians and Canadian permanent residents. Once approval is granted, an individual then pays either $1,500 or $2,000 to receive the official provincial nomination. The whole process can take 90 days for each step, or about six months in total. Simply put, the current provincial program costs about twice as much as the federal one and takes about 10 times as long. Quebec’s program, by contrast, costs $765, and the Alberta one is free.", "The cost of the program isn’t the only factor where Ontario is less competitive than the other provinces. The number of spots available to Ontario provincial nominees is stuck at 2,500 per year because many new immigrants leave Ontario to find work, or better work, in the western provinces.", "Good immigration policy hinges on attraction and retention. Toronto and Ontario have the potential to attract the best and the brightest; however, we are not utilizing it. We have a multilingual and highly skilled workforce that makes us capable of doing business with every other country and industry in the world. Our immigration system is much simpler, quicker and fairer than that of our neighbours to the south. We have an excellent reputation for tolerance, inclusion and ease of integration. Canada is the highest-ranking G8 member in the Global Peace Index, a testimony to peace, order and good government.", "However, our cost of living is rising. The government may not want to acknowledge the problem; however, successful businesses are being put on the brink of bankruptcy by increasing power rates, and residential power is increasingly unaffordable.", "The government is mulling a carbon tax, which would make all goods, including food, more expensive. The proposed Ontario Retirement Pension Plan will decrease the take-home pay of Canadians and permanent residents alike.", "Immigrants come to Ontario to improve their lot and realize their dreams. With a string of economically damaging policies, this government is slowly sucking the energy and the drive out of the Ontario dream.", "Why should a prospective immigrant choose Ontario when they know the Wynne government is strapped for cash and seeking new revenue tools? Many immigrants leave behind realities where graft and lawlessness take away the reward for a hard day’s work and their certainty of a better tomorrow. It is up to us as legislators to ensure that Ontario can clearly and enthusiastically offer them the confidence that they can build a better, freer, richer life in Ontario than anywhere else in Canada. We can achieve this by saying clearly, “We stand by your success and we are proud of it, and we commit to doing everything in our power to make sure your hard work can achieve more.”", "But the Liberals aren’t doing this. Bill 49 will create employer and prospective employee registries, and create an enforcement framework. However, a registry is of no use if there aren’t jobs to fill it. If the government continues on this course of higher taxes and reckless spending, Bill 49 will not make the difference for future Ontarians. Faced with the prospect of high provincial program costs, long delays and an uncompetitive business environment, skilled workers will look elsewhere for the opportunity to make their dream a reality.", "We look at the cost of this program—and we’re going to require a bureaucracy. We can just hope that we can deviate from our past practice and encourage the government to make sure that any bureaucracy is effective and efficient, and provides good oversight. But we will not get our fair share of economic immigrants because we just don’t have the jobs.", "We see companies now that are leaving—not going out of business but moving.

A good job is a good-paying job; it’s a job with a future, a job where you’re allowed to work and progress through the company and actually one day aspire to lead the company. Unfortunately, that’s a problem here. We’re seeing too many minimum wage jobs. This government seems to be concerned more about providing more around minimum wage than we are looking at trying to develop jobs that people actually aspire to and can actually pay good taxes and help bring the economy along. As everybody knows, when you’re in a minimum wage job, the taxes you’re paying are very minimal at best, and likely you don’t have the benefits that many of us have and enjoy.", "I think the focus of this government should be around, yes, creating a good framework. But it won’t work if we don’t have the jobs available for the employers to actually take advantage of it by registering and pulling in people so it actually can work. We hope that that will change.

It makes sure that we make clear that our newcomers are important and that we have a vision that allows for them and their skills to be recognized.", "Right now, there is a situation where the federal government is making decisions about who comes and what kinds of skills they bring to the table. Ontario has very, very specific needs. We need to be able to be on the ground, see where those needs are and react as quickly as possible in order to make sure that we are getting the workers where we need them. It doesn’t do Ontario any good, for example, to have oil workers or other kinds of professions come in where we don’t have the need when it comes to jobs. We need skilled workers. We don’t want to waste those skilled workers’ trades and abilities. We need to put them to work. I can’t tell you in any stronger terms how important this is.", "The measures laid out in this bill will be critical for laying the groundwork for this province to operate a more comprehensive and effective immigration program now and in the years ahead.

We, as a government, stand by that.", "The member mentioned taking things seriously, and we do take the matter seriously. The Premier, the House leader and every member on this side who has answered the question has given the same answers over and over again. So I’m going to repeat it. Elections Ontario has determined that the allegations against the Premier and the member for Sudbury are baseless. The Chief Electoral Officer has clearly stated: “I am neither deciding to prosecute a matter nor determining anyone’s guilt or innocence. Those decisions are respectively for prosecutors and judges.” Mr. Speaker, it’s in the hands of authorities to deal with it, and I would say that it rests there." ],

  "text" : [ "Thanks very much, Speaker. I can’t say that it’s a pleasure to be here because I have to express to you, and through you to the parliamentary assistant, my frustration in getting even the most simple of questions answered. I really tried today to provide a very simple question to the Premier. I hope that her parliamentary assistant, who I ask very sincerely this question—today I simply asked, on what date the Premier, her office or her lawyers, was contacted by the Ontario Provincial Police to schedule a meeting regarding this ongoing investigation. I think it’s a very simple question, given the fact that in the media—back in February, there were media reports that the Premier and her deputy chief of staff were going to have a meeting with the Ontario Provincial Police. I’m not going to go back to the fact that that week I asked her repeatedly, on a number of occasions—I think four to six times—if she had a meeting scheduled, and she didn’t answer the question.", "So I was as surprised as anyone to read in the media back in February—this is now five weeks ago—that they were going to have a meeting. I’m even more shocked that the Premier could not meet with the Ontario Provincial Police regarding that ongoing investigation.", "It has been stated in this House that the Premier did find a very open schedule when it came to meeting with the Chief Electoral Officer. She opened up her schedule and met with Mr. Essensa, and she’s quite open when she talks about that. As we all know, the Chief Electoral Officer doesn’t have powers to prosecute but must, as part of the process, refer the matter to the Attorney General’s office. I want it again placed on the record that the Premier found lots of time in very short order to meet with the Chief Electoral Officer—but now it has been five weeks and still no direct answer.", "Tonight I hope that before the parliamentary assistant runs off to the heritage dinner he’ll have a very simple answer for my question: Can you give me the date the Premier, her office or her lawyers, was contacted for a meeting? Was it five weeks ago? Was it longer than that? Was it five hours ago? We’ve tried to give the Premier lots of opportunities to clear the record.", "I wrote to Vince Hawkes, the commissioner of the OPP, in mid-December when I first saw the Facebook postings from Andrew Olivier in Sudbury. I wrote, as did the third party House leader, Mr. Bisson, the Chief Electoral Officer back in mid-December to ask them to investigate. We all know that the Chief Electoral Officer’s report has already been tabled in this Legislature, has already been referred to the Attorney General. The wheels are in motion, yet there is this reluctance to answer the basic questions about when you were contacted.", "I, quite frankly, have criticized the Premier in the past for standing up in a press conference and saying things that I felt were interfering in the investigation. To me, not meeting with the OPP is, I think, borderline interfering in this investigation again. She has to be able to take this matter seriously, meet with the Ontario Provincial Police, have her deputy chief of staff do the same and have some sort of participation in a very serious matter. This is a government that is involved in not just one or two but four OPP investigations. These are active investigations, with very serious allegations.", "I would think that a Premier who came to this place and who put in her throne speech the fact that she would be different from her predecessor, the fact that she would open with honesty, openness and transparency, to be able to sit here, day after day after day, and not answer questions about participating in an open OPP investigation—it’s shameful, Speaker. I’m ashamed that the Premier takes this matter without seriousness. She needs to open up her schedule and have that meeting.", "I’m asking, through you, that the parliamentary assistant answer that question: What was the date that she was contacted by the Ontario Provincial Police for a meeting? I want to know that. Ontarians want to know that." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. My primary concern is that the question, again, was quite simple. The Attorney General cancelled an engagement—made an engagement to speak in Sudbury and then, after having committed to that speaking engagement, decided to cancel it. My question was: What did the Attorney General know about the Sudbury scandal and when did she know about it?", "The essential question is: When did she find out that there was anything amiss in the Sudbury bribery scandal? Because her knowledge is important. It’s important for us to hold the government to account. It’s important for us to know who knew what and when. The scandal is something that strikes at the heart of—one of the most important principles of our democratic system is having faith in the administration of justice and having faith in the administration of our province. The fact that a minister would know, could know or might have known something about this incident could be beneficial to the members of this Legislature, but, in addition, to the citizens of the Ontario.", "The scandal really strikes at the heart of one of the growing problems in our province: the fact that there is increasing apathy. Year after year we’re seeing less and less people coming out to vote. There’s a reason for that. People find they don’t trust politicians; they don’t trust the political system. They feel that their vote doesn’t matter. When politicians engage in cynical behaviour, when politicians behave in potentially illegal behaviour, it further fuels that apathy. It’s incumbent upon the opposition to hold the government to account and to say, “Listen, that type of behaviour is simply unacceptable.”", "It’s simply unacceptable for a government to believe that they’re above the law. The Chief Electoral Officer made a historic finding. It’s important to highlight this: It has never been found in the history of Ontario. First of all, an investigation of this type, into the allegations of bribery on the part of the government, has never happened in the history of Ontario. The Chief Electoral Officer wrote that in his report.", "In addition, there has never been an apparent contravention of that act that has ever been found by a Chief Electoral Officer. These are historic things that are not good historic things. These are very troubling and very concerning. An apparent contravention—let’s make sure it’s very clear—is not a finding of guilt or innocence. The Premier has mentioned that a number of times, and we want to make sure it’s clear that we’re well aware that it’s not a finding of guilt or innocence. But what it is a finding of is an obvious contravention, obvious and glaring. Based on the evidence, it’s an obvious and glaring violation of the Election Act—that there’s very clear evidence that points to a prima facie case for a violation.", "Now, of course, a judge will be the final arbiter of guilt or innocence, but the fact that on the face of the evidence, the Chief Electoral Officer was able to say that there is enough evidence here for me to say that this is more than just a fair probability that the Election Act was contravened or violated—that there is more than a fair probability, based on the evidence, that there was a violation on this.", "We talked yesterday about the sentence or the potential punishment. This is a serious contravention. If found guilty, there is both a $25,000 fine as well as two years less a day imprisonment in terms of the punishment that is potential. So these are very serious allegations that carry a very serious punishment.", "That’s why I asked the question today. The Attorney General did admit that she was going to attend the event in Sudbury. She admitted that she was going to attend and that she cancelled it because she wanted to maintain the appearance of fairness and not actually attend. But that’s important to know. Why, then, did she cancel that appearance? What did she think or what did she know at the time, and when did she know that, that gave her the impression that, “Listen, me attending could cause a problem”? That’s exactly the question.", "The Attorney General mentioned a part of the answer, that she did indeed cancel going and that she did indeed think that there would be a perception problem, an optics problem, if she did attend. Well, then, what did she know and when did she know it? What were the facts or the circumstance around her decision to say, “Listen, I don’t want to go there because it might be seen as a problem. As the Attorney General, there’s a certain level that I have to hold myself to,” which is appropriate.", "But what did she know, and when did she know it, that made her decide that she couldn’t go to Sudbury—that it was inappropriate for her to go there? What did she know about the bribery scandal? Was she informed and when was she aware of that? Those are the questions that I did not receive answers to." ],

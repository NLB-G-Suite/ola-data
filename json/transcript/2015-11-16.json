We are proud that school communities across the province are working hard to promote respectful and caring relationships and interactions during Bullying Awareness and Prevention week and all year long.", "As you may know, promoting well-being is one of the goals of our government’s renewed vision for education, Achieving Excellence. Ontario is leading the country with strong legislation and evidence-informed resources to address bullying and victimization through prevention and intervention. For example, the Accepting Schools Act, which was passed in 2012, requires school boards to take measures to prevent and address inappropriate student behaviour. This important legislation is helping to make every school in Ontario a safe, inclusive and accepting place to learn, while at the same time ensuring that every student has the support to reach their full potential.", "Another way we are promoting well-being is through the updated health and physical education curriculum. From a very early age, students will learn to demonstrate respect for all and understand the root causes of gender inequality, while also building skills for developing healthy relationships.", "Our safe and accepting schools teams, which are required in all Ontario schools, are helping to create a safe, inclusive and accepting school climate for our students all across the province. Speaker, you will recall that the 2014-15 Premier’s Awards for Accepting Schools recognized Ontario’s safe and accepting school teams for the exceptional and innovative work they have done. For the 2014-15 school year, 10 school teams were selected as recipients for these initiatives.", "One such school is St. Alfred Catholic Elementary School in St. Catharines, which launched its Caught You Caring bullying prevention campaign. This recognized individual students throughout the school for their positive choices and impact on their school.", "Another school, École élémentaire catholique Lamoureux in Ottawa, responded to the challenge of creating a positive student climate with its Stop, Walk, and Talk campaign. In fact, a school climate survey at école Lamoureux revealed that more than 97% of students felt strongly that they were helped, supported, respected and felt safe at school, and the school has experienced a marked drop in bullying incidents over the past two years.", "I encourage every member in the House today and in our school communities to take this opportunity, not just during Bullying Awareness and Prevention Week but throughout the school year, to promote respectful and healthy relationships, to take a stand against bullying, and to come together to make a difference in the lives of Ontario’s children, students, families, and educators." ],

In 2010, she introduced a resolution calling on the government to recognize the third week of November each year as Bullying Awareness and Prevention Week. In addition to her resolution, she introduced a private member’s bill in 2011 to strengthen anti-bullying laws in schools.", "I also want to thank Lisa MacLeod, the member for Nepean–Carleton, who has also been a champion in our caucus against bullying. In 2012, she brought forward legislation to recognize the third Sunday in November as Bullying Awareness and Prevention Week in schools, including establishing a plan to prevent bullying in school boards.", "I want to thank them both for their efforts to highlight how bullying is impacting our communities. There is no doubt that bullying is a serious issue that continues in our society, and especially in our schools, having serious implications in the lives of our students.", "There are many forms of bullying, whether it is about a person’s race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, intellect and/or physical disabilities, and no longer is bullying confined to classrooms and schoolyards. Even in workplaces, bullying exists, and with social media, bullying has easy access to individuals no matter where they are. Now bullying can take place right in a person’s home, digitally.", "Cyber-bullying is the new modern-day plague, quickly spreading. For example, at least one in three adolescents in Canada has reported being bullied recently, and nearly half of all parents across Canada report having a child who is a victim of bullying. To highlight this even more, a child or teen is bullied every seven minutes on playgrounds throughout Canada. Bullying has serious effects on the lives of our province’s children.", "Victims of harassment report a loss of interest in school activities, more absenteeism, lower-quality school work, lower grades, more skipping and dropping classes, tardiness and truancy.", "To make matters worse, more than half of bullied children do not report being bullied to a teacher. When the majority of victims of bullying do not want to talk about their experience, they will resort to other means to cope with it, and in some cases it can lead to suicide. Suicide should never become an option for coping.", "That is why we need to do a better job of teaching children, if they are being bullied, to please reach out and talk to someone. Programs like the Kids Help Phone are there for you. We need to ensure that victims of bullying know that there is always someone out there to talk to. We need to teach family members, teachers and employers how to spot the signs that someone is being bullied.", "I want to commend the Police Association of Ontario for teaming up with Kids Now Canada in the “Pink is the New Blue” campaign to help raise awareness for the use of social media, in which parents, caregivers, officers and teachers can take an online quiz on how to identify potential situations and on how to listen to a child if they are being bullied. When we are able to teach individuals to spot the warning signs of someone being bullied, then we are better preparing them to deal with the situation appropriately.", "Here at Queen’s Park, we must show leadership by working together to put an end to all forms of bullying." ],

Bullying impacts all aspects of life in this province. Seniors, students, special needs citizens, transgender youth and visible minorities—sadly, anyone, Speaker—may experience bullying directly or indirectly. This aggressive and damaging behaviour can take place in the workplace, home, school or in the general public.", "Each generation of Ontarians is faced with new forms of bullying. In 2015, bullying has taken to cyberspace and occurs on varying public forums such as our social media platforms. As bullying increasingly involves new technology, so too must the individual seeking to stop this behaviour and to assist those living in fear or distress.", "Bringing individuals together to form community-based approaches to end bullying is a proven tactic to make real change. It is this community response that is the key to our success in reducing all forms of bullying, new and old.", "For instance, the Windsor police took part in the Yellowcard campaign that seeks to end intellectual discrimination. This campaign was launched by Special Olympics athletes working in conjunction with local police forces across Canada.", "Each year, Windsor’s Hiatus House takes part in the Shine the Light campaign in partnership with organizations and businesses across our community to raise awareness on the lack of domestic violence reporting. On my way back to Queen’s Park this week, I had the opportunity to stop in London, and I noticed many of the private businesses and public institutions were taking part in the Shine the Light campaign: Their buildings were lit up in purple. Speaker, this campaign actually takes place across our province to bring awareness to the lack of reporting on domestic violence.", "Another local initiative is the Essex County Diversion Program. Through its youth outreach initiative, the diversion program seeks to raise awareness of activities that can be attributed to bullying and accepts referrals from parents and schools. I hope this program can continue to partner with the community and offer its services.", "Across Ontario, the parents, education workers, and students who make up our education communities are leaders in bullying awareness and prevention. In the past, school-based initiatives in Windsor, like H.J. Lassaline Catholic Elementary School’s Bully Busters program or Catholic Central’s Delete Day, have increased awareness and reduced forms of bullying in schools.", "It is the hard work of our education community that delivers the ministry and school board directives aimed at bullying prevention that the minister spoke of today. Whether the anti-bullying initiative is a directive of the ministry, the board, or a grassroots campaign at a local school, our education workers and principals are foundational to bullying prevention inside and outside the classroom. These education workers go above and beyond what is required of them each and every day to deliver on these directives and so much more. Their input is vital to measuring the impact and success of these programs.", "We need to recognize the value that education workers voluntarily bring each and every day to Ontario students through anti-bullying initiatives. This is why Ontario families are so troubled by the divisive tactics this government has used over the past several months to divide our education community. Most recently, we see this by the government granting boards the ability to reduce the pay of our education professionals in an attempt to force education support staff into submission in an ongoing labour dispute.", "While the government issued an ultimatum, they have yet to give support staff the courtesy of setting more dates to bargain, have their concerns heard, and reach a tentative agreement. It is shameful that this government is pitting school boards against education workers and against parents, all in an attempt to get its way.", "Speaker, we need a cohesive and united community of parents, students and education workers if our efforts to curb behaviour and assist the victims of bullying are to be effective. The government should work to unite this community rather than pit members against one another. Only through a united education community will we be successful in ending new forms of bullying in this province. We need this government to recognize this and start working to unite this community rather than create divides." ],

Like the House leader for the Conservatives, I’ve been here for some years now. Normally, there’s a little bit of a chance for members to be able to get a bill in order to be able to read it, in order to understand it, in order to, hopefully, consult with people who may be affected by it, so that we can have a meaningful debate in this Legislature.", "Instead, the government introduced this bill just a short time ago and then told us at the last minute that they’re going to call it for debate this afternoon. Fair enough. They have the right to do that. They are the government. They did win a majority in the last election, and the government House leader controls the agenda of the House. I get it. But, God, it’s not a good way of doing things.", "As you look at this particular bill—I’ve only had a chance to read the explanatory notes and I’ve read about half of the bill, and I’ve got more questions about this bill than I have had about a whole bunch of others. If I understand what the government is doing here, it simply is that they’re taking away—we created, under the Conservatives, a number of agencies in the electricity sector: the OEB, the Ontario Energy Board, which was there before, but they were given a new mandate, and the IESO, the people who essentially approve projects in the energy sector, and others. These people who had the responsibility to manage the growth and the changes in the electricity system had a process that they had to go through that was somewhat transparent. It probably wasn’t as good as people would like. I know that on a number of projects, people showed up at community meetings in my riding in order to deal with some of the projects that were brought forward. But people did have a right, because those agencies had a responsibility under law to consult and to go out and to do hearings on a particular project.", "So let’s say, for example, there would be an application to build a new transmission line between Sudbury and Timmins. Something like that would be subject to an environmental assessment, and there would also have to be hearings by the Ontario Energy Board in order to say, “Here’s what we plan on doing. Here’s what we think it’s going to look like.” Then people would come and have their say, and say, “Hey, what a great idea,” or, “What a bad idea,” and, if it’s great or bad, give the reasons why. It’s a process within a democracy that allows people to have a say about how their public utility system is being designed and being managed and being operated in a way that makes some sense.", "If I understand this legislation correctly—correct me if I’m wrong—essentially what they’re doing is giving the minister all of the power to do the planning, all of the power to tell the OEB, the IESO and others what he or she wants in his or her plan, when it has to be done, and all of the details of whatever it is. There’s no accountability, because from what I can see in here, the right to an environmental assessment on projects like that is taken away in this legislation. I hope that, in the time that we have this bill at second reading, people will get a chance to read this bill and have that discussion a little bit greater. But that is troubling. We went through it on the Green Energy Act when it came to the windmills or the solar farms that were built across Ontario.", "The idea of going green is a great idea. Who’s going to argue with greening your electricity system? I don’t think anybody opposes the concept in itself. But there has to be a public process by which the public buys in.", "If there was one criticism, especially in rural Ontario and somewhat in northern Ontario—but in rural Ontario mostly—about the process, it’s that it took away the ability of the public to really have their say. Municipalities couldn’t, within their own boundaries, do anything about those projects as they were being planned, and the environmental assessment process was really null and void, if I’m correct.", "Now what they’re doing is saying, under this new private hydro that they’re creating—because they’re essentially privatizing hydro. They’re taking a public utility that we used to own 100%, and over a period of time the government is selling 60%. The government says that they’re going to still control electricity and they’re going to still control Hydro One with that particular setup. But you know as well as I do that if you sell 60% of your business, you don’t call the shots anymore. Everybody in the business world knows that. Everybody who works for a business knows that. The public knows that. If you don’t have 50% plus 1% of the business, you’re not in control.", "What this bill does, under this new hydro system—it says that if the new Hydro One or whatever they call themselves decide that they’re going to build a transmission project wherever or they’re going to change a substation wherever or they’re going to build God knows what on the generation side, it’s not subject to an environmental assessment. Wow. What happened to the progressive Liberals who ran in the last election? I remember that those Liberals, Kathleen Wynne and others, were out there campaigning, “Oh, we’re the progressive ones.

I can’t believe it.", "I hope I’m wrong. I’m sure there’s going to be a government member, learned scholars that they are on this legislation—because God knows they must have read it before I got it, because we just got this bill—who is going to maybe point this wrong. But I don’t think I’m wrong. If you take a look at what the bill says and the explanatory notes and you read what it says inside the bill itself, it’s pretty darn clear. It makes changes to section 25 of the bill, and it says it “is re-enacted to provide the power for the minister, subject to the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council”—that’s cabinet—“to issue directives to the IESO and to the boards that set out requirements respecting the implementation of the long-term energy plan.” Well, essentially, the minister draws up the energy plan." ],

There are people on both sides of that issue—people in favour and people opposed—and the OEB held hearings in Ontario so that people could have a discussion about, “Should that project go forward: yes? Should it go forward: no? And if yes or if no, give your reasons.” The OEB came back and gave its report, and now people have to go back and deal with some of the concerns that were raised on that particular project.", "Well, what I’m seeing here is that something like that would be pretty hard to happen unless the government wanted to have a public process. Certainly the government retains the right, as I read the legislation, to be able to have a public process hearing of some type, in order to give the public their say, because there is a section in this bill that refers to the minister having the ability to create a public consultation process on development of his or her energy plan—clearly. But it’s not an independent process driven by some outside body that is a third party and is not tied to the decision. That’s what a review process is supposed to be all about. That would be like saying, “Well, you know, you just charged somebody, and let me tell you: I, the prosecution, or I, the defence, am going to pick all the jurors.” I can tell you what’s going to happen with the decision: If you get to pick the jurors, the jurors are going to do what you want.", "You have to have a system where there are some checks and balances, and the checks and balances in the system are to make sure that it’s transparent. What the government seems to be doing with this bill—and I’ve got to say, it’s going to take a little bit of time to go through and read this bill, and certainly we need people to come and speak to this in committee who are knowledgeable on the energy sector—is that this bill seems to essentially give the minister the power to determine what an energy plan is going to look like when it comes to distribution, transmission and generation. They develop the energy plan, and the minister can—because the minister has the ability in this legislation to have a public process, as far as consultation, and having people come before and say what they have to say, but only if the minister chooses, and only on those items that the minister chooses to put into the review process. There’s no independent environmental assessment process where there is an independent body who is looking at the project and reporting back on what that is.", "The IESO and the Ontario Energy Board were set up so that they have some independent processes they have to go through as well. If Hydro One or OPG wanted to do a particular project somewhere in Ontario, the IESO—depending on the part of the project—or the OEB, the Ontario Energy Board, would have the ability and the responsibility to do third-party verification of what’s going on and to conduct hearings.", "What we’re essentially doing in this bill is taking that responsibility away from the OEB and the IESO. They are, essentially, now extensions of the minister’s office. The minister will say to the OEB or the IESO, “Jump,” and the IESO and the OEB are going to say, “How high, Minister? And when do you want me to come down?” The way this bill is written, it takes away the independence of those agencies.", "I was opposed to Mike Harris when he originally broke up hydro and put them into five or six different organizations and did what he did, because we always thought at the time that creating five or six organizations costs more money to run than when you have one. It only stands to reason.", "At least the Conservatives left in place a certain process within these new agencies that gave the system some transparency. In this case, the minister is in the driver’s seat. The minister, first of all, decides if there’s going to be any kind of review or type of hearing on whatever the project or the energy plan might be be—if and when it’s going to happen, how long it’s going to happen, and what the terms of reference are going to be when it comes to the actual hearing. At the end, the minister is in total control of what he or she does with the information when it comes back from the consultation process. There’s no requirement that the minister has to do anything. It only says that the minister has to take into account what they’ve consulted on when it comes to the energy plan, if they decide to do the consultation in the first place. So they can decide to have a consultation or not. If they do it, they choose the terms of reference, and that means everything about how those hearings will take place. And when it comes back, the minister doesn’t even have to take it into account. It says the minister may take it into account.", "So we move from a system where the OEB and the IESO had some requirements that were given by this Legislature in order to make sure that there was at least some amount of transparency and some kind of accountability for the decisions they made, to assist them, to now, where they’re going to, basically, jump to the minister’s bark. When the minister barks, they’re going to have to jump. It’s as simple as that. I don’t think the OEB or the IESO would like to have that. I think at the end of the day, they probably would rather have a system that is a bit more independent. I think it’s just dangerous to go down this path.", "I want to repeat what the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane said—he said it in jest, but he’s darn well serious: These are the guys who designed the energy system that we have now that’s in so much trouble, and we’re going to trust them with this type of legislation, where they’re going to be able to design what the energy plan is based on their own feelings and whatever it is that they want?

Xstrata was the largest single utility customer in the province of Ontario with this refinery and smelter. Why did they close down? Electricity prices, pure and simple.", "I sat at the meeting we had with Mayor Laughren; the heads of Xstrata; the head of Unifor; Charlie Angus; myself; the Premier then, Mr. McGuinty; and the minister—I can’t remember who the minister was.

Without that, we can’t stay and operate in Ontario.”", "What the government has now done with Hydro One privatization is put at risk, again, rates to go up, because rates will go up. Nobody is going to pay a CEO $4 million a year and expect that it’s not going to push the rate up. Nobody is going to privatize 60% of the system and say of the shareholders, “They’re just buying this because they want to be good to Ontarians and they want you to have a better deal.” I don’t think so.

I have got to tell you, if this bill takes us down the direction anywhere near as good as the Hydro One privatization has gone so far, you should all be bowing with respect. The reality is that we set up a process with an IPO which predicted a certain value for the corporation. The Financial Accountability Officer made his assessment and, looking at the full range of the financing options, he had some concern if the values came in at the low end of the range. But as it turned out, the values of the IPO came out at the high end of the range, we realized immediate sales of all the shares that were put up for option, and, in a glorious way, the very same day they’re up 6%.", "The people who actually made that investment recognized that there is tremendous value here to move forward with. Now, when we go out for the next 15%, let’s see where those share prices are then. Because, as we suggested might happen, if it shows an even greater value, because we didn’t sell it all off at once, we’re going to go forward with an even higher share value and get even more money to pay down debt and invest in infrastructure in the province. That’s very important.", "But what the member will know, if he reads in more detail, is that we are setting in place a long-term energy planning process which probably, had this been done earlier, might have caught some of the problems associated with having gas plants zoned inappropriately for the communities that had grown up around them over the years that they had that opportunity.", "Speaker, I look forward to more debate on this in the House.

The debt we get to keep, we get 60% of what it’s worth, and the other 40% is in that nowhere-land of “Who owns it?”", "When we did things like come up with smart meters, smart people tell me their smart bills went up, so those smart meters didn’t save us very much money.

They have a huge amount of hydroelectricity which they like to sell, because that’s good business, selling their natural-resource-driven, water-driven power. They run a power line through the province of Ontario to the New England states to power our American neighbours—our good neighbours who don’t happen to want our pipeline, by the way, but maybe we’ll have a new president next year and we’ll fix that problem. That would be energy conservation as well.", "But what we could have done was to buy hydroelectricity from our Quebec neighbours, instead of hundreds of billions of dollars that we’re going to spend on green and solar energy over the next 20 years—and sending it to Korea, or France, or offshore.

There are a few things that I think about.", "First of all I think about how important it is that we manage our sector effectively to make sure we support our economy. I was at an event on Saturday in the community and was talking to a gentleman who runs a business and employs many people. He talked about how important it is that we have affordable, reliable energy supply in our communities to support our businesses in Ontario.", "Speaker, by the way, I’d like to mention that I’d like to share my time with the member from Halton and the Minister of Government and Consumer Services. I neglected to mention that; my apologies.", "Again, this business person was talking about the importance of our energy sector. He was talking about how some of his colleagues had done work in other parts of the world, and how the higher costs they face there and the lack of reliability caused problems for them, an expanding industry in those jurisdictions. As an example, this gentleman highlighted—and we’ve heard it from our constituents; we’ve all heard it—how important it is to our economy.", "It’s also important to our quality of life. I was in a civics class last week, during constituency week, and was talking with young people in a grade 5 class about the three levels of government: what the provincial government does, what the federal government is responsible for and what the municipal government is responsible for. One of the things we inevitably started talking about at the provincial level was energy and how important it is.", "It was interesting talking with the students about that, because it wasn’t one of the issues they had initially raised. Initially, they talked about things like education, the police and health care. These are, of course, also important priorities for the provincial government. But it was interesting, when we got into energy, that they started to realize how it touched their lives every day: how their iPads were powered by hydro, how so much of what they do every day is dependent on the energy sector. It was interesting to see them develop that appreciation. All that said, obviously a strong, reliable energy sector—affordable energy but also reliable energy—is fundamental to our economy and fundamental to our quality of life.", "Speaker, as you may have heard me say before in this House, I come from a business background. One of the things that well-run businesses and well-run organizations do well is that they plan for the future. They look ahead and determine what they, as an organization, want to achieve three, five, 10 years from now. What are their ambitions? I’m not talking about ambitions like being profitable; I’m talking about what markets they want to compete in, where they want to be successful, what sort of risks they face and how they insulate themselves against those kinds of risks. Then, what are the steps they need to take to make sure they’re prepared to seize opportunities and also protect themselves or mitigate those risks?", "To me, one of the things my experience in business has taught me is the importance of long-term planning and thoughtful planning, and doing it in a way that is not only rigorous but transparent to the executives in the organization who initially developed the plan, but also transparent to the board and ultimately to the broader shareholders who need to be able to buy into what the executive team has developed as far as their long-term strategic plan.", "That brings me to what is in the bill—one of the components in the bill, anyway, that I think is positive, which is the reforms that would be made to long-term energy planning if this bill were passed. Now, long-term energy planning is something this government is already doing very significantly. If I can just check, in 2010 and 2013, the government developed long-term energy plans to guide energy planning and advance energy policy initiatives.", "These long-term energy plans are really important. Not unlike the example I gave of the business that plans for the future, long-term energy plans for our province really help ensure that we are appropriately making investments in the right places, whether that is in generation or transmission, which then further reinforces or supports the fact that we’ve made investments in a cost-effective way, and therefore that rates are kept as low as possible for consumers, but also that we provide stable, reliable energy for people into the future and support the economy and quality of life that I was referring to earlier.", "When I think about some these things, it requires that we think about where our economy is going. What are the demands going to be? What does residential electricity use look like, and what will it be into the future? These are the kinds of things an effective plan would consider, I would think, and this government has been doing that, like I said, in 2010 and 2013.", "What this legislation does is really enshrine an effective and transparent process into legislation. Doing this would ensure, like I said, a consistent, transparent, long-term planning process is followed, and it would require that this planning process be done in consultation with stakeholders. Just like the example I gave with the business that consults with its board, its shareholders, its customers or its clients, similarly here, this would require broad consultation on that long-term energy plan to make sure that it is done properly. The members opposite were talking about how important consultation is, and that’s exactly what has been baked into this bill and would be baked into the long-term energy planning process.", "Speaker, what I’d like to do is just talk a little bit about that in more detail. As I said, in 2010 and 2013, our government developed long-term energy plans, and what these do is set out a comprehensive direction for the energy sector. They were developed through an extensive consultation process, I understand, with consumers, with stakeholders and with aboriginal groups throughout Ontario. So this bill would enshrine this long-term energy planning process to ensure that it is done transparently and pragmatically and that future long-term energy plans are developed consistently with principles of cost-effectiveness, reliability and clean energy. These are the kinds of things that I think we can all get our heads around and support, because these are strong principles as far as strong financial management of how we support our energy sector, but also ensure, again, like I said from the beginning, that we support our economy, our industry and the quality of life that the people of Ontario rely on.", "As a first step in the planning process, the Minister of Energy would request that the IESO develop and submit a technical report setting out the current status of the electricity system, including the adequacy and reliability of current resources. “What’s the inventory of what we have today, and is it adequate?” is basically what that means. The report would create a starting point for the development of the long-term energy plan in order to guide the consultation process which would follow. This would be, of course, made available to the public ahead of those consultations.", "The Minister of Energy would be authorized to develop long-term energy plans that would set out the government’s goals and objectives with respect to specified matters. Again, consistent with our Open Government Initiative, Mr. Speaker, which I’m sure you have heard a lot about and which cuts across ministries in government, when developing a long-term energy plan, a significant amount of consultation would be required with stakeholders, consumers, First Nations communities and Métis communities. The minister would be required to consider that input that he received during the consultation during the long-term energy planning process.", "To ensure that the public and stakeholders are able to participate in the consultation process, the proposed legislation would require that consultation include in-person meetings and the opportunity to provide input electronically. So if people want to do it in person, they can, but obviously we live in an electronic age, and that opportunity would be there as well.", "I want to leave some time for my fellow caucus members to speak to this bill, because I know they’re eager to do that. I think, in summary, what I want to say is that effective management and planning of our electricity system is fundamental to our economy. It’s fundamental to our quality of life. We all know that. The business person that I spoke to over the weekend told me that. The children in the grade 5 class that I spoke to talked to me about that. When you have something that’s important like that, it’s important that you plan. Just like any good business plans, just like the government plans for the future, it’s important that we have a plan for our energy sector to make sure the people of Ontario can rely on sustainable energy, reliable energy, clean energy and affordable energy for years to come. That’s how we will support a strong economy and that’s how we’ll continue to support a strong quality of life here in Ontario." ],

One of the most important things that it does is to enable our government to plan in the long term. Long-term energy planning is key, and we’ve heard that so many times from Ontarians out there. What this does is it puts a process in place that is transparent and efficient and enables us to respond to the changing policy and system needs.", "This key change is vital, because we need long-term energy planning and we need a process in place to do this. It’s key for Ontarians. It simplifies and makes the system predictable and efficient, and increases responses. It allows us to plan for the future, to plan when it comes to things like generation, transmission lines or nuclear energy. We need to be able to know what we’re doing in the next few years and to plan for that future.", "In addition, we are coming up with two new initiatives to help Ontario families, businesses and the province conserve energy and water. I can’t tell you how important that is. I have young children, and my children are very concerned about the environment. It’s important that our government lead the way, not just for our province, but for our country and, actually, worldwide, because this is something that we know we are going to have to be prepared for. We know that our resources are valuable and we know that Canada has some very valuable resources when it comes to water and energy. What this will allow us to do is manage costs and protect our valuable resources.", "So, how are we going to do this? Well, what we are going to do is amend the Electricity Act, 1988 and the Ontario Energy Board Act by making sure that we’re replacing the current electricity planning process, known as the Integrated Power System Plan process and the long-term energy plan process, to empower the IESO to undertake competitive selection of procurement processes for electricity transmission projects when appropriate.", "This is important. Why? Well, when it comes to energy system planning, this will ensure that we are using plans and principles that are consistent with cost-effectiveness, that are reliable, clean energy, engaging the community and engaging our aboriginal community.", "When it comes to transmission, we are going to ensure that we are authorizing our plan to undertake competitive processes for transmitter selection and procurement to ensure that ratepayers get the greatest value from new infrastructure investments. It is important that we get plans in place to ensure we are getting the best deals when it comes to procuring the transmission projects and transmission lines that we need.", "We are also, as I mentioned earlier, bringing in some green energy assistance. One of our government’s key goals is energy conservation. Conservation helps families and businesses save money on their energy bills, reduces the need to build expensive energy infrastructure and reduces greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. This, of course, creates a cleaner future for our children and a cleaner environment.", "This legislation, if passed, would introduce two initiatives that are going to help Ontario families, businesses and the province as a whole to conserve energy. The energy and water reporting and benchmarking initiative for large buildings would require property owners to track buildings’ energy and water use and greenhouse gas emissions over time to allow owners and renters to determine how a building’s energy performance is changing and how it compares to similar buildings.", "In addition, the water efficiency standards for energy-consuming products and appliances would set water efficiency standards for products that consume both energy and water, like dishwashers and washing machines, allowing Ontarians to make the best choices for themselves when shopping for appliances.", "This basically gets down to planning. Our residents in Ontario have told us that they want us to ensure that the prices are kept down. We can do this by making sure that we are planning for the future. We want to make sure that we actually know what we are going to be doing in the next couple of years to get the best prices, to plan in the long term and to ensure that we are doing things in the proper way.", "When we came into government, that wasn’t quite how things were being done. Transmission lines were not being kept up with. Generators were not being looked after; our generating stations were not being looked after. We had to pour a lot of money into this system. That’s what drove our costs up. Now we’re making sure that we’re not in that situation again by planning for the future.", "Thank you so much for having me speak, Mr. Speaker." ],

We all know that all governments have faced significant challenges in the energy sector and in dealing with all elements of energy, whether it’s generation, transmission, distribution or conservation. All of the issues related to the sector have had huge challenges over the years, and our government is committed to getting this right, to working to ensure that we have a long-term energy plan that makes sense for Ontarians.", "We talk about energy generation and the importance of that. Certainly in my own riding and the area around Sault Ste. Marie, we have seen very significant projects come to life to help support energy capacity in Ontario. I think of the Brookfield energy wind farm, a 189-megawatt project, and the Starwood Energy solar farm, with 60 megawatts.", "I think of some of the other initiatives that we’ve moved forward to support industry with cogeneration and helping our major employer in our community reduce their energy need by about half. The steel mill in my riding uses about 140 megs of power, and they now have a cogeneration facility that is nearly 70 megawatts, reducing their emissions, reducing their costs significantly and making them more competitive globally. That’s a huge benefit to both the environment and to reducing generation capacity.", "We also have in my riding of Sault Ste. Marie the only solar panel manufacturer in northern Ontario, Heliene solar. There are about 70 jobs at this plant. They export this type of equipment all over the world. It’s about getting to these technological resources that we can help support other countries with, passing on our technology and helping to strengthen the economy here in Ontario.", "Importantly, other elements that have been mentioned during this afternoon’s discussion—things like smart meters have come up. We can talk about continuing to spend billions of dollars to build new generation in Ontario, or we can have people shift their usage of their energy to reduce peak periods where we’re using that energy. We’re either going to shift energy use and consumption from peak, so that we can reduce our costs, or we’re not going to do that and we’re going to say to Ontarians, “Look, it’s going to cost you billions of dollars to build more generation and more capacity.”", "On this side of the House, we believe—and I think most of our colleagues across the way would say—that saving and conserving energy, and shifting some of that use to keep it off peak periods, would help in our long-term energy plan, and would help to reduce the cost to Ontarians of having to continue to build more very, very expensive generation capacity.", "I think it’s certainly worthy of note that in the proposed legislation, the commitment around—I’ve heard members from the opposition talk about the arbitrary nature of the minister, the cabinet and the government potentially determining the long-term energy plan, but that’s not the case. The fact of the matter is that this legislation would ensure consistent, transparent long-term energy planning that would enshrine in law extensive consultation with stakeholders and aboriginal groups in the development of long-term energy planning.", "This is an important element in terms of how these plans will be put together. They shouldn’t be put together in isolation, or in a vacuum, so to speak. They should be plans that are well thought out, where we work with all Ontarians to ensure they reflect the views and values of all Ontarians. That way we will get the best possible plan to be able to move forward.", "I think it’s also important that there are a number of other initiatives that are key parts of this legislation: the energy and water reporting and benchmarking, which we know will help to reduce costs, save consumers money and be more effective; as well as the water efficiency standards for energy-consuming products and appliances, another important element to this piece of legislation." ],

I heard the MPP for Halton talking about her children and how she fears for their future. I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I fear for the future generations in this province when it comes to jobs. Will there be jobs in Ontario, well-paying jobs, with the government’s current long-term energy plan? We know, according to their own documents, that over the next three years, energy bills are going to go up by almost 50%. By 2018, businesses, homeowners—those bills are going up, I think, about 42%. We already have the highest energy rates in all of North America, and their plan is to increase the cost.", "Life is already unaffordable in the province of Ontario, Mr. Speaker. I don’t have to remind any government members about the loss of manufacturing jobs that we’ve seen under their watch. Over 300,000 well-paying manufacturing jobs have vanished from the province. This government’s plan is to drive more jobs out of Ontario. I think what we need in Ontario is an economic plan to create jobs.

I think we’re all aware of the importance of that.", "In my local context—I only have, as I said, a couple of minutes—I can talk about how long-term planning is important to northwestern Ontario and my community of Thunder Bay–Atikokan.", "People will remember that back in 2003, all three political parties committed to closing coal-fired generation in the province of Ontario. There were five coal-fired generating facilities in the province that generated about 5,000 megawatts or 6,000 megawatts of energy. About 20% of the total provincial output was generated from coal. Out of the five plants, two of them were in my riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan. What I want to underline here is that in terms of long-term energy planning, I don’t believe anybody was talking about how we were going to replace those 5,000 megawatts or 6,000 megawatts of energy, even though all three parties had committed to removing coal from the generation mix.", "When it came to security of energy supply, given the constrictions on the east-west tie line, the loss of those two coal-fired plants in Thunder Bay and in Atikokan and for all of northwestern Ontario potentially could have had significant consequences. Our government stepped up to the plate. We spent somewhere in the order of magnitude of $200 million to convert the plant in Thunder Bay and the plant in Atikokan, to not only keep those jobs in those communities and that tax base in the community, but as part of a long-term energy planning mix ensuring that the long-term energy security needs of northwestern Ontario can be met." ],

In Parry Sound–Muskoka, the provincial incomes are below average. Generally speaking, those on the lower end of the income scale tend to have electric baseboard heat. I’m getting calls, on a daily basis, from people who are being threatened with their hydro being cut off, who just can’t afford to pay for the electricity costs in the province of Ontario.", "They’ve talked about the smart meter program.

Conservation is fundamental. Of course, there will continue to be growing demand for energy, but things like shifting from peak through the use of smart meters—although there are concerns around them to some extent, the reality is, those concerns pale in comparison to the costs that Ontarians would bear to build new, very, very expensive generation capacity in the province of Ontario.", "The other aspect that I think is very important to note is with respect to the accountability and the oversight in regard to energy planning. When we talk about the OEB and the IESO, who are they accountable to? We’re talking about making the long-term energy plan part of the minister’s responsibilities—cabinet and the government—and enshrining in legislation the requirement for extensive consultation with the public, with stakeholders, with aboriginal groups in the development of these plans.

Mainly, they point to two new trends: One is that they’re setting up Ontarians for forced home energy audits and new consumption taxes; the second is to centralize all transmission and electricity sector planning with the energy minister’s political staff, which means overruling industry experts at the IESO and OEB. In other words, Bill 135 will allow government to drive energy policy in a direction that’s best for their party, not for the people of Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, I think you’ll recall that we used to have here in Ontario the lowest rates in North America, and under this 12-year reign of terror with these Liberals, we now have the highest rates across North America. Just recently, one of my colleagues—I believe from Parry Sound–Muskoka—advised that an 8% increase was on your bill as of November 1.

The point is, no one can object to any project rolled out by the Liberal government, even if it’s unaffordable, even if it’s unnecessary, meaning this government is giving itself the legal ability to saddle all of us with the full cost of any future energy contracts without any repercussions. Just think of the recent fire sale of Hydro One.", "Another example: They quietly ushered in wind turbines without any cost-benefit analysis, without any consultations and without any consideration of the impact on ratepayers. I have to share in this House again that I continually hear that from my people back in the great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, particularly the municipal representatives, who have had no ability to have any say in this legislation. They are the people closest to it, they’re the people who hear the most about it, and yet they have virtually not even the ability to comment on it. They can comment, but there’s really no impact that they can change anything.", "The Green Energy Act is the epitome of this government’s wishful thinking and dashed hopes, and, most importantly, proof that sensible energy policies cannot be developed by the energy minister’s office alone. I’m going to talk a little bit more about the Green Energy Act, because it certainly, in my four years, has been one of the key things that we’ve all talked about, one of the things that I hear the most about continually. And it’s not just the Green Energy Act; it’s the impact of that Green Energy Act decision on the needs and realities of everyday Ontarians.", "After the Liberals rolled out their Green Energy Act in 2009, they quickly came to learn that their plan was holding Ontarians hostage to the most unaffordable plan ever implemented in this province. The unaffordable subsidies to the wind and solar companies and the so-called global adjustment were zapping ratepayers with unprecedentedly high rates.", "Chapman’s Ice Cream in Markdale was getting zapped with a global adjustment of $1 million. That’s hard to even fathom. I remember our then energy critic, Vic Fedeli, came up and we had a round table not only with the Chapmans but in their facility with a number of business people from the Markdale community and Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound proper. It was very interesting to have that frank discussion, particularly with a big company like Chapman’s. They have a 160,000-square-foot warehouse on Highway 10, which many people, if they’ve been up the highway, will know, and that’s totally on the energy grid. You could just see the wheels turning, of: “How is this going to impact me? Where is this going to go down the road? How are we going to sustain and stay profitable and viable?” They provide 600-plus jobs in a relatively small, rural community.", "The one thing that really came out of there is that this global adjustment is something that the government has used to basically just pull money from the taxpayer to pay these subsidies, and to pay, by the way—it’s a misnomer that I continually hear out in our communities about giving money, giving power to the States and to Quebec. We don’t actually give it away; we pay for it. I’m going to talk a little bit here shortly about just how much. We don’t give it away; we actually pay other areas, other states and other provinces to take our surplus power, and yet this Liberal government wants to add more and more to the grid. It makes no sense, no matter which way you want to spin it.", "That’s just one example of the damaging impact the global adjustment charge is having on the energy bills of small and medium-sized businesses in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. I hear it from M&M Meat Shops. I hear it from the grocery stores. I hear it from the manufacturing community. I hear it from just about any business out there that has a significant role that’s needed for their industry to be driven forward in energy. How can they continually hear that there’s going to be another almost 50% increase over the next four years and accept that that is just going to be status quo and we’re going to have to absorb it? Most of those products and services that they’re making and manufacturing cannot sustain that type of an increase and stay viable going forward.", "Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk determined in her report that the global adjustment will have cost Ontarians $50 billion by the end of this year.

Hydro One is a valuable asset that they have put up for fire sale, an asset that members of that party and their former leader and Premier said was the wrong thing to do. The Financial Accountability Officer, releasing his report on the financial impact of the partial sale of Hydro One, said it’s a bad deal in the long term for the people of Ontario.", "The Wynne Liberals have recklessly proceeded with the fire sale of Hydro One despite opposition, as I said, from 185 municipalities and nearly 80% of Ontarians.

The Financial Accountability Officer projects that as a result of the fire sale, the province’s fiscal situation would be worse than if they didn’t sell Hydro One, mostly because of the revenue that Hydro One currently brings into the provincial coffers.", "The fire sale could cost the province approximately $700 million in revenue every year, and the net profit from the sale could be as low as $1.4 billion for infrastructure funding. I think someone else in the House has even said we could probably borrow that money at today’s interest rates and be ahead without giving up that asset that is a perpetual source of revenue for us, Mr. Speaker.", "The report also predicts that the Hydro One fire sale will impact ratepayers. Coupled with the OEB’s recent announcement that hydro rates increased on November 1 by 8%, average Ontario families will continue to struggle to pay their hydro bills.", "Now that there’s no turning back from a bad deal, will the Liberals tell the truth about why they are selling Hydro One? Will they at least hold off and not sell the remaining shares? The public does not support this fire sale. We all know that. We are asking them to do it. They are trying to cover this thing up and come out with a budget and say, “Look how well we have done with our revenue.” Short-term gain for long-term pain is the message I have heard from many of my elders who are trying to implant with us the wisdom of how to govern for the long term and what is best in the long term of Ontarians.", "For that side of the House to talk about Bill 135 as a bill to legislate consultation on future energy policy is truly disingenuous. I guess my only question left to them is: What is section 7 all about? Are you seriously going to force home energy audits on people now? It certainly reads like Ontarians are about to be forced into home energy audits and new taxes on conservation and consumption. It sounds like another scandal brewing. Mr. Speaker, we need baseload power. I’m one who always stands, as our caucus nuclear committee chair, saying, “There is baseload power.” We need to be doing that. We need to be making sure that that is an essential part of our mix going forward, and that we make the commitment, not doing some of the ideas of selling off some of our other power sources now just to make their financial situation look good.", "Mr. Speaker, we certainly have some challenges here with Bill 135, and we want to make sure that it’s open and transparent to all Ontarians." ],

They simply can’t compete in Ontario any longer, as the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound indicated.

Basically, the bill does a number of things to a number of different acts. The first one, and the one that has been talked about the most, but I think it’s because it is that important, has to do with long-term energy planning. We all know that energy is not something where you get up one morning and decide, “Oh, we need a new transmission line here or we need more generation capacity here or we need a new nuclear refurbishment at billions of dollars.” This is something that needs to be planned, and you need a long-term plan.", "Ontario has a long-term energy plan, as we speak, but this plan was done in a way completely different from the way it will be done in the future, if this bill goes through. The bill would amend the Electricity Act to give the Minister of Energy—the minister himself or herself—rather than the Independent Electricity System Operator, better known as IESO—the Independent Electricity System Operator, right now, has the responsibility for the long-term planning of our electricity system. No more; it would be given to the minister, this person, whoever he or she is. The responsibility for developing a long-term energy plan would still have to be done at specific intervals and within regulations, but not by IESO anymore. The role of IESO would be to develop technical reports to inform the plan, but only when requested by the minister.", "This is important because if you don’t want to know something, all you have to do is not ask. But sometimes even the information you don’t want to know about should be taken into account, to make sure we do a good job for the people we represent, for the people of Ontario.", "There would be an obligation for the minister to consult with First Nations, consult with consumers, distributors, generators and transmitters, but there is no requirement that the long-term energy plan be reviewed by the OEB. This is reviewed now by the Ontario Energy Board; that is a safeguard that we have now. Right now, an independent third-party agency looks at the plan to see how we best meet the people of Ontario who—all of us need electricity, but how do we do this in a way that serves Ontarians? They’re going to be out of the picture. The minister will have this responsibility now to make sure we get this right, because we’re all talking—billions of dollars hang in the balance here. We have the OEB, who gets to oversee that plan—no more. Before, the long-term energy plan needed to be reviewed by the OEB, making sure that we did integration in the power system plan and all of this. All those requirements are done. We are now focusing on something that is very important, that is very costly, that has huge implications for each and every one of us because we all use electricity—we are now concentrating all that power on the shoulders of one individual, the minister. I don’t know why we would that.", "As it is, the way we have, the system to put our long-term energy plan right now—there are, I would say, shortcomings with that plan as it is, although they had all of this opportunity. Now all of this will be in the hands of one person, on the shoulders of the minister, and I think this is wrong. I think this is going in the wrong direction.", "I think that when information will only be given when asked for, this is the wrong way to go. If you know something that could have an impact on the energy plan and the energy system in this province, you shouldn’t be limited to giving your advice when the ministry asks you; you should be free to give advice to the minister because you know something that’s going on. There are hundreds of very knowledgeable people who work at the IESO who can give that feedback, and one person could not possibly, feasibly be able to know it all. This is going backwards.", "The second part of the bill—I already told you there are many parts to the bill—is the role of the IESO and the OEB in relation to the long-term energy plan. Here again, we’re looking at an amendment to the Electricity Act to give the minister—not only is he going to be in charge of the plan, but he or she will have the power to issue directives to the IESO and the OEB respecting the implementation of the long-term energy plan and requiring the IESO and the OEB to submit implementation plans for approval.", "We’re turning this completely on its head. Where we had seen that it serves the people of Ontario well to distance ourselves from the political process and put it in the hands of technical experts to put together a long-term energy plan for the people of Ontario, we have now decided that the system that will serve us better will be to have it all in the hands of a politician—on the shoulders of a politician—who not only will only give the experts the way to express themselves when he or she asks, but will also direct them.", "All of this concentration of power on the shoulders of one individual for a file that big makes no sense. There have already been really significant planning mistakes that have been done in this province that have cost us dearly. In this House, everybody will remember the gas plants that were supposed to go into Oakville and Mississauga. Well, you can drive by those and see the millions of dollars that were spent so that we did not get any electricity out of those plants. The Auditor General’s report told us that it was actually a $1-billion mistake that was made there. That is significant when, right now, the stability of our system is not always what it wants to be.", "We have generation capacity and transportation capacity in areas where we don’t need it anymore. I’m really happy that my colleague from Timmins–James Bay just walked in, because Xstrata used to be a big user of electricity, and that worked out pretty good, because we have, I would say, fairly large generation capacity right next to the Xstrata plant. So Ontario was generating electricity, and you had a consumer right beside that was gobbling it all up. It was a marriage made in heaven. Now we have all this generation capacity but nobody to buy the electricity because Xstrata, the biggest user, has gone to Quebec where they pay one third in electricity prices that they were paying a couple of kilometres further west when they were in Ontario. So now, the people using the system are left to pay a whole lot more for electricity that is not really needed anymore. It is needed in other parts of our province, but it is being generated right there in Timmins, and Timmins can only use so much electricity, when their industries close up shop one after another and cross over to Quebec because they are able to set up shop over there at a third of the price of what we pay here in Ontario. I’m just giving those as examples of how important it is to have a robust long-term plan for electricity and energy and how we have decided that the best way to do that in the future is to leave this on the shoulders of a politician who will only listen to the expert that we have put in place when he or she feels like it—not really good.", "Not far away from Timmins, in my riding, is Gogama.

We need it in every sector of the government, whether it be in health and education or energy. Long-term planning is something good and something we support, but how do you make a robust long-term plan? It is not by putting all that responsibility on the shoulders of a minister. It is by making sure that you have third parties who are knowledgeable, who bring evidence-based decision-making forward for the best of all of the ratepayers and for the best of the people who live here, and we are going in the exact opposite direction of that. We are taking agencies that are third-party, evidence-based agencies and telling them, “You will only give us information when we ask you, and you will only give us the information that we have asked you.

Perhaps we’ll have a chance to find out a bit more about that.", "But on the bill, I talked earlier about the minister going forward with a different long-term planning process. That’s the central theme of the bill. Of course, it’s no surprise for any of us here in the Legislature this afternoon that the opposition parties would use this bill as an opportunity to speak less about the bill itself and more about energy costs and energy pricing in the province of Ontario. That’s not a surprise. We would have expected that, and that’s exactly what has transpired here. It’s understandable to some degree because we all understand the sensitivity around energy pricing in the province of Ontario and, I would say, the energy file, period.", "This has been part of the discussion, I would say, since I was first elected in 2003. Energy transmission, generation, pricing, the OEB and the like have been a chronic, constant theme of discussion since I have been here for 12, going on 13, years. I would say that, for me—and I’m going to get to the energy costing piece of this soon. I remember very clearly that the argument that was being made in relation to forestry and the reason at least being put forward by opposition parties for the decline of forestry in Ontario was energy pricing. Speaker, this was a very spurious argument, I think it’s fair for me to say. In fact, when I’ve spoken about this publicly over the last 12 years, I have often given credit to the Conservatives, because they rarely would put forward energy pricing as a cause for the forestry decline in Ontario. They knew it wasn’t the case. It was primarily the third party, the NDP, that would continue to make the spurious argument that energy pricing was somehow responsible for the decline of forestry in Ontario.", "People following this argument, especially those in my riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan and northern Ontario, will know very well that forestry first started to get hammered before the global recession hit in 2008. In 2005, 2006, forestry, you could say, was the canary in the coal mine. For a variety of reasons, forestry was affected before any of the other industries that came to be affected by the global recession. There was a variety of factors that caused forestry to decline in the province of Ontario, just like it declined in BC and just like it declined in Quebec. I reference those two provinces because they are the other two major forestry jurisdictions in Canada, along with Ontario.", "So when the spurious argument around electricity pricing was being made, primarily by the NDP, trying to say that this is why forestry was declining, they would have ignored the examples like recessionary times that were coming, like the collapse of the housing market in the US, which most of our product in Ontario—about 90% or 95% of it is exported into the United States. So as goes the United States, pretty much so goes the forestry industry in Ontario. Then the housing market had declined. They would have ignored that point.", "They would have ignored the part that, when we were elected in 2003, the Canadian dollar was at around 73 cents and appreciated to $1.10 while we were in government. A 1% appreciation—a one-cent, rather, appreciation in the value of the Canadian dollar, representing about a $3-million hit to one company in Ontario, times 37 cents. But the opposition parties would have ignored that and, of course, they would have ignored other factors like global competition.", "Speaker, think about it. We listened to the opposition parties, and, again, primarily the NDP, say that forestry declined because of an increased cost in energy. They would have led people to believe that if only energy costs were lower, then nothing that had happened in forestry with the carnage and the loss of thousands of jobs would have occurred. Of course, that argument is absolutely ridiculous because if you think—even the most cursory investigation or attention to the matter would show people that this industry began to decline in 2005-06. We had only been in government for about two years by the time the industry had started to decline. It’s obvious to anyone who paid attention to the issue that electricity pricing had nothing to do with what was going on in forestry.", "Yes, it was one of those input factors for forestry that we could help to address and help the industry to get on its feet, stay on its feet and survive this downturn, which we did. We brought in several programs that helped to address that. But I listened to that argument for a very long time and I’ll tell you, Speaker, it was tough to listen to because there were actually people who were making life choices, who lived in those forestry-based communities, who thought, “Yes, come on, government. Just lower the price a little bit. Just take the cents per kilowatt hour down a little bit and my mill is going to start back up, or my sawmill will reopen.”", "Of course, Speaker, given all of the other factors that I listed here, anybody would have known that wasn’t the case. But people were making life decisions on that, and it was a spurious argument. You just had to look to BC and Quebec, which have always had lower energy costs than Ontario, because most of their energy is old and it’s hydraulic; they’re very fortunate that way. Well, those jurisdictions ended up with as many job losses in the forestry sector as did Ontario. So I just offer that as some background in terms of my broader discussion on this bill.", "I started off by saying that while the bill is primarily about a new long-term energy planning process in the province of Ontario, the opposition members have taken some time to focus their comments primarily on costs. I want to talk a little bit about that today, if I can, as well. I have heard others say that since we came to government, the cost of energy has increased by two and a half times. All right. Let’s talk a little bit about what went into those costs. I heard one of the Conservative members—I forget who was speaking a little bit earlier—who talked about that and was quoting numbers. Here is what I remember, and I stand to be corrected, but I think my memory is pretty good on this: When we came into government, the price of a kilowatt of energy in the province of Ontario was somewhere in the neighbourhood of about 4.3 cents a kilowatt hour. That will be used as the baseline—" ],

When the Conservatives were in government, before we formed government in 2003—and, again, there will be two-minuters from the opposition benches, and perhaps they can correct me if I’m wrong. But the way I remember it as well, Speaker, was that that 4.3 cents really wasn’t the true cost of power. They used that low-water mark to show how much the price has gone up to make the gap look bigger.", "But what I remember, Speaker—and again, I stand to be corrected, and I’m open to hearing the comments from the opposition members—was that the price was actually capped. They had actually capped it at 4.3 cents. It wasn’t the true price of power. As I recall, the true price of power was actually about 20% higher.

But If we think about it and think for a second that it really wasn’t 4.3 cents but was 5.3 or 5.5 or perhaps a little higher, we realize then that the increase really wasn’t as great as the opposition members would want it to sound like.", "But also, where was the money being made up from? If we don’t argue that the Conservatives had artificially capped the price of energy, how were we paying for it? Well, we were paying for it not from the rate base, but we were paying for it from the property tax base.", "Here is what the official opposition had done before we came into power in 2003: They had artificially capped the price of energy—unless somebody wants to tell me I’m wrong—because they knew it was politically unpalatable to charge people, on their energy bills, the true cost of that energy, and they had transferred that extra cost, that extra approximately 20%, off your rate base and onto your tax base.", "Okay, let’s discuss that. If that’s your policy position, that’s fine, but let’s just make sure we’re clear on it. As I understand it, that’s what they did. I’m making my point only insofar as to suggest that when we talk about that gap, the two and a half times, I would ask the opposition members to maybe tell me what it is, if I’m correct that you had actually capped it and it was really 20% higher when we came in. What’s the number then? That’s point one.", "What else is a cost driver when it comes to the price of electricity in the province of Ontario, Speaker? Coal replacement policy, right? In 2003, all three political parties committed in their platforms to closing coal. Coal was 20% of total generated capacity in the province—5,000 or 6,000 megawatts of energy. I ask the opposition parties—and perhaps in their comments back, they can tell me—what their plan was to replace that 5,000 or 6,000 megawatts of energy. How were you going to do it? Maybe they weren’t going to do it. But, Speaker, you had to do it. Clearly, that 6,000 megawatts of energy had to be replaced.", "One example that I gave earlier, in my two-minuter—one small example—was that of the five coal-generating facilities in the province of Ontario, two were in my riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan. Our government made the decision to keep both of those plants open. We converted both of those plants to burn biomass, and we converted them at a cost of about $200 million. There are great benefits for the community of Atikokan, and there are great benefits for the community of Thunder Bay, and we’ve created a new industry in Ontario, the pellet manufacturing industry, that is creating more jobs. We’ve also created a long-term energy security situation for northwestern Ontario by keeping those two plants available—$200 million.", "They were two of the smallest plants.

I would like to know what that number is.", "Then, when we talk about the baseline price in 2003 and where we are today, perhaps they can tell me, really, how they would have mitigated that cost and how much of that cost they would not have had to assume if they had the honour and the privilege of being in government.", "Of course, they would have had to do it. We needed the energy. A lot of that cost drive, the cap, had to be there if you want it on your rate base, and the replacement of the coal policy had to be there as well. Those are two points.", "You heard my colleague, the member from Vaughan speak a little bit earlier when he had his two-minuter. We were talking about the state of the energy system when we formed government in 2003. We remember it very, very well. It is not an exaggeration or hyperbolic to say that the system was not in good shape; that the system needed significant investment; and that when we were elected in 2003, we talked very clearly of having an infrastructure deficit and part of that infrastructure deficit was the transmission infrastructure in the province of Ontario. We knew that. I think all three parties represented in the Legislature today will acknowledge that.", "The costs that we invested in the transmission infrastructure in the province of Ontario are significant. I can’t quantify how many billions it was, but the question, again, back to the opposition benches, who are spending a lot of time talking about costs today—I think it’s fair of me to ask them about the artificial cap, coal replacement and what you would have done about the state of the transmission infrastructure in the province of Ontario should you have formed government.

The east-west tie line is a line that exists somewhere between Wawa, Ontario, which is about six hours east of Thunder Bay, and Thunder Bay—about 300-odd kilometres of transmission line. We’ve committed to upgrading that line and basically doubling its capacity so that electricity will be able to be both imported from east to west and exported ,if necessary, from west to east. The cost with just that one transmission project is estimated to be somewhere in the $500-million to $600-million range. I’m not even sure how much it is, but that is part of the massive investments that we made in the transmission infrastructure.", "I give it back to the opposition members, again, to ask me: When you want to talk about two and a half times the price from when we came in, I would ask you to tell me how you would have managed to carry on and take in some of those costs. Perhaps it would have been the same policy they had when it came to coal conversion or the artificial cap. Maybe it would have just been transferred to the tax base. I’m not sure, Speaker. I don’t know what their approach would be.", "The opposition members will also have you believe that green energy has been or is a significant cost component about the increase in the price structure of Ontario hydro. That’s simply not the case. It is simply not the case. In terms of the total percentage increase on your hydro bill, whatever that may be, a very small portion of that is related to green energy.", "And Speaker, they will only talk to you, when they talk about green energy, about wind and solar. They won’t talk about hydraulic. Up near Kapuskasing, in northern Ontario, we constructed a 450-megawatt hydraulic generating facility. I’m very familiar with it because a lot of the tradespeople out of the locals in Thunder Bay have spent two, three or four years working on that particular project: 450 megawatts of clean, green—that’s also green—green energy. Beck III here in Niagara Falls—how many megs is Beck? I think it was somewhere near 600 or 800 or 1,000 more megs.", "When we talk about green energy, they only want to talk about wind and solar. I’ve just rhymed off about 1,500 megawatts of new energy generation that is green, that is hydraulic, that is part of that total energy mix, but they won’t talk about that. That goes back into the PC speaker who asked about how you were going to replace the 5,000 megawatts of energy that used to be produced by coal, that no longer is produced by coal, that you committed to do as well. I would expect that at some point they will have an answer for that.", "We’ve been in government now for 12, going on 13, years. You could throw into this mix about where the costs came from—inflation. What else is lower—in the city of Thunder Bay, I know that their energy and water rates have gone up by about 80% in the same amount of time—about 80% over the same period of time since we came into government in 2003. They’re paying more for water; they’re paying more for sewer. All energy infrastructure, of course, was going to have gone up in that period of time.", "Speaker, the point is that there are some very significant pieces here that were unavoidable, and I think the opposition parties are aware of that. Hopefully, they’ll have an opportunity to make some comments on it.", "I have just about a minute and a half remaining here. I want to close by saying that there are several significant programs out there on energy relief for people: the Northern Ontario Energy Credit, there’s the Ontario Energy and Property Tax Credit, there’s a seniors’ property tax grant, and I think the Minister of Energy has very recently just brought in a new program that is going to provide significant relief for low-income folks in the province of Ontario.", "Finally, I think it’s important to underline—and the Minister of Government Services spoke about this a little bit earlier when he was talking about peak rates and off-peak rates. We responded, I think, fairly and quickly to recommendations from the Auditor General, who in fact didn’t think that the gap was wide enough and thought that the on-peak rates should be higher if we could be then more successful in encouraging people to shift their use to off-peak. Eight-point-something cents, I believe, is the off-peak rate. It’s available 24 hours a day Saturday and Sunday and from 7 p.m. on weekdays until 7 a.m. in the morning.", "We know not everybody can shift their load; we completely understand that. That’s why there are a variety of other programs in place to assist. But, Speaker, it’s important to know that if you shift your use, not only are you benefitting yourself, not only are you benefitting your bill as it arrives at your home, but you’re also making it unnecessary for us to fire up peaking plants that are necessary when we reach those peak demand times for energy in the province of Ontario.", "Speaker, thank you for your time." ],

That would have taken coke oven batteries, taken the power and put it into our central boiler shop, which would have created lots of megawatts of power to actually power the city of Hamilton. Dofasco’s coke ovens, Stelco’s ovens, Algoma’s coke ovens—up where he lives, near Algoma, that would have done that, but nobody looked at cogeneration. That’s how we would have done it in the NDP. But you didn’t look at that.", "Secondly—and Speaker, I really get amazed. Let’s talk about the Samsung deal that they signed with Korea. Guess what?

It had been run up to some $20.8 billion. That was the stranded debt. If you want to see where it’s documented, you could find out in the 2010 Auditor General’s report. I think it’s on page 26 or 28 of that particular document. The Auditor General notes that, initially—referring to the last few years of the Conservative reign of error—not much effort had been made to pay it down, but that once our government was elected, the stranded debt began to gradually move down. As Liberals, we believe in dealing with debt the old-fashioned way: We pay it. Now that stranded debt line is about to go off of people’s electricity bills.

They have created chaos. They have created hard feelings in rural Ontario. They have caused churches to break up over it. They’ve caused problems at schools because kids get fighting about it. Yet they persist in pursuing this terrible energy plan.", "The thing about it is that these things are not efficient. They only run 30% of the time—and 30%, certainly, is a very high mark.

It’s not a particularly gripping title. It really doesn’t tell us what’s in this legislation. In fact, the Minister of the Environment made a very brief speech about this and really didn’t tell us about anything that’s in it. I don’t know whether the parliamentary assistant explained what’s in this legislation either. So here we have a title that’s kind of repetitive: It’s a statute; it’s an act; it’s a bill; it’s a law. I’m not sure, if you pull out a dictionary, if a lot of people understand the difference in meaning between a statute and a law and a bill and an act. It is unfortunate that it has been written this way. This probably isn’t the reason, but I haven’t had any phone calls about this bill; I haven’t had any emails.", "I knew I was going to be speaking to this today, so I googled the legislation on the weekend—there’s nothing there. The bill is there. Hansard is there. There’s a list of the various acts that it amends, but there are no comments from the public; there has been nothing in the media. I’m not sure if this government sent out any news releases about this legislation. Again, I just really ask the question: Where is the citizen participation? Where’s the involvement of people in this province with respect to what we’re told could be enshrining in law some very significant changes, changes that maybe have been going on for years under the table—and finally decided to make them legal?", "So, Speaker, we have a bill before us: It’s an act to amend several statutes, to change some regulations and to deal with long-term energy planning. In a very brief statement in the House—I mean the minister had an hour to talk about this—he talked about increasing competition, it’s still a little unclear how that’s going to occur, and to enhance ratepayer value; that’s very important, given the tremendous increases in the price of electricity to ratepayers.", "Now, he talked about empowering the Independent Electricity System Operator, the IESO. Just a bit of a fact check on that, my research—the research of my party—indicates that this will not further empower the Independent Electricity System Operator. In contrast, it will do exactly the opposite. It will remove much of the independence of the IESO—far from empowering this particular body. I guess we take the minister at his word—empower IESO to competitively procure transmission projects.", "Speaker, I have a transmission project in my riding down in Haldimand–Norfolk. Electric power towers march across Haldimand county, coming out of Niagara. They run from the Allanburg transformer station, continue west across the county; then they stop. The lines go down into the ground; they’re anchored in the ground at the south end of Caledonia.", "This project was sabotaged nine years ago. I vividly recall seeing the Mohawk warrior’s flag flying on top of the tower. This would be 300 feet up in the air, right where that tower meets the main street of Caledonia, Argyle Street, just a few hundred yards from the intersection with the main provincial highway, Highway 6, coming down south from Hamilton. Very clearly, Hydro One workers were not on those towers. Very clearly, Mohawk warriors were on the towers. That was nine and a half years ago. There are no wires. The towers march across. Regrettably, a number of them have been destroyed. They have been used as lookout towers by militants over the years of chaos and mayhem in the Caledonia area.", "So what you see when you enter the main entrance of Caledonia, when you drive into town, there’s a nice green sign, I think it has a picture of the bridge, saying: “Welcome to Caledonia.” You see these gigantic pulleys up on the towers that were meant to pull the wires up to continue the link, essentially, not only to Allanburg transformer station in Niagara, that link with Niagara Falls in New York state through Allanburg, to the Caledonia transfer station which, regrettably, was torched—that was a $1-million damage done by militants—and to continue on to the gigantic Middleport transfer station, just north of Six Nations, just north of the Grand River.", "It’s a 76-kilometre line, again, to ensure the transfer of electrons back and forth between the United States and Canada. Hydro One has been unable or unwilling for well over nine years now to complete the last five kilometres or so of this power line. You can see it when you’re on Highway 6. I think I count about 14 or 20 different power towers partly disassembled with no wires. They were famously used to blockade the main street of Caledonia. They were famously used to be thrown off an overpass onto the provincial highway down below, obviously not the original intent of this transmission corridor. No electricity goes through here to the Middleport transformer station.", "There has been some media on this. Very recently, Paul Bliss, with CTV, reported something we’ve known locally, and I have certainly raised this a number of times in the Ontario Legislature. Again, the recent news from CTV: “Since 2007, Hydro One has had permission from the provincial government to bill taxpayers for its interest payments” on this $100-million project.", "I think the original cost was projected at $116 million; I know that Hydro One did their due diligence. Years ago, I attended meetings where they mapped out where the new towers would be going on an existing corridor. That corridor has been there for many, many years. It was simply replacing antiquated towers. For $100 million in capital cost to build this power line, taxpayers have payed nearly $50 million to date in interest alone for a power line that has never transmitted any electricity, certainly in the last nine and a half years.", "Much of this legislation is directed toward issues of transmission: “The powerline was designed to bring 800 megawatts worth of electricity into southern Ontario. This is equivalent to the amount of power that Ontario gets from one of the nuclear reactors at the Darlington Nuclear Station.” Again, this is according to Paul Bliss with CTV.", "The provincial government indicated that it’s okay because Ontario doesn’t need the electricity right now. We do know that 300,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in recent years. The province made reference to the recession slowing down manufacturing, obviously reducing the demand for power.", "I have a quotation from Hydro One. They were obviously asked, “How come you built this gigantic transmission corridor out of New York state and there has been no electricity?” I quote: We “respected the request by the community to stop work”—I represent that community, Speaker. “However, they remain hopeful that when outstanding issues are resolved”—they’ve been outstanding for nine and a half years—“we can proceed and complete construction of the line.”", "Construction of that line was shut down in Caledonia, in Haldimand county, and in spite of what Hydro One says, the community did not request that Hydro One stop work; far from it. The community has had to put up for nine years now with a wireless, incomplete power transmission corridor scarring the south entrance of town. It’s adjacent to the still-occupied subdivision of Douglas Creek Estates.", "Certainly, there are so many Liberal scandals locally that we talk about over the last 13 years. I consider this the mother of all scandals. One measure: There have now been four books written about the Six Nations/Caledonia scandal. I would suggest, if members here haven’t read any of those four books, that they please do so to get a better picture in your minds with respect to the chaos that has continued down there, south of Hamilton.", "I just wanted to comment briefly on the sale of Hydro One. There’s obviously short-term gain—we see the money coming in from the IPO—but it’s coupled, regrettably, with long-term pain. There is some hope locally. Perhaps the new ownership of Hydro One would have the wherewithal to get an injunction to complete this Caledonia transmission corridor.", "This month, as you would know, Speaker, brought another unaffordable electricity increase as a result of failed policy, in my view. On average, we’re now paying an additional $53 a year. That’s on top of an additional $68 a year last spring.", "This month saw the provincial government’s IPO as well, the initial public offering of 15% of Hydro One. The shares were put on the market at $20.50. Also this month, Ontario’s FAO, the Financial Accountability Officer, released a report confirming something Ontario’s opposition has been saying all along: The Hydro One fire sale is a bad deal. It’s a bad deal certainly for electricity users.", "Patrick Brown, the opposition leader, explained during question period: “It makes no sense to sell an asset that will only net $1.4 billion while you lose an asset that brings in $700 million each and every year.” There was a poll conducted by the Ontario Energy Association, and 80% of residents in Ontario believe the fire sale will raise their hydro bills. You combine increasing hydro bills with so many tax increases, tax increases oftentimes related to what’s going on with electricity in the province of Ontario, and we get the calls in our offices.", "I feel we’ve been doing just about everything we can to try to stop this sell-off. It’s brought up almost on a daily basis. Perhaps the government can reconsider. The 15% is already out the door, but I remain hopeful.", "In the 2015 budget, Ontario announced that intention to sell 60%. In 2015-16, the 15%, as I’ve indicated, would be put on the market, and the balance in subsequent years. By selling 15% of Hydro One, Ontario’s net debt would initially be reduced between $2.4 billion and $3.9 billion. However, in his report, our Financial Accountability Officer warns that net debt would eventually increase as a result of this partial sale, as the costs of forgone revenues from Hydro One begin to exceed the initial benefit.", "As we know, Hydro One is wholly owned at present by the province of Ontario. It’s an electricity transmission and distribution company. They’re not looking after the nuclear generation. In 2014, the company operated 97% of Ontario’s transmission capacity, with the largest distribution system in Ontario, again, covering something like 75% of the province.", "As sole owner up to the present time, the province currently has claim to all of the net income of Hydro One: approximately $750 million last year. Following this 15% sale, the province would have claim, obviously, to only 85% of this net income. The FAO estimates that the sale of 15% of Hydro One would result in a reduction of approximately $50 million a year, and each additional sale would increase this amount of forgone income.", "The FAO—this is the Financial Accountability Officer—does recognize that there could be potential for improvement with respect to Hydro One’s net income as a result of changes and as a result of the influence of new owners. The fact remains that Hydro One is one of the worst-performing electricity distributors in North America, and they spend an awful lot of money to try to maintain that dubious track record. Even among electricity distributors in Ontario, Hydro One, according to the National Post, “performed so poorly that it was considered an outlier,” along with Toronto Hydro.", "This morning in question period it was raised again. The new CEO makes something like $4 million a year. On average, when you look at other employees of Hydro One, they come in at about 10% above comparable wage rates elsewhere.", "So, again, locally, there is hope that new owners may see the way clear. They may have the wherewithal to complete this Niagara transmission corridor through Caledonia, shut down by protesters for now well over nine years, and perhaps it’s contained within Bill 135, where more power will be transferred to the minister to help complete this Caledonia transmission project.", "I’ve got a bridge in the area—two bridges, actually. I’ve raised this before, as with our transmission corridor. It’s been well over a year now that the Cayuga bridge has been shut down. The bridge was originally built in 1927. We clearly needed a new bridge. It’s on a provincial highway. It was a provincial project—a provincial bridge, not something that can be blamed on the local county or blamed on the federal government. But, again, a victim, as with the transmission corridor, of being shut down by intimidation by militants.", "We’ve got another provincial project, 13 years overdue: the Caledonia bridge. Again, it was built in the 1920s. I use it all the time. Haldimand county has now realized that because of the dysfunction that they have observed in the McGuinty-Wynne government—they have asked this government—it’s not very often that you will see a municipality ask a province to not put money into infrastructure. They have cautioned this government: “Don’t start construction on the Caledonia bridge. You’re not going to get anywhere,” having seen what has happened to the Cayuga bridge, having seen what has happened to this Niagara-Caledonia electrical transmission corridor. Again, is Bill 135 here to help? We shall see.", "Just to wrap up, I will remind people that on May 1 of this year, the on-peak price of electricity climbed from 14 cents a kilowatt hour to 16 cents. That’s a 14% increase. And it will be double the new off-peak price of eight cents a kilowatt hour. We’ve already got some of the highest electricity rates in North America. We saw the increase last spring—no, I mentioned last spring, on May 1. We saw a recent increase on November 1. Again, just this month, another electricity price hike: 8.7% for on-peak rates. November 1 saw another $53 added to the average bill. Couple that with the May increase I just mentioned, which, at that time, came in as a $68 price hike. There’s no way people in my area can afford to heat their homes with electricity, given what is going on in the province of Ontario." ],

It’s written by George Vegh. This is what he says about Bill 135: “The net result of Bill 135 is therefore to ensure that the main energy institutions—the IESO and the OEB—are focused almost exclusively on implementing government plans and directives.

But if we do sell it, perhaps it’s a fire sale.” Somehow or other, I can’t square that circle.", "The fact of the matter is that Hydro One does need some private sector discipline infused in it, and that’s exactly what the province has done while being able to take some value from it, maintain complete control over the corporation, and devote that money towards something that we very desperately need, which is expanded infrastructure.", "I come from Peel region. In the morning, when we get on those trains, from the very first one that leaves around 6:30 in the morning until the very last one that leaves at 8:30, those trains are full. There is no question that we need that infrastructure money to be able to expand public transportation in Peel region. We need that infrastructure money to be able to expand public infrastructure all through the 905 belt and everywhere in Ontario. Those are some of the things that the member made an assertion around that I think really need to be explored.", "If the member says Hydro One is among the worst-performing electricity distributors, then how can he be against bringing some private sector discipline into that company and also rewarding its decision-makers with performance-based incentives? If they don’t hit the target, they don’t make the money.

They’ve pleaded with a variety of ministers—the energy minister has changed in recent years; the Minister of the Environment has changed in recent years.

But it’s really interesting to hear that the government does a lot of retrospective talk, because they don’t really want to focus on the current situation that exists in this province right now as it relates to the energy sector. Whenever this government does talk about energy, it raises enormous levels of concern. I know that my colleagues here share my concerns as well.", "Right now, in the province of Ontario, this is a government that has brought in the largest single hydro increase in Ontario’s history, Mr. Speaker. That’s why they’re so focused on the pasts of former governments.", "As it stands right now, 185 municipalities—duly elected—have passed resolutions and have raised their concerns about the sell-off of Hydro One in the province of Ontario. This government has not listened to that.", "This government’s very own Minister of Energy actually stood in this House and absolutely spoke out against the sell-off of Hydro One and the privatization of Hydro One—when he was mayor of Ottawa, and then when he came back as well.", "This is a long-standing issue of who operates the energy system, who runs the energy system, and who’s benefiting now from the sell-off of Hydro One as well. Despite this and despite our continuing chance every single day to ask questions about the sell-off of Hydro One and around any future plans to sell off our province’s publicly owned assets, this government refuses to be transparent.", "This piece of legislation is very important, Mr. Speaker. It does not improve transparency; it does not improve accountability. In fact, I will argue that it does exactly the opposite.", "You can’t blame the people of this province for having some serious trust issues with this government. There is a long, outstanding and growing list of trust issues around any number of issues, from eHealth to Ornge to gas plants.", "I keep all of the Auditor General’s reports in my desk because they are good resources to have. They highlight the incompetencies around contractual agreements, around delivering public services. Quite honestly, she has done a great job. I depend heavily on the Auditor General in this province.", "The interesting piece, though, as I highlighted earlier from George Vegh’s piece—people just need to be very clear about what’s happening with this piece of legislation. It was introduced on October 28 and it was tabled. Bill 135, if enacted, effectively removes the independent electricity planning and procurement authority from the IESO and transmission approval from the OEB. Both of these types of authority will be transferred to the Minister of Energy. The minister will produce long-term energy plans that would be binding on the Ontario Energy Board and the IESO, both of whom must issue implementation plans designed to achieve the objectives of the government’s plan. This is really a centralization, if you will, of power in the Minister of Energy’s office. This runs counter, Mr. Speaker, to the language that we heard from the Premier and from members of the government, who promised openness. They promised transparency. Quite honestly, we’re not going to see any of that. This does not strengthen those concepts at all.", "We also heard a lot about the activist centre, around inclusion; whereas with this piece of legislation, there’s the possibility of consultation but everything still rests solely in the centre of power, which is in the Minister of Energy’s office. When all of that power is there and there are all these long-standing issues as they relate to the policies around energy and the implementation of those energy plans, and the politicization of the energy portfolio, you can’t blame the people in this province for having some very legitimate concerns about this piece of legislation.", "The mantra of this government should be: “We will consult. We may consult. But we probably won’t listen.” That has been the record of this government.", "I have this picture of the Minister of Energy sort of like a Mike Myers character, like Dr. Evil: “We may pay attention, but we probably won’t.”", "I think that when you have the centralization of power on such an important and key ministry—energy policy holds everything together. There are some significant conservation concerns going forward. Energy ties the economy together, and there’s obviously a significant economic impact. When energy policy is done right, it draws investment to those jurisdictions. I think I can highlight Quebec and Manitoba, which are doing a much, much better job on their energy portfolios than the province of Ontario.", "So when I do hear the government talk about the long-term energy plan, I get concerned—as Ontarians get concerned—because this is a tangible issue that they see every single day. They might not understand the $1 billion in the eHealth scandal. They might not understand the $1 billion in Ornge or the gas plants, but they do get that bill every single month. They see those costs going up, and they have good questions.", "Even the Financial Accountability Officer asked some good questions for the province. I was so pleased to see this independent officer of the Legislature come out with his report, An Assessment of the Financial Impact of the Partial Sale of Hydro One. Of course, there were some bumps along the road, you might say, because there was apparently a leak from one of the ministries—we’re not quite sure where.", "The Financial Accountability Officer on the sale of Hydro One is very clear in his essential points. On page 1, it says, “In years following the sale of 60% of Hydro One, the province’s budget balance would be worse than it would have been without the sale.” The second most important point: He says, “The province’s net debt would initially be reduced, but will eventually be higher than it would have been without the sale.”", "I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the balance point is pretty much around the next election, and then the debt starts to accrue again. This is a perfect example of an energy policy decision that is essentially burning the furniture to heat the house. At the end of it, if you heard the member from Nickel Belt talk about the energy concerns in Algoma, where there are great inconsistencies in the level of energy and the level of costs and the consistency of actually getting energy—these are long-standing issues for northern Ontarians. After she finished her debate, the northern members had a conversation about, “What size is your generator?” Because this is the reality for the people in northern Ontario: The energy system is so inconsistent—it’s as broken as it can be, and it’s frayed and fractured—and now with the sell-off of Hydro One, it’s like a double-down on bad energy policy.", "With this act, you have all that power now centralized in the Minister of Energy’s office. I hope I planted that Mike Myers picture for you and I hope that it stays with you, because that’s sort of how I envision decisions being made. The politicization of the energy portfolio—this is a government doubling down on that.", "To return to the Financial Accountability Officer, who raised some good questions on the sale of Hydro One—this is on page 12. He says, “There is much uncertainty around how the debt retirement charge (DRC) would be affected by the partial sale. The DRC is significant revenue for the province and a cost for consumers of electricity.” So the question: “Does the province expect the partial sale of Hydro One to affect the date that the debt retirement charge would be eliminated?” There is no answer on this. With the passing of this piece of legislation, when it does happen, we’ll just have to keep asking the minister. We have seen a lack of clarity around the answers, and we’ve seen a resistance—even when you FOI information, you get a lot of information that’s been completely redacted. Those black, redacted pieces are essentially becoming very significant for us as opposition members, who I feel genuinely have a responsibility to come to this House and to ask the questions so that we can take that information back to our constituents.", "I know from the back benches of both sides that people have serious concerns around the rising cost of hydro. When you have seniors literally coming into your office—it’s been very fortunate because it’s been so mild, and I’ll sort of tie that back into climate change in a minute. But last November, we had seniors in our office asking for assistance because they already couldn’t afford their electricity rates.", "The other question the Financial Accountability Officer raised as it relates to the sell-off of Hydro One: “The single most important unknown in the proposed transaction is the timing of sales after the initial 15% sale in 2015-16. Timing would affect the province’s budget balance....” He does an economic model of how this might look. He does a high and a low. Neither situation is particularly good for the people of this province. From a purely business sense—from a transactional sense—there’s no clear win for the people of this province.", "He goes on to ask: “When does the province plan future sales of Hydro One shares beyond the initial 15% committed in 2015-16?” We’ve made very strong points that it’s not too late to stop this sale. With 15% already out there and Bay Street just totally so excited because they see the money, they see the dollar signs, what we don’t see, of course, is the value for the consumer, for the citizens. I think it’s incredible that this is a government that will oversee the greatest transfer of wealth from the public sector to the private sector in the history of this province.", "You can’t blame us, Mr. Speaker, when we review Bill 135 and how decisions are being made, and ironically, how quickly the sale of Hydro One actually happened. Perhaps that is because there is a banker working right in the Premier’s office. When you look at the infrastructure promises that all of this is predicated upon—in Kitchener-Waterloo, for instance, the Premier and the Minister of Transportation stood on that platform in the last election and said, “All-day, two-way GO in five years.”" ],

That’s how slow they can work. The selling off of Hydro One is how fast they can move when they’re motivated, obviously, for their own purposes. I just wanted to introduce that concept into this debate on Bill 135.", "The questions around effectively removing independent electricity planning and procurement authority from the IESO and the OEB: Where is the motivation? There are some outstanding questions as to why the government moved forward with this. These questions centre around the residual independent authority of the agencies. Why do we have the OEB and the IESO, which ironically were established to use their independent processes and statutory objectives to implement the broad objectives of energy policy as reflected in legislation? Why is this government essentially saying, “Well, you know what? We’re going to change your mandate”?", "As it relates to the act and the language in the act, at least once during the period prescribed by the regulations—and there’s a regulation that changes the environmental assessment piece as well—“the minister shall, subject to the approval of the” LG, “issue a long-term energy plan setting out and balancing the government....", "“The minister shall, before issuing a long-term energy plan under subsection (1), require the IESO to submit a technical report on the adequacy and reliability....”", "So there’s a lot of “shall.” The language should be a red flag for us. We see red flags on this side of the House all the time because the government has given us so much to work with in that regard.", "Effectively, at the end of the day, the Minister of Energy will be writing our long-term energy plan. It’s going to be the minister. That’s where the power is going to be. If this is the case, as I do think it is, what will be the role of the IESO or the OEB? Part of the IESO’s mandate is to take the politics out of it and allow experts to design energy plans for our province. Instead, this government is further politicizing this independent operator and will start issuing directives to them.", "So this is not the openness and the accountability that we were promised. This is actually the exact opposite that the people expected under the headline of “progressive.” It isn’t progressive to just add the political lens, if you will, to the energy file. We’ve seen, actually, how poorly that works out for the people of this province. When the gas plants were still on the radar, the decision, first of all, to move those gas plants and the political implications that moving those gas plants would have on the political fortunes of the Liberals—that did not work out for the people of this province. Furthermore, making that company whole when there was no legal duty to do so should be something that we learn from. Yet, now we have a piece of legislation before us that actually further politicizes this important portfolio.", "So where do we go from here? Our critic has not had a chance to do the hour lead, nor has the PC energy critic. We hope to reach out to our constituents and to reach out to stakeholders to make sure that they fully understand the impact of this piece of legislation.", "But just one last quote by George Vegh: “The net result of Bill 135 is therefore to ensure that the main energy institutions—the IESO and the OEB—are focused almost exclusively on implementing government plans and directives. The government has always been steering the direction of energy policy. It is now rowing as well: it is in direct control of every policy instrument available. From a governance perspective, it could lead one to wonder whether there are any checks and balances left in the system at all.”", "This is a system that needs checks and balances, because we have a track record in this province, under this government, of really doubling down on bad policy. So perhaps this government is tired of listening, because they’ve made the point of enshrining some consultative process, but they’ve made no commitment to listen to the people. We know that they’re very good at conversations. We know that they’re very good at promising the round tables, the stakeholder groups and the focus groups. We’ve seen this over and over again. But, more to the point, what the Hydro One story tells us is that this government will move fast if it suits them, and they create and craft legislation, which usually has a purpose that does not necessarily meet the needs of the people of this province.", "With the highest energy rates in Canada—those energy rates affect the entire economy—and the environment that we are currently in, it’s definitely concerning for us as New Democrats, and I’ve heard similar concerns from the PC Party. But it is more critical than ever that governments have the levers of public ownership to curb global warming and institute real conservation programs. There’s no indication that this piece of legislation will add to that conversation, and, certainly, we have some serious concerns with it going forward." ],

We have recovered—I forget exactly what the metric is—how many hundred thousand jobs, incrementally beyond where we bottomed out after the 2008 recession, with a very, very high percentage of those jobs being full-time jobs.

The member from Mississauga–Streetsville said, “Well, there’s guaranteed consultation with First Nations.” First Nations have this government in court. There was an agreement on Hydro One, but the Chiefs of Ontario—I remember at AMO, he stood up and he said, “You know what? We’re going to have to take this government to court, because even though there was an agreement, there was no consultation.”", "This just goes back to the trust issue. The sale of Hydro One is a breach of trust because it is the largest transfer of wealth from the public to the private sector. That is indisputable. The fact that this government had “broadening ownership”—you talk to anybody in any of our ridings. When you say “broadening ownership,” there was clearly no reference to Hydro One, because that is something that people would have understood. They get those hydro bills, and their electricity costs go up every single month. In fact, the largest one just happened this past November.", "The one concern—and I’m going to get this on the record—is that under section 7 of this act, it says, “For the purposes of clause ... the regulations may require reporting through the use of a prescribed reporting system, including an electronic reporting system administered by a third party....” I see the next scandal right here in a piece of legislation. I think that the concerns I raise today are valid, and I think that this government should do their due diligence and pay attention to some of the commentary, so that the people of this province don’t end up paying the price for a poorly crafted piece of legislation." ],

  "text" : [ "I appreciate this opportunity to speak on this bill in front of us for a little bit of time. In case we’ve lost ourselves here, we’re dealing with Bill 135. There are two parts to the bill. We’re looking at system planning and we’re looking at conservation. I’m going to speak a bit about both of those issues.", "The previous speaker, from Kitchener–Waterloo, mentioned Mike Myers, and I have to get this off my chest, because I think she was painting a picture that in a movie, Mike Myers looked kind of evil or something. But I actually met Mike Myers. I will be short about this: I was on Toronto city council, and my office had contacted him because Scarborough was getting a bad reputation. We contacted him; we wanted to name a street after him. He agreed, so he came to our city council and I was able to give him a street name, Mike Myers Drive.", "It was nice to do that and everything, but there was a bad part to the story. I’ll be very quick about this, Mr. Speaker. The sign was put up, and that night it was stolen. It was taken away. Someone took it away and probably put it in their recreation room downstairs. What happened was that we had to have the works department put a second one up, higher up so it couldn’t be stolen again, and it’s still there right now.", "So I got that off my chest. I just wanted to say that. He’s a very nice man, actually. And this bill is a very nice bill, so that’s how I’m tying it into this bill.", "There are two parts to this bill. Conservation is one part, and the second part is the energy system and long-term energy planning. Let me start with the conservation part and speak for a few minutes about that.", "The conservation part here is quite simple. I’m going to read from some notes here: Large-building energy and water reporting and benchmarking would require large buildings’—50,000 square feet and above—owners to annually report their monthly whole-building energy and water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and other building characteristics.", "The second part of the conservation is water efficiency standards for energy-consuming products and appliances. We would set standards for such appliances as residential and commercial clothes washers, integrated washers and dryers, residential and commercial dishwashers, and commercial icemakers. I’m not going to touch on icemakers, but I’m going to touch on clothes washers and dishwashers.", "I’ve had a couple of homes in my life. The first one that I bought already came with—no dishwasher, but a clothes washer and a clothes dryer. They consume a tremendous amount of energy. Around that time period, in the early 1990s, they started coming out with new appliances that would say “energy efficient,” whether it be a residential clothes washer or a dryer. So eventually I changed out my dryer and my washer, and replaced them with more efficient ones.", "What we’re doing here is we’re putting into place something very positive, to increase and make those things better—and also the icemakers, but as I said earlier, I’m going to speak mostly about dishwashers and drying machines, and clothes washers, as well.", "I moved to another house in 2003, and actually had to buy, for the first time ever, a dishwasher. I never had one before. My wife saw it one day, before she moved in to live with me in the house, and she said, “Lorenzo, you’ve never used your dishwasher.” I said, “I just do it by hand.” It was a brand new dishwasher. She opened it up, and there were the instructions inside the dishwasher. She said, “You should start using the dishwasher.” I said, “Yes, I like doing it by hand, though.” But now we do use the dishwasher, and it doesn’t consume too much energy, because it’s a high-efficiency dishwasher.", "And we do our clothes. We wash them and we dry them and we use energy-efficient products. We had a flood in our basement in 2012, so we had to take out the old ones, and we bought even better ones that are more energy efficient, and we saw our energy bill go further down.", "Again, what we’re doing here is we’re trying to make sure that appliances, whether they be commercial or residential—but I’m speaking mostly about residential ones—are efficient and take less and less electricity off the system, which is a good thing to do.", "I just want to talk about conservation from another point of view, Mr. Speaker. I remember, when I was on Scarborough city council, my colleague—oh, she just stepped out. Another Scarborough member and I were on city council at the same time. The recycling program started to become fashionable in the 1990s. I thought that no one was going to use the blue bins. We distributed them to all the homes in Scarborough, and I was convinced at that time, as I was the chair of the works committee, that people would not use these blue bins. Lo and behold, when they were first put out, people threw all their bottles, all their glass in there. I was surprised. The operators of the recycling machines had to come back on a second and a third day because they had so much stuff to recycle.", "From those bins, we’ve evolved to the point, at least in Toronto, where you can actually get a larger bin, and the larger bin is getting larger and larger. They’ve introduced a very large bin to throw all the glass and other products in. You can throw cardboard in there and other items, as well, but the majority of it is glass, cardboard products and some other plastic products. It’s a big step, because instead of ending up in a garbage dump, this is being diverted. Diversion is very important in saving on landfill sites and on improving our system. When you get the glass and you get the cardboard—I’ve seen how it works in the larger recycling plants—it’s separated and then put into piles and recycled and reused. More and more, you can get all sorts of products that are recycled or made from recycled material, whether it be paper, cardboard—a lot of it is recycled—and even some glass products come from recycled glass.", "Again, when you start something, at first it seems awkward because nobody likes change, but after a while they adjust to it and people actually like it more and more.", "We’re at the point now where one week we put out our recycling bin and the next week we put out our garbage bin.", "Recently, my wife switched out the larger garbage bin to a smaller one. I asked her, “Why did you do that?” She said, “We don’t have much garbage.”", "Everything is diverted, either through the recycling bin—in Toronto, they have what is called a green bin, where you can put all sorts of things: your banana peels, all sorts of vegetables and fruits and other things that can be reused again or turned into compost or turned into fertilizer or something of that nature.", "I think conservation is crucial, and part of it is energy savings. The conservation part requires the large-building owners to report annually their building’s energy and water consumption, their greenhouse gas emissions and other building characteristics. I talked about the clothes washers and the dishwashers and the icemakers, but there’s another part to conservation, and that’s the large-building energy and water reporting and benchmarking. Larger buildings of 50,000 square feet or more—the owners have to report annually on their monthly whole-building energy and water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and other building characteristics. Some would ask, why would the government do that? We’re trying to improve the system. If they start reporting and we find out that they’re using a lot of energy, we can work with them to try to reduce the amount of energy being consumed.", "The term “greenhouse gas” is becoming more and more popular in the news. We hear about it all the time. There’s a climate conference taking place at the end of this month in Paris.", "Again, I express my condolences about what happened over the weekend in Paris. Let’s hope that this becomes less and less frequent.", "There’s going to be a climate change conference. I know that some of the world leaders really want to go there. The President of the United States is big on climate change and wants to go there to discuss greenhouse gas emissions and other issues as well. I know our Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, wants to go there as well and talk about ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other ways to combat climate change.", "We know it’s true. The Republicans in the United States might not think so, but we can see it on the planet. There are islands in various parts of the world that 20 years from now will be under water, in the Pacific Ocean or in the Indian Ocean. We’re doing our part to try to conserve and preserve what we have right now.", "Another thing I want to mention before I forget, with the conservation part and to conserve energy, is that I remember when those energy-efficient light bulbs came out. A lot of people were kind of, “I don’t know if I want to buy an energy-efficient light bulb,” especially in the Christmas lights. They thought, “No, no, I want the old kind of Christmas lights.” But lo and behold, people are buying them now. I go to Rona or Home Depot or other big-box warehouse stores that sell these products, as well as smaller hardware stores, and you can get nice Christmas lights—coloured lights—that are energy-efficient and they look just as good as the old ones that our parents used to put up outside the house when we were kids.", "I can see them. They’re going up now, already, even though Christmas is more than a month away. People are already lighting up their houses, and it’s very, very low—you’re saving a lot of money because you’re not spending a lot on electricity, because we created these light bulbs that are extremely efficient. I think we even have them here in the Legislature. It’s become normal. At first, people don’t feel great about change, but later on, they get used to it and they’re actually conserving more and more energy. Some of these light bulbs last seven years. That’s a long time compared to the old light bulbs that you have to change every two years or every three years. Seven years is a long time.", "They have become the norm. You go into the lighting section of a store like Rona and you want to get light bulbs. Any type you want to get, for the most part, are energy efficient, and, again, the bill goes down and less and less money is spent towards energy. It’s good for the environment and it’s good for the consumers because they save money as well.", "These things take time to change. People are uncomfortable with change, for the most part, but then, eventually, they get used to it. Like I said, with the recycling program: People are recycling and we’re diverting more and more stuff away from the landfill. It’s being used or recycled, and it’s a good thing for the consumer and it’s a good thing for the government, and it’s a good thing for the planet on a larger scale.", "I also wanted to speak for a few minutes about system planning. Again, I’m going to have to read straight from here. The legislation that is in front of us today would enshrine the long-term energy planning process that developed the 2010 and 2013 long-term energy plans to ensure that future long-term energy plans are developed consistent with the principles of cost-effectiveness, reliability, clean energy, community and aboriginal engagement. So we’re looking at this on a long-term basis for planning in the future. We want to make sure that energy plans in the future are consistent and are cost-effective, reliable and are clean energy, and involve communities and even aboriginal engagement, so we’re not going to do it on our own. We want to be able to consult with other groups, other companies that are out there, even the aboriginal community, to make sure that we have system planning in place that helps to create better and more efficient clean energy.", "Again, I think in the future more and more groups will want to work with the government. I think the city of Toronto wanted this to happen as well, so it becomes Ontario-wide. We’ll have cost-effective, reliable clean energy, and it will be done with engagement of the community.", "You look at the idea of planning for the future. I think about—in the future, for example—the thermostats in people’s homes that have evolved over time. We’ve got new ones coming out now that are basically smart thermostats. When you’re at home, it will heat or cool the house in the wintertime or the summertime, but when you’re not there, the furnace doesn’t have to run all day long. For example, for air conditioners: The air conditioner can actually shut off during the day and turn on just to keep the temperature a certain way so that when you get home, it’s still cool enough. You don’t waste energy on thermostats that run all day; they’re just based on the information they get from the thermostat. It’s the same with better furnaces. I’ve gone through a series of furnaces in my lifetime, and they’re getting more and more efficient. These kinds of things—the thermostats, better furnaces and better air conditioners—all help to save on the electricity bill.", "We, as a government, have done a lot of things regarding energy in general, to try to improve energy over the years. We’ve put smart meters into homes. I don’t wake up at 3 in the morning to do my laundry, but I’ll do my laundry on the weekend or after 7 or 8 p.m. at night. It saves on the bill.", "It’s the same with light bulbs. We don’t need to keep them all on all the time. There are ways that light bulbs could be shut off, whether it be by a sensor that goes in the front—if someone is walking in front of it, the sensor comes on. It turns on and then shuts off again.", "I’ve recently been looking into getting a better thermostat. The person who checks the furnace every year said to me, “You’ve got to put one of these into the house because they actually save so much money.”", "This summer we didn’t have the hottest summer in the world, but still it was hot enough that we had to have our air conditioners on once in a while. They would shut off. It doesn’t have to be cold all day long in the house. It would shut off at certain times and it would come back on when it would get hot. We should have a system by now—we’re into the 21st century—where the house should have already equipped inside of it a thermostat that’s able to recognize the temperature in the house and be able to function accordingly.", "It’s the same with better furnaces. My parents’ furnaces would consume a lot of energy. In fact, I remember that in my riding there were some houses that had very old furnaces. You could still see on the side of the house a chute where the truck would come by to put coal into the house where the furnace was located. The house would operate on coal. We all know coal is dirty. We’ve shut down the coal plants in Ontario—all the coal plants. I don’t think there was a single smog day in Toronto, whereas in the past there used to be smog days. Seniors were told to stay inside. People who had asthma or other breathing conditions were told to stay inside because the smog was so bad. I remember seeing photographs on television of this yellow haze in the summertime above Toronto, and other parts of Ontario as well, which was caused by the coal plants that were burning.", "We’ve gone from that to much more cleaner energy just in my lifetime. From the coal furnaces, we’ve gone now to very smart furnaces. Most of them run on natural gas and they shut off when they’re not needed to be used.", "I wish I had more time to speak; it’s coming down really fast. But I wanted to say one thing: I actually got to see ovens that burned wood. So there would be slots that you’d pull out, you would put wood in there, and, when they would turn on, they would heat up the oven, and you’d be able to use the oven that way.", "We’ve come a long way. I think this bill is just improving on that and trying to get us to have better and better programs in place.", "My time is up. I wish I could speak some more. Thank you for giving me this opportunity, Mr. Speaker." ],

I built my home, I guess, in the early 1980s. When you build your own house, you continue to build. I set up everything for solar, actually—the right angles. My houses faces southeast. However, as everybody knows, the technology is not there yet for solar. I’ve been waiting for well over 30 years. Some time it will come. But the member made mention of using wood. I don’t have access to natural gas. We have gas wells on our farm. It’s wet gas. We don’t run it up to the house. I was encouraged, when I was building my house, by the Ontario government to “Live Better Electrically.” I had no choice: I put in a forced-air electric system.", "We’ve had two very cold winters. I don’t use that electric system. I have to heat with wood. My wife and I go through 20 cords of wood a winter. I’m desperately trying to get wood in right now. There’s no frost on the ground. It’s a little difficult. I really find it passing strange that the way I’m heating my house now on our farm, I’ve had to go back 100 years. I’m fine with heating with wood. It’s not complex like our electrical system. There’s no delivery charge other than me walking down the hill or driving my pickup truck down and firing up the chainsaw. It’s real simple. How did we make our heating system so complex?" ],

But that’s a whole other thing.", "Listen, I just want to get to this bill and, yet again, remind people what we’re debating here. We’ve got a bill where the government is saying, “Here, trust us. We’re Liberals. We’re good on energy policy. You know that we’ll always do the right thing when it comes to the people and electricity and the hydro file. What we would like to do is take away any responsibilities that the Ontario Energy Board has, or the IESO has, when it comes to developing an energy plan, when it comes to planning how your electricity system is going to work. Don’t worry; we’re going to give that responsibility to the minister.” Then the minister is going to be able to decide what the plan is going to look like, what the scope is going to be of any hearings that happen, who the people are who are going to be the ones who will be consulted, where they are going to go. And once the report comes back, “Should I or should I not take, as the minister”—says the Liberal member—“the recommendations that came out of this particular hearing?”, it will be entirely up to the minister’s office.", "I think we should be wary of Liberals who are trying to sell us anything when it comes to energy planning. We know what happened the last time these guys got involved in the plan. They mucked around with—what did they call it again on the OPG side—the feed-in tariff program, which they’re getting rid of, which worries me. What are they going to replace it with? The feed-in tariff program helped us raise electricity prices in this province through the roof, because we’re paying more for private power than we are for public power. Now these guys are saying, “Put us in charge of planning so we can site transmission lines, we can site various infrastructure and electricity, and we, the government, are going to decide where that is, and you, the public, are not going to have the opportunity to really have your say.” I don’t trust them." ],

He talked a great deal about conservation, and this whole area is extremely important to the residents in my riding of Oak Ridges–Markham. With the location of my riding on the Oak Ridges moraine, people are very concerned about climate change. They know that they’re doing their bit when it comes to conservation, whether it is using those new light bulbs that last much, much longer than the old incandescent lighting systems—they know that they’re doing what they can as individuals, using off-peak for their laundry, for dishwashers and so on.", "I think what they also want to see is that business comes to the table on making some considerable efforts. A couple of the initiatives that are in this Energy Statute Law Amendment Act are going to be very important to my constituents. We know that in the energy and water reporting and benchmarking initiative for large buildings, property owners will be required to track buildings’ energy and water use and their greenhouse gas emissions over time.", "This will allow individuals to track how they’re doing. It only makes sense, in terms of cost, to conserve, to reduce the use of energy.

They should have started this a long time ago and avoided all the scandals like eHealth, Ornge air ambulance, the Presto card, gas plant closures, and that big mistake of signing on to the Green Energy Act, which is solar and wind power, which is hugely expensive. Those were all huge spendings; a wasteful use of taxpayers’ money, and here we are today trying to conserve because we have a shortage of energy. This is a huge intrusion into people’s freedoms and their privacy—Big Brother coming into their homes.", "What we should have done was gone to Quebec and bought hydro from them. They have copious amounts of hydroelectricity. They sell it to the United States already. We have power lines literally coming to the Ottawa River, out of Ottawa, hanging out over the water, ready to be connected to Ontario. We have another set of lines that goes across the province into the state of New York. The lines are there. The power would have been cheap. The solar and the wind power are very, very expensive. We are now in a situation where people literally can’t afford their hydro bills and we have the most expensive power in North America. We’re driving industry and jobs out of the province. We made some big mistakes there.", "What we should have done was carry on with the energy we’re producing. We could have put all the scrubbers and technologies on the plants that we had and perhaps converted them to gas if we needed to. There is even carbon capture technology being used in Saskatchewan, which we could have used here in Ontario. We didn’t need to do all the things that we did that wasted our money and put us in this terrible predicament where we’ve had to sell Hydro One and come up with legislation like this, which is a knee-jerk reaction to bad management." ],

Downtown Toronto homes, the majority of them, have got water meters, so they have to be careful when they consume their water.", "We’re trying to improve that, and we’re working on two fundamental areas: the conservation of energy and long-term energy planning.

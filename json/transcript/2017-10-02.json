This is the beginning of second reading debate.", "As you may know, Mr. Speaker, after first reading this bill went out for public consultation in 10 different communities across Ontario, which is pretty unusual. But given the complexity and the impacts of this bill, which is quite a game-changing bill, I think it was appropriate to go out and listen to people in Thunder Bay, Ottawa, Kingston, Toronto, Kitchener, and Niagara Falls.", "I was in a lot of those public hearings, and it was very compelling to hear people on both sides of the issue. There were some compelling stories about how this change to labour relations laws might affect some employers, small and large. They were really sincere. They weren’t there for ideological reasons. They just said, “Some of these changes may be hard for us to handle.” On the other hand, there were also all kinds of people who came up and said, “I cannot survive on $11.40 an hour.” These were people who sometimes had two or three jobs. These were people who wanted to work, but they could not pay the rent at the end of the month. In fact, many of them got into debt at the end of the month and had to go to a cash advance or borrow money from family and friends. These were people who came before, made deputations—and, as I said, they were trying to put across their concern or their support for this legislation.", "There’s no doubt the changes in this legislation are quite far-reaching in that the Labour Relations Act and the Employment Standards Act haven’t been updated, in some cases, in over 20 years. This update or modernization had to be done. Mr. Speaker, you’ll well know that the workplace in Ontario, in small and large communities, has changed. Most jobs people have that are full-time with benefits, a pension and full hours are a real gift. But what’s happening more and more is that there is more part-time work, temporary work and contract work, where you don’t know if you’re going to get the hours you want, you don’t know whether you’re going to be called in and you don’t know whether or not you’re going to have a paycheque in two or three weeks.", "Again, there are over 1.6 million Ontarians who work hard and get paid minimum wage, or certainly under $15 an hour. Therefore, they’re asking the Legislature—they’re asking, really, their employers, everyone, how we can deal with this income inequality in Ontario, where a lot of people, through their good fortune and hard work, are making a good living. They may belong to a union; they may work for a big company. They, God bless them, are making good money. But there are all kinds of people who find themselves working harder and harder, multiple jobs, and there’s a growing gap between those making more and more money and those who are working hard and, again, are not able to pay the rent. These are not people who want to go to social assistance, as we heard in the deputations across the province; these are people who want to work. What they’ve said loud and clear is that they need an increase in the minimum wage. The present rate we’re increasing minimum wage is just not going to do.", "We had the workplace review, which went on for a couple of years, and they made a lot of recommendations that have been incorporated in this bill. For instance, after five years, the bill calls for at least three weeks of paid vacation every year. That’s a change, an improvement. It also calls for 10 personal emergency leave days, including two paid days, a year. Those are new provisions in Bill 148.", "Employees can turn down a shift without fear of losing their job if they are not given four days’ notice. Employers must pay workers the equivalent of three hours’ wages when a shift is cancelled within 48 hours of a scheduled start time—another thing that employees asked for.", "There’s also a provision here that says “equal pay for equal work.” It’s quite common, in Newmarket or in Clappison’s Corners, where you’ll have a full-time worker working beside a part-time worker. The full-time worker in Clappison’s Corners is making twice as much as the part-time worker at Clappison’s Corners, working side by each on the job. Is it fair that that worker at Clappison’s Corners who is working part-time makes less than the worker right beside them who is employed full-time? One will make 11 bucks an hour; the other person will make 20 or 25 bucks an hour. That’s what happens right now.", "This bill, Bill 148, calls for equal work for equal pay. I know that it’s a revolutionary idea that’s opposed by the critics. They say, “Well, we can’t have this,” and they’re opposed to the other provisions. We heard them. We’ve heard the big banks all across Canada—not all the big banks, but certainly TD. We heard Magna come out and say, “This is going to mean the end of the world as we know it.” Magna: I think that Frank Stronach made $53 million when he was CEO of Magna—a $53-million salary.", "It’s interesting. Magna forgets that when the Ontario taxpayers bailed out the auto industry, Magna was one of the big beneficiaries of the bailout. They were crying for help: “You’ve got to help the auto industry.” The taxpayers of Ontario bailed out the auto industry in 2008 and 2009. That was then. Now, all of a sudden, Magna and some of the big companies say, “Oh, this is going to be impossible.” Well, it’s a bit disappointing. I can see that they would have concerns—and they’re legitimate concerns in some part—but I think they sometimes protest too much.", "I know that the CEO of Loblaws—a great Canadian company. I was really disappointed when I saw Galen Weston Jr. come out and say, “I don’t think we can do this. This is going to cut into our profits.” Multi-million-dollar profits every year—and God bless him. Loblaws employees are good people; it’s a good Canadian store, but it’s disappointing to see Galen Weston Jr. say they can’t do this.", "You know what I think? We’ve got to look at the example of the CEO of Sobeys, another great Canadian company. Their president, Michael Medline—here’s what he said, which is quite refreshing. This is completely opposite to some of the others. The Magna CEO is saying, or the Loblaws CEO, or the Toronto-Dominion Bank, they say, “No, we can’t do it.” The CEO of Sobeys says:", "“‘We’re trying to have our employees be a competitive advantage even more than they are today, so the idea of financing that off of fewer employees to serve our customers is counterproductive and doesn’t really fit the values I like. So therefore, we’ll be finding savings but it won’t be on the backs of our teammates,’ Medline said in an interview after the company reported earnings.”", "Here’s the example that you would think others would follow, especially these big companies: Find a way of ensuring that your workers are appreciated with a living wage. That’s what we’re talking about here. The wage will go up to $14 from $11.60 in the first year, and then it would go up to $15. Is it challenging for some small employers? Yes, there will be some challenges. That’s why the minister of small business and the Minister of Economic Development have been talking to small businesses, have been talking to different sectors, trying to find ways of helping in the transition and finding ways of helping them get through this, because ultimately, there has to be a change, but sometimes change is difficult. Therefore, we’re looking at ways of helping people transition through this.", "Again, as I said at the beginning, at some of the deputations across the province we heard loud and clear about some of the challenges that the increased minimum wage and the new labour laws that have come in place—greater labour protections. Some of them said, “Don’t bring in those labour law changes now.” The rapidly changing workplace really cries out for more support for workers. I’m sure, if you look around in your own communities, you’ll see that more and more people are working at minimum wage, temporary, as I said, and contract wage. They don’t have a pension; they don’t even know if they’re going to be working a month from now. Many of them work two or three jobs. Again, these are people who want to work; they’re not asking for a handout. They’re just saying, “Give us a fair, living wage.”", "Whether it’s the price of gasoline at the pump or whether it’s the price of milk, the millionaire pays the same for the gasoline fill-up at the pump as does the minimum wage worker. There’s no discount if you’re poor. Therefore, the minimum wage worker pays the same for many products as the person who’s making good money. God bless the millionaires and the people who are making good money; we don’t begrudge them, but what we do is say that we want working people to get a fair wage.", "Interjections." ],

So maybe my Conservative colleagues should start asking working people what they think of the minimum wage—not to ask the bank CEOs, not to ask the Magna CEOs.

She came to me—I remember it very clearly. She said, “Mike, is it okay, because I can’t make ends meet, despite all my jobs”—despite working her whole life—“can I apply to get some food support at the food bank?”", "This is not uncommon in communities across Ontario, where people are working hard. But if you’re working hard and making 11 or 12 bucks an hour, you cannot keep pace with the cost of living because the rent, especially if you live in the GTA—if you’re making 11 bucks an hour and you’re paying 1,000 bucks or 1,200 bucks a month rent, and if you’ve got kids and are paying for their clothes and paying to put food on the table. At the end of each month, these people are saying, “All this work that I do—I need some help. I can’t seem to make ends meet month after month after month.”", "That’s why we heard in the delegations that came—we heard from some small businesses. We heard from the city of Cambridge and the companies that do business with the city of Cambridge, who said that they give everybody a living wage.

I just, for the life of me, can’t believe who they think would be hurt by giving people a couple of more bucks an hour. These are people who want to work. These are people who have families, have to pay rent, have to pay for food, and right now, if you ask them, they are not able to make ends meet. So they’re asking their employers to work with them, to give them better protection on the job, to improve labour conditions and labour protections so they can work safely and have reasonable hours and get equal pay for equal work. On top of that, they’re saying, “Give us an increase to the minimum wage.”", "Then the big Conservative economists come and say, “Well, this going to be the end of the world as we know it, so don’t do it.” But we know for sure—we heard from the $15 and Fairness campaign; we heard from a professor from the University of Waterloo at the deputations—", "Interjection." ],

If they get that $14 an hour, $15 an hour, they’re not going to spend the money offshore. They’re going to spend the money in the local community, buying milk, groceries, shoes. When the local workers get a few more dollars, they’re going to spend them at their local stores, so it helps the local economy. The big Conservative economists, the Fraser Institute and all these right-wing think tanks don’t talk about that. They don’t talk about the money being spent locally by these working people who are going to buy more shoes, perhaps buy more food for their kids, and pay the rent. The Conservatives don’t like this. I’d like to hear their explanation of why they don’t like people who are working hard to get a fair wage.

Hydro rates increased 300% over this last number of years, and that’s what has contributed to people not being able to pay their bills. It’s interesting that, had the NDP not propped up this government when we had a minority here, probably we wouldn’t have the Green Energy Act around today. I think they have to take some responsibility for that.", "Even the Premier said a number of years ago that she favoured a phased-in approach to increasing the minimum wage, and now we are in the position that we are going to increase the minimum wage 30-some per cent on January 1. Nobody is arguing that people don’t need more money; it’s just that the period of time that they’re doing this is going to be difficult on a number of businesses to accept that. We are getting calls from different businesses to say, “We’re going to have an issue hiring students this summer because of the fast increase in the minimum wage.”", "I think it’s too bad this is happening. Businesses are the job creators, in case nobody on the other side of the floor knows that. If you put too much pressure on them, they are going to maybe do some drastic things in order to keep their businesses or they’re going to go out of business, or maybe some more of them are going to move south of the border. If you haven’t considered that, then I wish that you would consider that as we go forward." ],

We listened to them and said, “Okay, we’re going to increase it to $14 and then $15.”", "I know this is hard for the Conservatives to understand, but you can’t just talk to business. You’ve got to also talk to working people. All they say is, “We want to work hard, we want to continue to do what we can, but we’re having a challenge because the minimum wage is too low, because we can’t get enough hours and because we don’t have equal pay for equal work.” These are the things that working people are saying.", "Certainly you’re going to have the right-wing think-tanks oppose this, and some of the big corporations, but on the other hand, in the long run this is about ensuring that people who want to work get a living wage and continue to work. This is not about windmills and all these things the Tories want to talk about; this is about working people. They talk about windmills. We’re talking about hard-working people. Many of them are adults. It’s not just students—working people. They keep talking about windmills. We want to talk about working people in Bill 148." ],

Indeed, I saw a Facebook post from a good acquaintance of mine, a doctor, an orthopedic surgeon in Perth, on the weekend that with the federal tax changes, he’s out of here. He’s leaving this province. He’s leaving this country.

We have a government who is more interested in their electoral fortunes than the good fortunes and the commonwealth of the people of this province. That’s what has been wrong. It was wrong in 2009 with the Green Energy Act, when they killed our manufacturing sector.

So when you see the letters I have from our businesses in North Bay, they agree with that philosophy that it’s just too soon. It’s happening too quickly.", "Rahn Plastics, a long-time company, has been there as long as I can remember, in North Bay. Rahn Plastics, writing to me, “is in favour of many aspects of Bill 148; however, a 32% wage increase is not financially sustainable for all companies. It must be done in a way that won’t devastate or break companies. The goal is to have workers employed, but this drastic increase will cause job losses for sure! This will not only affect minimum wage workers but it will offset a chain reaction for other more senior workers as well.” They go on to say, “Should minimum wage be increased? Absolutely, but it needs to be done in a way that won’t break businesses.”", "The tourism industry association are writing to express their industry’s concerns, including the speed at which many legislative changes are proposed. They tell me that of these businesses in Ontario, approximately 846 businesses and 10,133 jobs are located within my riding of Nipissing. They are saying these members will be significantly impacted if businesses are not given sufficient time to implement changes proposed in Bill 148.", "The North Bay and District Chamber of Commerce—I was proud to be the president back there in 1986—has grown, and continues to grow and be a voice of business. They tell us that there’s no economic impact done by this government, so they’ve done one for us. It talks about: a $23-billion hit to business over the next two years alone; 30,000 jobs at risk for youth under 25; 96,000 employees at risk are expected to be women. They tell us, of course—well, I’ll repeat what the minister said when he said, “Just raise your prices.” He said and the chamber says that this will increase everyday consumer goods and services by $1,300 per household, on average, each and every year.", "This is an email I received from Carolann Paquette:", "“Good morning Vic,", "“I just want to ask you if you can pass a message to” the Premier.", "“Thank her for the hike in minimum wage ... now my boss had to cut back my full-time hours to account for the” upcoming “increase.", "“Now I’m going to get less than I was before.", "“Not a ... good decision.", "“I have children ... now I’m worried even more how ... I’m going to make ends meet.”", "Carolann, we hope to get you some answers.", "Speaker, last month, we saw the Ontario chamber and their partners come out with a report that says there will be 185,000 jobs at risk. There are all kinds of reports that I’m going to refer to now. Nobody is debating the job losses; all they’re fighting over now is how many tens of thousands of people in Ontario are going to lose their jobs. The first who weighed in was the Financial Accountability Officer, our own legislative officer. He says and that group says it’s 50,000 jobs, with job losses concentrated amongst teens and youth. He said, “There is evidence to suggest that the job losses could be larger” than his estimate, as the increase is both “larger and more rapid than past experience, providing businesses with a greater incentive to reduce costs more aggressively.”", "The FAO concludes, “Since minimum wages target low-wage workers, but not necessarily low-income families, raising the minimum wage would be an inefficient policy tool for reducing overall poverty.”", "The Fraser Institute came out with their bulletin “Ontario Enters Uncharted Waters with a $15 Minimum Wage.” They suggest that a rapid increase will have harmful unintended consequences—we pass a threshold. They talk about North Bay, as a matter of fact, as one community that will be particularly hard hit.", "TD Economics published their economic assessment which forecasts “a net reduction in jobs of around 80-90k positions by the end of the decade.”", "They conclude that the “relatively rapid speed of the implementation and”—this is new now—“its timing within the economic cycle are two factors that will likely accentuate the negative hit to Ontario employment.”", "With respect to the timing, they’re saying it coincides with what they call “significantly slower economic growth.” I’ll get back to that in a second.", "They say that we’re “likely to endure a cyclical slowdown in both housing ... and household leverage, economic growth will likely slow sharply in the province.”", "They’re suggesting, “These estimated job impacts could be mitigated by extending the implementation timeline.”", "Speaker, one after another after another has said it’s the timeline. TD talks about the timing, as well. Why do they talk about the timing? And why do you think TD says that we’re going to have significantly slower economic growth?", "Well, it’s interesting; I know that the labour minister announces frequently, including recently, that “The prosperity we’re seeing in the Ontario economy now has to be shared by everybody....” That’s it in a nutshell. That’s the reasoning. That’s their whole rationale.", "But the minister pushes this point. He stood in the Legislature—I’ve said this one before—and announced, “It’s true that the Ontario economy is doing very well ... manufacturing exports are up.” Except that is not accurate, Speaker. A recent headline, “July Trade Deteriorates,” leads the whole story that shows you that Ontario exports fell 22% this summer. StatsCan just last week released their data showing manufacturing sales suffered their largest decline in eight years. But the minister doubled down with, “We’re leading the G7 in economic growth,” and the finance minister piled on with “Ontario is ... number one in North America when it comes to economic growth.” Except neither of those statements are even close to being accurate. Ontario’s growth is not number one. We’re tied for 28th place in North America—there are 27 US states ahead of us.", "So it’s sad that StatsCan is being questioned by the Minister of Labour, Speaker. These are StatsCan figures. It’s Stats Canada who is telling us that we’ve tumbled. But you see, the problem here is that these facts from StatsCan don’t quite align with the government’s narrative and their talking points, so oops. They now realize that their premise of why this is being rushed in has no basis in fact.", "If that wasn’t enough, let me read you just some headlines that complete the picture. These are headlines only that I picked out in the month of September. “Exports Languish: International merchandise exports fell, ... while imports edged higher.” We’re shipping less, getting more—not built in the States—brought in. “Manufacturing sales slipped in a widespread decline across industries.” This is universal across industries, Speaker; this isn’t just one. “Retail sales cool” is another headline. “Ontario ranks 44th”—that’s out of 60—“in labour market rankings.” Here’s another one that’s very strong: “Once-powerful Ontario Now a Fiscal Laggard in Canada.” And another one: “Canadian Incomes Jump, Ontario Residents Hit by Manufacturing Downturn.” And the final one, “Ontario: Fiscal Leader to Fiscal Laggard.”", "Again, the minister’s narrative doesn’t line up with the facts, when they continue to—in fact, in the Globe and Mail today was the same quote about the fact that our economy is doing well and manufacturing exports are up. I couldn’t believe that when I read it.", "I have said this in the Legislature before—recently. I would have hoped that the government would pick up on those points, that you’re going to have to change your talking points and your narrative. It does not any longer line up with the facts, Speaker. That is indeed why we end up with letters from people like TJ, who says, “I’m having another sleepless night again.” It’s “4:31 a.m. in the morning, hear our voice, small business owners, and if you plan to be fair, then be fair to everyone. Please come up with a plan that doesn’t put the entire burden on small business....”" ],

I was at one of the committee hearings in North Bay, and we heard from both sides of the issue. I had a nice long talk with some constituents in my office. Bruno Lepage owns one of the famous poutine stands in Sturgeon Falls—best poutine, best fries in Ontario. He had the same concerns that the government—and the NDP has been pushing for $15 for a long time; we’ve also been saying that, in sectors that can’t buffer that shock, they are going to need some offsets. For years, the Liberal government has been saying, “These guys are off the wall. We don’t need to do that.” And now, when we’re coming close to the election, they’re trying to do this, not to benefit the people who need more money, the people who need an adequate standard of living; what they’re trying to do is, they’re doing this for their own purposes and they’re catching employers by surprise. And employers, many of them, rightfully so, are very worried because there doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to how this government is acting. What employers are demanding and what employers need—and what Bruno Lepage needs—is stability. He needs to know how he’s going to cope with this.", "It’s the same as with the Liberal changes to income tax federally: It’s not that changes are not perhaps warranted; it’s how they do it.

For the economy, I just have a quote from a UFCW rep: “One of the ways that I think that minimum wage will actually help is that people will earn more money. It generates an economic stimulus in your local economy.”", "Secondly, of course, is children. What is more primary in our life than children? This is by a doctor who is a medical officer of health: “We also welcome the proposed increases to minimum wage.

Clearly, Speaker, this was not good enough.", "We heard repeatedly from presenter after presenter that this is going to endanger women; it’s going to force women to have to choose to stay in an abusive relationship because they couldn’t afford to take unpaid leave. If they had used their two paid days of personal emergency leave to deal with a burst pipe or the sickness of a child, then when they were in a crisis situation caused by an incident of domestic violence, they would have to decide: Can they afford to take unpaid leave to deal with the results of that violence? Many of the presenters said no. This is forcing women to have to choose between their job and their safety, and it is unacceptable. There must be designated paid leave.", "I just want to read to you from what was said to the committee by a representative of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers’ Association. She said:", "“As teachers, we see the effects of domestic violence. We see it in our colleagues who are survivors; we see it in children who bring this pain and mental anguish with them to school where it impacts their work and academic achievement; we see it in parents who are survivors. We’ve seen colleagues go through tremendous suffering. As victims not of their own choosing, they experience a whirlwind of emotions: shock, grief, despair, guilt, anxiety, denial, anger, self-doubt, depression, insecurity, disbelief and on and on, often all at once. They are in crisis.", "“The suffering does not end at home either, as it goes to work with them. Sometimes it is a harassing phone call or a threatening text. In one extreme case in Mississauga, an estranged husband followed his wife to school and shot her to death in the school parking lot.”", "Speaker, I had a similar experience in my own community of London when I was chair of the Thames Valley District School Board. We had a grade 6 teacher at one of our schools, Ashley Oaks Public School, who was murdered by her intimate partner. I can tell you, Speaker, it was devastating for many of us in the school board. It brought home how the implications and the impact of domestic violence have a very, very real and profound effect on co-workers and on the entire community.", "Another presentation that was made to the committee cited a report that was done by the Conference Board of Canada. The Conference Board of Canada found in that report, which was called Domestic Violence and the Role of the Employer, that “71% of employers reported experiencing a situation where it was necessary to protect a victim of domestic abuse.” They further noted, “While many workplaces have been proactive in this area, few employers offer training and education.”", "That, Speaker, is why so many deputants came to the committee and said that there needed to be designated paid leave for domestic violence and sexual violence, and there also needed to be training to accompany that leave. There needed to be training to sensitize employers to employees who come forward with a disclosure and need to access that leave, and there needs to be training for co-workers to make them aware of the warning signs that there may be a co-worker who is experiencing domestic violence and sexual violence.", "Certainly, in the bill that we have before us today, the Liberals moved a tiny little step toward addressing the concerns. They created a new category of domestic or sexual violence leave that allows employees to take 10 days of leave or 15 weeks of leave. They further went on to state that under the 10-days-of-leave provisions, if an employee takes any part of a day as leave, the leave will be deemed to be the entire day. Under the 15-weeks clause of the bill, if an employee takes any part of a week as leave, the leave will be deemed to be a full week of leave.", "There’s nothing in the government’s amendments that we are debating today that talks about paid leave. That really is the critical piece.", "There was a letter that went to the Premier on September 27 from OAITH, the Ontario Association of Interval and Transition Houses, the Canadian Labour Congress, and the Ontario Federation of Labour. They emphasize that the government’s amendments fall short of providing the support and job protection that are critical to survivors of domestic violence and sexual violence. They highlight the unintended results of not providing dedicated paid DVSV leave, and that would be survivors not being able to access the leave when they require it because they can’t afford to take the time off work. Paid leave is also important because of the dynamics of power and control in abusive relationships. Research shows that over 90% of DVSV survivors experience financial control. If accessing unpaid leave results in a lower paycheque than the abuser is expecting, there may be serious consequences for the worker—again, an unintended result of not providing a paid leave. They urgently emphasize the need for the government to go where it should have gone in the first place and provide not only designated domestic violence and sexual violence leave, but paid leave.", "That is why, last Thursday, we debated Bill 157, which would do exactly that. It would ensure that every survivor of domestic violence and sexual violence is able to access up to 10 days of paid leave to heal from the trauma and to deal with the abuse and the violence they had experienced.", "That bill calls on the provincial treasury to cover the cost of that paid leave. This makes sense because we know, from studies that were done nationally, that domestic violence has an annual cost of $7.4 billion across the Canadian economy—that is, costs to social services and to the criminal and civil justice systems; costs to employers in productivity decreases and distractedness; and costs for counselling and for the pain and suffering, of course, of the victim.", "We also know that sexual violence has a similar impact on the economy. The cost of sexual violence is $4.8 billion a year across this country. Again, this is in terms of the cost to victims—the medical services, the lost productivity, the pain and suffering; and also the costs to society—the cost of operating a criminal justice system and social services and employer losses.", "We are shouldering an economic burden because of domestic violence and sexual violence. Allowing women who have experienced domestic violence and sexual violence to keep their employment while they are dealing with violence is one of the most important things that we can do to support survivors and enable people who have experienced domestic violence or sexual violence to leave the abusive relationship and move on with their lives. So this would actually reduce the economic costs associated with these forms of violence.", "Oh, my goodness, the time is flying.", "The other aspect of the bill that I wanted to address was around equal pay for equal work. I want to commend the efforts of my colleague the member for Bramalea–Gore–Malton on his bringing forward of an initiative to protect temporary workers: to ensure that temporary workers who are doing the exact same job as the person they are working beside receive the same level of compensation.", "The problem is that the language that the government has insisted on using, which refers to employees who are doing “substantially the same kind of work,” opens up all kinds of loopholes—which are very problematic—for employers to be able to say, “Well, it’s kind of the same, but it’s not substantially the same. Therefore, we’re going to continue to justify a lower rate of pay.”", "This is an issue that was raised very effectively—although not effectively enough, because the Liberals refused to make any changes. This was an issue that was raised by the Ontario Equal Pay Coalition. They talked about the fact that there is current language in the Employment Standards Act that talks about equal pay for equal work. That language has been in place for years. However, that language has not effectively addressed the gender wage gap. It has really done nothing to reduce the gender wage gap, which has remained stalled at 30% for so many years.", "The Equal Pay Coalition talked about the need to change the language from “substantially the same kind of work” to “similar work,” which would really help ensure that temporary workers, that part-time workers, that contract workers were being paid as they should be paid for doing essentially the same work—similar work—to what is being performed by other workers in the workplace.", "This was also an issue that was repeatedly raised with the committee by faculty associations. Again, on September 28, OCUFA, the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations, sent a letter to the Premier reiterating its view that the language “substantially the same” has to be strengthened, has to be tightened, has to be changed to “similar” work if there is truly going to be the protection that workers need, because it simply provides too much scope for employers to continue to justify not providing equal pay for workers in the workplace.", "That’s why my colleague the member for Welland brought forward this amendment during clause-by-clause on Bill 148. You can be sure that we’ll be bringing forward this amendment again after second reading, because it is so important, and we heard from so many people about the need for strengthened language to deal with this issue.", "In the few minutes I have remaining, I wanted to touch on one additional aspect of the bill, and that is around the new exemption that has been made for students who are studying in a program approved by a private career college.", "Currently, in the Employment Standards Act, students who are studying at university or at colleges and are doing a work placement as part of their program are exempt from the Employment Standards Act.", "We know that the government of Ontario has announced that every student in this province will have at least one experiential learning opportunity by the time they complete secondary school, and another experiential learning opportunity while they are studying at post-secondary. There are going to be more and more and more of these work placements occurring throughout this province, and that’s a good thing.", "What’s not a good thing is if students are exploited when they are performing work as part of their program, but they’re performing work for an employer and they’re completely outside any legal protections of the Employment Standards Act.", "I had a bill, Bill 64, the Protecting Interns and Creating a Learning Economy Act, that proposed a legal definition of “work-integrated learning” so that students who were participating in field placements, internships, practicums, or whatever they are called at their post-secondary program, have some legal protection—something to fall back on if the employer is not giving them a break for lunch or a break in the afternoon, or their vacation pay—because there is absolutely nothing in the Employment Standards Act to provide any kind of protection for students who are studying.", "Instead of addressing that absence of protection in the Employment Standards Act, what does the Liberal government do? They expand that absence of protection to include 70,000 more students in this province, who will now be exempt from any kind of protection under the Employment Standards Act.", "Speaker, I want to call on this Liberal government to take the opportunity, while second reading debate on Bill 148 is taking place, to look at this absence, to look at these exemptions and to truly address the issues that were raised during committee." ],

The Ontario Equal Pay Coalition has made it clear that there needs to be a change in term from “substantially the same” to “similar” work to include and encompass more.

I want to elaborate a bit about why those issues are so important. In our post-secondary system, we have for the first time in this province passed the point where the majority of the funding is no longer coming from the government; the majority of the funding for the university sector is coming from students. It’s raised through tuition dollars. We’re almost at that point in the college system. We know that students in Ontario are paying higher tuition than anywhere else in the country, and yet when they go into our post-secondary institutions, they are very likely to be taught by contract faculty, by precarious university instructors who have no job security, who are living basically on below-minimum-wage incomes, who are having to reapply for their jobs every four months—sometimes for 20 years. People came to the committee and talked about having to do this year after year after year. So 50% of undergraduate students in our university sector are being taught by precarious contract faculty who are not being compensated the same as their peers for doing the same work and whose salaries represent about 4% of university budgets.", "That is unacceptable; that is not fair. I think parents have a right to question and students have a right to question where their tuition dollars are going if they’re not going to compensate faculty for teaching their classes." ],

I’m going to be sharing my time with the member for Ancaster–Dundas–Flamborough–Westdale.", "I want to use my time this afternoon to talk about the day that the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs visited my riding of Kitchener Centre. It was July 18. As you know, the committee toured a number of communities this past summer to get feedback from businesses, from organizations and from individuals on Bill 148.", "The very first person that we heard from that day was a businessman by the name of Helmi Ansari. He and his wife, Mehreen, own a company called Grosche International. They sell tea and coffee accessories. Their warehouse is in the city of Cambridge, and they have a retail store in Guelph.", "We have heard the opposition Conservatives this afternoon predict a very negative impact if we go to a minimum wage of $15 an hour. But when Helmi came before our committee, he had a very different story to tell. He started his business 10 years ago with his wife in the laundry room of their house. They now have grown to 10 employees.", "Helmi pays a living wage. He told us that, and he was very proud to tell us that. Here’s why his employees are started now at $16.50 an hour at both the warehouse and in the retail store.", "A few years ago, one of his employees came to him to resign. At the time, Helmi was paying the minimum wage. Helmi asked that employee—his favourite employee, who worked very hard—why he was quitting. The employee said, “Because of money.” He was going to get a job at an office supply retailer, and they were going to pay him about $13.50 an hour. Helmi said, “If you stay, I will pay you more money.” He was not looking forward to the prospects of having to find a new person and having to train them, as that, of course, costs time and money. That employee decided to stay because he was offered more money.", "Helmi says he came to the realization that, as an employer, he wanted to do one of four things: He wanted to take care of people—that’s his customers—he wanted to take care of his staff, he wanted to be a good steward for the environment, and he wanted to be a good local and global citizen in the economy. Those are his core values.", "We’ve heard today what politicians think of Bill 148. We’ve heard predictions by the opposition Conservatives on how it’s going to spell gloom and doom. But I think that we really ought to be listening to businessmen like Helmi Ansari.", "These are his own words; I want to share what he said to us. He said, “In retail, we were told you have to wait two or three years until you break even. Well, you know what? We pay a living wage, which, in Guelph, is $16.50 an hour, and we were at break-even and we were profitable in year one. We think one of the reasons we were profitable and successful is because we take care of our staff, and our staff takes care of our customers.... That is the key to business growth.”", "He goes on to say, “From a responsibility perspective, being good social citizens in the local economy, we were paying $12.50 an hour when the minimum wage was $10” an hour. “We thought we were doing okay. We thought, ‘Hey, we’re paying more than minimum. We must be good to our staff.’", "“When I learned about what a living wage was, and when I learned about the fact that people who worked for me, who I thought I cared about, were actually living near the poverty line, I had to really take a step back, take a deep breath and say, ‘I’m not really being true to what I profess is my business vision, my business philosophy, of taking care of my staff.’”", "He concluded with this: “So we became a living wage employer; we became a living wage champion. As a result, we found that our turnover, especially at these levels of low wages, has been incredibly low. We’ve had no churn at that level. Our staff actually goes out and talks about our business, and they’re proud of working for a business that has these values and that tries to stay true to them, especially in retail. The engagement has been phenomenal.”", "So, to those who are raising false alarms, trying to incite fear, on the other side of the House: The lived experiences of businessmen like Helmi Ansari and his family truly tell a different story. His philosophy—and we believe in it—is to take care of your employees; it’s good for the economy and it’s good for the bottom line.", "We have heard the opposition Conservatives say that they’re against this bill. That’s disappointing. We look forward to getting support from the third party.", "I now defer to my colleague." ],

So to say that they get tips, so it’s okay, is not a justification at all.", "The other thing is about students. When students are performing exactly the same work as the person they are working beside, they should get paid the same. Their age should not be a factor in how much they earn.

In June, I sent out a survey to some 2,000 businesses in Parry Sound–Muskoka. I received more than 200 responses, and I want to share with you those responses.", "Asked how the government’s planned increase in the minimum wage would impact their businesses, and invited to check all that apply:", "—17% said it would have no impact;", "—not a single person said it would help their business;", "—18% said it would be a challenge but they would manage;", "—60% said they would raise prices;", "—45% said they would cut employee hours;", "—29% said they would lay off staff;", "—8% said they would close.", "The proposal to require employees to be paid for three hours for shifts cancelled within 48 hours also received some strong responses. Almost 40% of businesses said they could not run their business this way, including restaurants, tourism operators, golf courses and construction companies. Many of these businesses indicated their operations are weather-dependent and they cannot schedule based on weather forecasts two days out.", "Those businesses that have employees on call have concerns about the provision requiring three hours’ pay for being on call. Of these businesses, 20% said they would raise prices, 31% said they would eliminate on-call services, and 42% said they were not sure how they would deal with this provision. The respondents most concerned about this provision are in the towing and snow removal businesses, obviously businesses where it is impossible to predict when services will be needed and what services are needed.", "Perhaps the most disturbing statistic from the responses to my survey is that, when asked whether they would choose to start a business in Ontario now, 49% said no, 29% said they weren’t sure, and only 21% said yes. Almost 80% weren’t sure whether they would open a business in Ontario under the current conditions.", "Over the past month or so, I have been visiting some of the businesses that responded to my survey.

In fact, he said that if the $15 minimum wage were implemented over five years instead of over 15 months, 75% fewer jobs would be lost. Let me repeat that: If the government implemented the minimum wage changes over five years instead of 15 months, 75% fewer jobs would be lost.", "This legislation was introduced and put through committee very quickly this summer, at a time when many businesses in Parry Sound–Muskoka are too busy to travel to present to a legislative committee.

One of the larger resorts told me that they would hire fewer staff and guest services would suffer, but they couldn’t raise prices enough to match this increase.", "Tourism and hospitality are very labour-intensive businesses, Mr. Speaker. They employ a lot of people and, in particular, a lot of young people. They are very price-sensitive businesses, as well. If the prices go up, customers don’t come back. Either they stay home or they go somewhere else.", "As one resort operator explained, “In our industry, our competition is not the resort next door; it is actually foreign operations on things such as cruise ships registered in ports of convenience to circumvent labour laws and in countries such as Cuba, where things like CPP and EI do not exist. Resorts cannot simply raise prices or our customers will go elsewhere.”", "I visited Rick Breckbill at Severn Lodge in Port Severn. His family has run the lodge for generations.

The tourism and hospitality industry is a delicate balance of so many factors, including seasonality, weather, contracts, suppliers, and competitive global economic factors. The short time for implementation drastically affects all business planning that will more than likely halt any capital improvements and provide us with no clear understanding of the inevitable rising costs of doing business. The provisions in the Changing Workplaces Review would definitely challenge the viability of our business.” He has three pages of the letter, but I just wanted to highlight that one part of it.", "Don’s Bakery in Bala is another iconic tourist attraction. Jana Foster wrote to the committee and told them, “The increase in minimum wage will severely impact us.

I really hope they can survive this double-barrelled attack.", "Someone else who wrote to the committee was Kathy Sheridan, owner of Reflections of Muskoka on the main street of Huntsville. “I have been in business in Huntsville for 30 years. Raising the minimum wage will make me consider closing my business and retiring. We have a hard enough battle with the big box stores moving in and online shopping.”", "Another store owner, this one in Parry Sound, said that she already pays $15 per hour in order to attract better candidates for positions. “If that becomes the bottom of the pay scale, I can’t compete. I cannot raise what I pay—increased wages and the corresponding employer costs will mean that I will have to scale back on staffing and work more myself, more than five days a week.”", "This was something I heard from a number of employers: that they would simply take on more of the work themselves and hire fewer people or offer staff fewer hours. Not only does this hurt the employees in the short term; it hurts business in the long term. As one sports store owner said, “We will have to cut employee hours, which means owners taking more time away from building the business to simply run it.”", "One convenience store owner who has two stores said that he would likely close one location and work more hours himself. He also commented that if the government is raising the minimum wage, they should also increase the commission rates on lottery tickets.", "Businesses in smaller communities are especially concerned because this will not only hurt their business but their whole community. One gas station owner told me, “Small-town impact is big when you have to close early. We’ll lose business; people will travel elsewhere and not come back.”", "A grocery store owner said, “We’ll have to shorten store hours in the off season, forcing customers to shop out of town.”", "A café owner in a smaller community in my riding told me, “Because about 90% of my year-round clients are on a fixed income, I cannot raise my prices enough to compensate for this. I may have to close the doors. The government is not giving them a raise.”", "His comments were backed up by some individuals who have contacted my office. One senior from Huntsville wrote in to say, “We are seniors on a fixed income. What do we cut out next to afford the increases in the costs of goods that the wage increase will create?”", "Another individual who was injured at work many years ago and lives off of workers’ compensation payments is concerned that his income won’t go up but that his costs will go up. What about those people on Ontario Works or ODSP? They will see their costs of living go up but won’t see a similar increase. They are right. As I said before, 60% of businesses told me they would raise prices to adopt a higher minimum wage.", "One restaurant owner in Huntsville said this: “Makes me wonder if I even want to be in business anymore. We have struggled for 38 years to make ends meet and keep our employees employed during the slow winter months even though the sales weren’t there.”", "A large marina and boat retailer told me: “If I have to pay my unskilled employees $15 per hour, my skilled workers who are currently making $15 to $16 an hour will want $20; those making $20 will want $25, etc.... In addition my CPP and EI contributions will increase as they are based on a percentage. We currently pay 45% of every gross profit dollar to wages. This will escalate that to 48%. My competitors in the US and elsewhere in Canada have an average of 38% of gross profits going to labour costs.”", "On the scheduling issue: Many businesses were opposed to the provision requiring employees be paid three hours’ wages for shifts cancelled within 48 hours, particularly weather-dependent businesses like golf courses, resorts, construction firms, restaurants with patios and tour operators.", "How, for example, is a golf course supposed to pay its employees for three hours on a day when it rains? I met with a golf course company in Muskoka that has three 18-hole golf courses, and they pointed out that with the weather we had this spring—of course, it was raining just about all the time—they had a forecast on Thursday for a sunny Saturday. All three courses were fully booked. Then, of course, Saturday rolled around and it rained, as it did most of this spring, and they ended up with six golfers in total for all three courses. Under the new rules, they would, with no revenue coming in, have to pay all of the staff scheduled to come in, despite having no business. The golf course business is a business that is quite marginal, and this company figured that the cost would be about $2 million to them. I noticed that a Parry Sound golf course—talking about increasing prices—just announced that as a result of Bill 148, specifically cited, their rates are going up 7% next year.", "On call: Another part of this bill that elicited some strong responses was the requirement to pay employees three hours’ work for being on call. We live in Ontario; we have winter. Snowplow drivers are essentially on call for four or five months. I heard from landscaping firms that offer snowplowing services in the winter who said their prices will skyrocket just to pay the drivers for all the days it doesn’t snow. In my riding, we could have people who won’t be able to afford to contract a company to plow their driveway. What happens if they need to call an ambulance but their driveway hasn’t been plowed? How are small municipalities with a population of 1,000 people or less—let me tell you, I have lots of those municipalities—going to afford to pay their snowplow drivers?", "What about towing companies? I met with Doug Nelson, executive director of the Provincial Towing Association of Ontario, and he also wrote to the committee. He’s based in Bracebridge, in Muskoka. He explained that the towing industry has already seen unprecedented increases in costs of doing business and that Ontario has seen a 25% reduction in the number of registered towing companies since 2014. The cost of having a light-duty tow operator on call will be $75 per day; a heavy-duty tow operator $125 per day. All in total, this bill could cost an average tow operator with 15 staff on call $500,000 a year.", "I want to quote from Doug Nelson’s letter to the committee: “In rural Ontario and small cities things become even more complicated as many tow operators utilize drivers on call but seldom have more than a few after-hours calls per month. Our member in Windsor, for example, provides an average of 11 ‘after-hours’ service calls per month. Using these figures and an average consumer price of $100, the contractor would be in the red. Eleven calls times 100 means $1,100 versus $75 per day times 30 days equals $2,250 in on-call labour costs, or a $1,150 loss. On-call pay will more than double the payroll expenses. A cost of a simple boost or lockout would increase from $75 to over $200.”", "As a result, towing companies will have to double or even triple prices, or cancel after-hours services, or get out of the business entirely. If some towing companies get out of the business or stop offering 24/7 services, motorists will wait a lot longer when they need a tow truck. In the middle of winter, this could be dangerous. Someone could be waiting for hours in a disabled car without heat. I ask this government, please consider the dangers this could pose and exempt emergency services like towing companies from this provision.", "All the comments I heard echoed the conclusions of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce that this legislation could cost 185,000 jobs across Ontario over the next two years. The Financial Accountability Officer agreed that this legislation will cost jobs. His estimate was 50,000 jobs or more, and mainly jobs held by young people.", "In 2014, the Northern Policy Institute, an institution created by this government, released a report entitled Minimum Wages: Good Politics, Bad Economics? The executive summary starts as follows: “Increasing the minimum wage tends to be very popular with the general public and so is equally popular with politicians eager to secure the support of that public come election time. However, Morley Gunderson outlines here, yet again, that good politics does not necessarily translate into good economics.” I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that this bill has more to do with an election next June 7 than anything else.", "The gentleman who wrote this paper, Dr. Morley Gunderson, is a professor at the Centre for Industrial Relations and Human Resources in the department of economics at the University of Toronto. Dr. Gunderson warns that the unintended consequences of significant minimum wage increases could hurt the very people the policy was intended to help.", "He’s right. A restaurant owner in Parry Sound told me, “I will be reducing staff wherever possible to reduce costs. This will mostly be part-time people who work one or two shifts a week. Unfortunately, they would tend to be students and single mothers.”", "Dr. Gunderson concludes: “Consistent with evidence-based policy making and the negative effects outlined ... make the minimum wage increases modest, where ‘modest’ would be determined by the economic conditions of the time and especially the state of the youth labour market. As the expression goes: ‘As long as the floor is not raised too much, the roof is not likely to fall in.’”", "So this government isn’t listening to business, either individual businesses or the chamber of commerce. They aren’t listening to their own advisers, like the Northern Policy Institute or the Financial Accountability Officer. The government refused our suggestion of requiring an independent economic analysis before implementing these changes, so they aren’t willing to listen to that.", "Perhaps they will listen to Santa Claus, or rather, the owner of Santa’s Village in Bracebridge. The committee received a letter from the owner, Mr. Dunkley. He wrote to the committee, and I want to read from this letter:", "“Our main concern with the proposed legislation is the magnitude of the increase and the short time period over which it is” being “phased in. Anyone who has ever managed a small business will tell you that a 33% increase in labour costs over such a short period is an impossible challenge to overcome. This will lead to business closures and job losses, as it will leave employers with no alternatives.... This will force some businesses to eat into capital that would otherwise be used to grow the business thereby creating additional jobs. In many cases it will ultimately force businesses to close.”", "Mr. Dunkley goes on: “I implore you to think of the family-owned restaurants, convenience stores and resorts in Ontario that will have no choice but to close. For those businesses lucky enough to have access to capital, automation to reduce employment levels may serve as a lifeline to sustainability, but this will mean fewer jobs in Ontario. To ensure the survival of our business and to protect the livelihoods and futures of as many of our employees as possible, we have already started plans to reduce paid positions next year using automation as a direct result of the government’s action.”", "Finally, I want to quote one last business owner, a restaurateur in Parry Sound, who summed up the PC position on this bill perfectly: “I am not against a minimum-wage increase ... I am, however, objecting to the accelerated process of this increase that puts a tremendous burden on the small business community only for the purpose of re-election.”" ],

I hope the government is listening, because, obviously, they should be listening to the concerns of small business and coming up with ways to develop new policy to offset the costs that small business will have to go through because of this.", "Having said that, I would also hope that the people who work in the small businesses in Muskoka, who work in the tourist trade in Muskoka, would be favourable towards an increase in the minimum wage. That will allow them to spend more money in the small businesses that they work for, or the small businesses across the street from where they work. I do see it as an opportunity for the people working in the tourist trade to put more nutritious food on the table, to put better shoes on the feet of their children, to put warmer jackets on the backs of their children as we go into the colder months. This increase will help those who don’t have a lot of money to spend, because they’re not really compensated that well, working part-time hours in tourist areas.", "The bill is flawed; it can be improved.

He talked about my great friend Morley Gunderson, who taught me when I was at the University of Toronto in the industrial relations program many, many years ago. In Mr. Gunderson’s remarks, he talks about how it “could have” this effect—he doesn’t say it will—whereas the economists that we’re listening to are saying very clearly—I’ve got here John Schmitt, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research: “Across all of the empirical research that has investigated the issue, minimum-wage increases are consistently associated with statistically significant and economically meaningful increases in the wages of affected workers” and there will be “no discernible effect on the employment prospects of low-wage workers.”", "So let’s be very clear: Let’s use the body of the evidence and not just rely on the naysayers and the people who just don’t want to see people have a living wage." ],

Amazon is now the third-largest retailer, if I’m not mistaken, in the world. That means that when people are buying, they’re not always spending locally. People aren’t merely spending in their local economy. They’re buying American goods. They’re buying goods from other parts of our country.", "We’re an interjurisdictional economy, and that means it’s very, very difficult for members of the agricultural community in my riding, who are doing their best to produce made-in-Ontario goods at competitive prices—as it is, they’re being pressed by hydro prices, they’re being pressed by cap-and-trade, and now they’re being pressed by federal tax changes.

The demographic is such that we have many more seniors. Seniors are being forced to go to the food bank right now. With increased costs, they aren’t going to see any benefit from this; all they’re going to see is the increased cost. They’re on a fixed income. They’ve already been forced, with very high increases in all their costs, especially hydro rates the last number of years—more and more of them are going to the food bank. All this bill is going to do is it’s going to force even more of them to go to the food bank. They won’t see any benefit. Anybody who is on Ontario Works, ODSP or workers’ comp and all those seniors, of which I have a huge percentage in my riding, will not see any benefit. It will hurt them.", "In the resort business, which is so important in my area, going back to Rick Breckbill from Severn Lodge, he points out, “The resort industry in Ontario has been crippled in recent years dealing with several severe recessions, geometric increases in labour rates, significantly higher costs for food, hydro, fuel and other. And now, with the proposed 32% increase in minimum wage scheduled over the next 18 months, we will have no recourse but to change the nature of our business and reduce even further our labour force.” He points out that “over 80% of our employees are students whose job at Severn Lodge is a summer job, not a career job. They have no training and no skills when they come to us. All they bring to their job is a desire for a great summer experience while earning a little bit of money to help pay for their schooling or spending money during their school year.”", "This is going to really affect all those many businesses in Parry Sound–Muskoka.

  "text" : [ "I’m so pleased to stand in my place to talk about Bill 148. I had the joy and privilege to be part of the delegation processes that happened over the summer and was hoping that that process would actually result in some substantive changes to the legislation.", "I want to give a special shout-out to the member from Welland, Cindy Forster, who helped shepherd this piece of legislation through this House to the best of her abilities as a third party member. She raised so many issues, so many gaps, actually, with regard to this piece of legislation, and I think it’s so important for us to acknowledge the work that members do in this House.", "You’ll know, of course, that the member from Welland has had such a very difficult year and can connect Bill 148 to her own experience with regard to dealing with health care workers not only in Welland but in Toronto as well. She’s been very forthcoming and very honest about what that experience looked like around the privatization and the contracting out of health care services as it related to her husband Brian’s health. I’ve said publicly in this House that if the member from Welland had not been able to navigate, as a member of provincial Parliament, the health care system and all of its respective contracting-out services, she believes, and I believe as well, that her husband would not have survived. She literally saved her husband’s life, helping to navigate and holding this health care system to account.", "That relates to Bill 148 on a number of levels. We should remember that this government has had almost two decades—17 years, 18 years by the time we go into election 2018—to make workplaces better for the workers in the province, to improve working conditions and to improve the home/work-life balance, and all of those issues that affect the quality of public services, quite honestly. This government, by all accounts, when it’s all said and done, will have had close to 16 years to do something on workplace safety, the quality of those worker experiences in the province of Ontario.", "People came out to these sessions, and one particular delegation stands with me, Mr. Speaker. This was an individual who worked three part-time jobs here in the GTA. He had a wife who also worked two part-time jobs, and they had two children for whom they struggled to cobble together child care. It was a very emotional presentation to this committee. We heard from various interests throughout the summer, but when an individual takes time off from his three part-time, very precarious contract work situations to come and speak to the legislators of this House, he has my full attention. He spoke about the quality of his family life. He talked about the fact that both he and his wife had early onset diabetes because of stress, because of exhaustion, because they really had very little time to do any kind of self-care as workers in Ontario.", "It was interesting, because he was educated. He alluded to the fact that clearly he was struggling as a younger middle-aged professional to access this world of work in a significant way; in other words, to find a full-time job. In order to make ends meet, he had to work these three part-time jobs. He said he had very little time to be part of the family he helped create, to spend time with his children, to participate in the school community. At the end of it, he said he really felt that his employers were making use of the loopholes that existed in the Employment Standards Act. He was very clear on that.", "So he took a great risk, if you think about it. Think about the courage it takes to be a precarious worker in the province of Ontario and take a day off to come and tell us, as lawmakers, that the law you crafted, Bill 148, through the Employment Standards Act and its respective other schedules, was insufficient. It wasn’t going to fix the problem. His voice, his experience, should be truly respected.", "I remember there was a member from the PC caucus who said, “Well, listen, if we increase the minimum wage, you’re probably going to lose one of those three part-time jobs.” You know what this man said? You can double-check it; it’s part of Hansard. He said, “I deserve to live my life with dignity and with integrity.”", "That should be the deciding factor in how we craft this legislation. It was a very powerful moment for me, and I know that it was emotional for him, because he is one of the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of Ontarians who are literally at the breaking point of trying to cobble together—they’re hard workers. They want to be part of this economy. They want to contribute to the province of Ontario. And they are from every jurisdiction.", "The member from Welland spoke very eloquently about, in particular, the health care workers. I’ve had this experience in my own riding, where the CCAC has now been absorbed into the LHIN and somehow, magically, that’s going to solve all the problems. We all know that will not happen. Through that process—and across the entire province—the LHIN has been desperately trying to contract out the personal support workers. Now, PSWs are predominantly a female-dominated field. You would be hard-pressed, actually, to find many men, but they are there. Personal support workers enter the health care sector because they truly care about people and they want to be part of the solution on health care.", "Quite honestly, for a long time in the province of Ontario, personal support workers have been holding the frayed fabric of our health care system together, God love them, but they also have reached this tipping point—this tipping which has been created by this government, which started a long time ago in the privatization of health care services. Quite honestly, when you listen to them, they get split shifts, so three hours in the morning to deal with some very vulnerable seniors—primarily seniors, but sometimes those who have great disabilities and are not able to take care of themselves independently—and then they get the split shift at the end of the day. And then they don’t even get the mileage in between those particular jobs.", "They can say that the job is physically demanding and it’s emotionally demanding, but the thing that bothers them the most is leaving that 72-year-old in that hot apartment—or cold apartment, what have you—and knowing that that senior is not going to see anybody else that day. That is called emotional labour. Does this piece of legislation address any of those working standards for these marginalized workers? Who would have ever thought that people working in the health care field would be regarded as marginalized workers? Yet they are. They are voiceless, except come election time when they are promised a dollar here and a dollar there—as if that would fix the system.", "So here you have the LHINs contracting out. The member from Welland did a much better job than me in addressing it, but she said that you can’t have a for-profit operator who has a contract with the LHIN, no longer the CCAC—and at the end of the day, they are scheduled based on the money that the third-party operator wants to make. They have a profit agenda. That profit agenda trumps, supersedes and then undermines the level of service that health care workers in the province of Ontario are able to provide.", "Why is that? Why has this Liberal government ceded full control of our health care system, particularly with home care, to third-party operators? I ask you that honestly, because it doesn’t make any sense. The Auditor General herself identified—and this is from the 2016 Auditor General report—that up to 40% of the home care funding was going to administration, it was going to bureaucracy and it was going for profit. This is not a health care system that can afford one dollar, never mind 40% of the home care dollars, which she costed out to be $2.1 billion, going to the profit margin." ],

In fact, New Democrats would argue that with education, health care, public safety and the environment, profit should not factor in.", "I’m going to identify now one of the key pieces that I think the member from Welland saw in Bill 148—and I think, actually, there could be possibly some agreement with the PC Party on this—in that there was some reluctance on the part of this government to address the worker experience, the quality of that work, this concept of equal pay for equal work—which we’ve heard. We’ve heard from the other side of this House, “Equal pay for equal work.” Yet you have professors in the college system and in the university system in the province of Ontario who are doing equal work. They are professors in the classroom and our post-secondary institutions. They are delivering quality education services. They are supremely qualified, but they cannot get a full-time job—or even a full-time part-time job—in any of our institutions.", "I’m going to tell you why this matters. This matters because you have a contract faculty member who teaches at York in the morning, then travels to Wilfrid Laurier University for the afternoon and sometimes does an evening class at the end of the day. It does not allow for research potential, research opportunities, which are one of the founding principles of our university institutions: that you build knowledge through investing in research and that you transfer that knowledge and that investment into the community to make our communities better. That’s like a loss leader now, right? Then you have these faculty members who, by the end of the day—the classes are large. They don’t have class room and extra time to give to their students. They’re dropped in as if this is a McDonald’s and they’re just going to get a product for the money that they’ve paid—the highest tuition fees in the country.", "These part-time contract faculty in the college system are going to go on strike. They’re going to go on strike because they, too, have reached the tipping point in the province of Ontario. If you look at the contracted-out services of our post-secondary institutions, including our colleges, I hope that the majority of people in this House who believe in the power, in the potential of education to address basic issues of inequality would admit that our post-secondary institutions should not be part of the problem around precarious contract work. They should not be part of the problem. They should not be balancing their $100-million budgets on the backs of the custodians and the people who do the groundskeeping, and now the faculty.", "College contract faculty issued their notice last week. On October 15, they could be going on strike, because they have no benefits, they have no security of their timetable; they are paid per class, sometimes $7,500, sometimes $8,200. Sometimes they don’t know if they’re going to be teaching in the semester, based on enrolment. There’s no security. Who would have thought?", "It’s one thing for us to be talking, as I’m going to right now, about the temporary workers who were exposed in the Toronto Star article called “Undercover in Temp Nation.” These are individuals—primarily new immigrants, primarily women—who the Employment Standards Act leaves massive gaps for around accountability, around safety, around payment, around tax revenue, around compliance, regulatory compliance; I talked about this issue last week.", "This is where we are in the province of Ontario. You have the most vulnerable workers, who apparently have no rights, who are paid in cash under the table by a temp agency, who don’t feel empowered enough to even talk about their rights as workers amidst unsafe work. Then you have the other side of the spectrum, the most educated people in the province—PhDs, professors. Conestoga, York, Western, Ryerson, U of T, Queen’s—" ],

This is an exposé from the Toronto Star from September 8. It addresses the food processing issues in our food processing factories, which are in all of our ridings, quite honestly. This particular one is called Fiera Foods.", "This reporter went undercover. She received the least amount of safety protocol: five minutes of training to deal with heavy equipment. She was advised of some basic skills around, obviously, not wearing nails and having some safety boots, but in the end, there was no responsibility or oversight in this regard. She says:", "“I get about five minutes of training in a factory packed with industrial equipment.", "“I am paid in cash with no deductions or pay stubs.

Her hijab was caught in a machine, strangling her.” This is a company that had 191 workplace safety violations, and she paid with her life. “She was 23 years old. She was a refugee trying to save for nursing school. She had been on the job two weeks.” She clearly did not have the safety training that she needed.", "Now, what’s going to happen in this regard? Well, I can tell you: not much. This is a company that received government funding, both provincial funding and federal funding, for creating jobs. This would be the third death that happened at Fiera Foods. What happens, really, is that there is no responsibility when there are temp workers at a factory for WSIB to address them. I’m going to read this:", "“The company has received multiple rebates from the WSIB for their low-injury claims rate over the past decade. This year, the compensation board did not issue it a rebate because of” this one particular death. “But non-fatal injuries to temp agency employees—if they are even claimed—wouldn’t impact Fiera’s insurance premiums.”", "This is a company that did not do their due diligence for workers. It has received government funding for creating jobs. It has not addressed systemic issues. It has found the loopholes in the Liberal government’s current Employment Standards Act, which are gaping, which Bill 148 does not address—nor does it address the call for equal pay for equal work in our post-secondary institutions.", "I have to say that by not opening the Occupational Health and Safety Act, it is a missed opportunity to address the systemic issues, because whatever happens after the next election, someone in this House is going to have to address it. We cannot let our workers in the province of Ontario go to work, get injured, not be able to claim WSIB services or not come home. We can be better than that, Mr. Speaker. We need to be better than that and Bill 148 needs to be stronger." ],

We have to remember that. When I look at a single mom of four kids, in my riding—and there are lots of them—working two and three jobs at minimum wage, and they still can’t do all the things for their families that we all expect and take for granted.

We have people working part-time jobs, precarious jobs, jobs that can’t be counted on, with no benefits, making minimum wage, working all hours of the day and night, sometimes on split shifts, as we heard: You come in for two or three hours in the morning, you go home, and you work for two or three hours in the evening. You also have children to raise, and after they go to bed, you go out to another part-time job. That’s not dignity. That’s not putting nutritious food on the table.

That’s not looking after your health care needs or their health care needs.", "So when I hear people saying we might lose a few jobs if we raise the minimum wage, what about raising the standard of living in Ontario?

Employees would now be able to refuse to accept shifts without repercussions if their employers ask them to work with less than four days’ notice.

We believe that the economic studies that show in other jurisdictions that has not been the problem—in terms of people who are finding difficulty securing employment, again by putting more money into the economy, this is going to create more demand and more need for hiring.”", "I think the Minister of Labour has told us that he has some 53 economists who have written to him endorsing this approach.

Yesterday, October 1, the minimum wage went up. It is now at $11.60 an hour, as of yesterday. Under this government, the minimum wage has increased by 70%.", "I’ve been hearing concerns from my constituents on many of the issues that are in Bill 148 since I was elected in 2014. Since then, I’ve been speaking in caucus about many of the issues and many of the changes that the government is bringing forward in Bill 148. In my riding of Davenport, I’ve been taking meetings to speak with constituents about their experiences and what fair work means to them. I’ve met with organizations such as $15 and Fairness and the social justice group that meets at the Davenport-Perth Neighbourhood and Community Health Centre in my riding of Davenport. I’ve been speaking in caucus about how we need to fight for sustainable scheduling practices, equal pay for equal work, and a fair and livable minimum wage of $15 per hour.", "With the cost of housing having risen dramatically, especially in my riding of Davenport, and the cost of transit in Toronto continuing to rise, people who are making minimum wage in my community are struggling to get by and get ahead. Our plan to consistently increase the minimum wage by the rate of inflation has been better than the plan of the Conservatives and the NDP to play political games with the wages of our most vulnerable workers. But some fixed costs have been far outstripping inflation and leaving people in Davenport scrambling. That’s why, for the past three years, I’ve written letters to the Minister of Labour and asked questions in the Legislature about what we are doing and how we can do more to ensure that all Ontarians can share in our economic prosperity.", "That’s why I was so glad when our government listened to people across the province and introduced legislation last session to create more opportunity and security for workers, the Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act.", "I was also glad to have been part of the committee that travelled across the province to listen to approximately 190 presentations from members of the public, businesses, labour organizations and advocacy groups about our plan.", "One of the things we learned over the summer is that the changes we are making, like raising the minimum wage, aren’t impossible for businesses across Ontario.

In particular, there’s going to be a three-hour minimum pay when a shift gets cut short or cancelled unexpectedly. That is only fair. There are people who are anticipating to start work at a particular time, and then at the last minute they’re told not to come in. That sometimes creates chaos in their life, if they have child care or they have other events planned. Importantly, of course, they’re deprived of that income that they had planned on to meet their weekly and monthly expenses.", "However, there will be some exceptions to take into account the obvious pressures on business to accommodate that schedule, so there are built-in exceptions for weather-dependent work, for emergencies and for public safety. I think one of the members opposite in the official opposition made a big point about this. So those exceptions are built in.", "There’s also provision for two paid sick days.", "There’s provision for three weeks of vacation after five years of employment. I cannot think why an employer would not want to reward a five-year employee with the benefit of three weeks’ vacation. Obviously, if the employee has been there for five years, that employee is doing something right and is making a valuable contribution to the business.", "There are also various provisions that will support the concept of equal pay for equal work, regardless of whether it’s full-time, part-time, seasonal or temporary. Often, the contribution that part-time and temporary workers make is just as vital, just as important, as what full-time workers make, and so they should receive pay equal to the pay of full-time workers.", "There are also various leave provisions, so that one can take proper time to take care of themselves and their family. Those leave provisions revolve around child death leave, crime-related child disappearance leave, and pregnancy leave.", "These kinds of leave are designed to remove the anxiety from the employee, which will probably—with this leave to deal with these onerous family responsibilities—in the long run, make them a better employee and enable them to make a greater contribution to the work of the business.", "In a similar vein, there is separate domestic violence and sexual violence leave. Again, this is an eye to the psychological health of the employee and their families. I can’t imagine a good employer not wanting to have a healthy employee, both physically and emotionally. These provisions are designed to enhance that.", "Speaking of enforcement or keeping an eye on this new regime, there will be about 173 new employment standards officers. This will allow officers to proactively inspect, on an annual basis, about 10% of the workplaces.", "There will be increased fines for employers who break the rules. However, there will be much greater access to information when organizing and implementing these work standards. What we want to do is to ensure that the organizational process is not frustrated by an inability to reach agreements with employees.", "I want to say something about what the experts have been saying about this, because we’ve heard a lot of criticism. In fact, there’s a letter of support from 53 economists across Canada: a fellow of the Royal Society, two former presidents of the Canadian Economics Association—incidentally, which was consulted widely by former federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty. Seven Nobel Prize-winning economists support the concept of minimum wage. So we know that this is a good piece of legislation." ],

We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs that have been created since the depths of the recession in 2008, the overwhelming majority being in full-time positions and positions that pay well, helping support tens of thousands of families and helping those families realize their dream for a better life for themselves and their kids and grandkids. That’s, yes, in part because of the tremendous resilience of the people of Ontario, but it’s also because we pursued, as a government, policies, objectives and mechanisms like Bill 154 that help Ontarians realize their full potential, help our business leaders realize their full potential.", "At the same time, as I mentioned a second ago, because of the other debate we had here this afternoon, we’re making sure that the economy is both prosperous and that this prosperity is shared equitably across the province. Whether we’re talking, again, about paying individuals a minimum wage that will rise, as proposed, up to $15 an hour or we’re talking about other initiatives—as examples, OHIP+ and free tuition for currently just over 200,000 students across the province of Ontario—these are all pieces of the same larger economic and quality-of-life puzzle that we have put together. You see the results of it in every corner of the province with respect to the job creation, with respect to the prosperity. In my own area of responsibility within transportation, of course, we are investing unprecedented amounts to make sure that we have the transit and transportation networks that are helping connect individuals.", "I mentioned earlier in debate that we have a number of ministries that are working on this together. For example, Bill 154 specifically works with the Ministry of the Attorney General, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. That’s another, I think, hallmark of the Ontario Liberal government, a government that has now been in power, as we mentioned earlier today, since October 2003. This is, in fact, the fourteenth anniversary for a number of individuals who are still proud to serve on this side of the House.", "We see throughout that 14-year period of time how we have managed to collaborate, how many ministries have managed to collaborate so that, both in this legislation as proposed and previous iterations of similar legislation, we’ve managed to reduce that burden that is placed by unnecessary red tape—again, to unshackle the creativity of the people and the businesses here in this province and to make sure that we’re moving forward in the right direction.", "Speaker, another example of some of the stuff that we have done in this regard over time is the Red Tape Challenge. I know that has been discussed on a number of occasions. We introduced the Red Tape Challenge, which would be an innovative way for the government to connect with businesses and employees at all levels. We launched the Red Tape Challenge in March 2016. We have already engaged with four sectors, with three more to go. This is an innovative, online consultation platform that provides direct stakeholder feedback from seven industry sectors: auto parts manufacturing, food processing, financial services, mining, chemical manufacturing, forestry and tourism.", "The Red Tape Challenge began with the automotive parts manufacturing sector last year. I’m mentioning this because I think the results so far are quite significant. This effort resulted in 63 burden-reduction opportunities; 41 of these will be addressed within the next three years. And you see similar examples in some of the other sectors that I referenced a second ago—for example, in the financial services and food processing sector consultations. Again, a ton of opportunities have come forward that no doubt will be acted upon.", "Our colleague on this side of the House, the Minister of Economic Development and Growth, someone who is such an incredibly strong champion for the province of Ontario, not only brought forward not only this initiative, but in all of his time serving in this capacity, and previously, in other capacities at the cabinet table, he is a true champion for the people of Ontario and for the businesses here in Ontario. He is someone who understands how important it is to make sure that we are constantly luring the right kind of investment for the right places in Ontario. Because of his efforts, and because of the efforts of a number of people who have worked hard with respect to Bill 154, we see the fruits of those efforts.", "We need to be proud of the fact that we live in a province where our economic growth is ranked first or second here in this country; that we see so many jobs that are being created; and that we see so much prosperity that is not only being created but is being shared in the fairest way possible because of how we’re approaching this.", "I had the chance to hear this afternoon in the chamber from those who have already spoken on this. I think that we see that there isn’t really a compelling reason for anybody to say, from a public policy perspective, that they disagree with this concept, the concept of reducing the burden of unnecessary red tape, which I think is actually quite encouraging.", "I look forward to the debate that is going to occur not only this afternoon but over the course of the rest of the debate on Bill 154.", "We also have a number of individuals who have come forward to talk about their support for this initiative. I think that’s also encouraging, to know that we have support from a wide variety of stakeholders and from partners who recognize that we have to continue to move forward in this direction. It also helps us to understand, from a validation perspective, that we are moving forward in the right way.", "Just as an example, we see the president and CEO of OpenText: “We are an Ontario-grown global company. And we chose to invest here because of the highly educated workforce, our strong university partnerships in R&D, as well as the province’s robust and innovative start-up communities.” I point out that one example, but we have others talking about the economy and talking about the formula, the inspired formula, that our Premier, our Minister of Economic Development and Growth and our team on this side of the House have compiled, have pieced together, over the last number of years.", "I’m going to say this again, even though I’ve already mentioned it a couple of times in debate so far here today: This is a formula that is working, and it’s working for people in every corner of the province. It doesn’t mean that our work is done. That’s why we’re coming forward with this legislation; it’s why we’re talking about building a fairer society. Whether we’re talking about the economy or of the quality of life for the people that we’re proud to represent, we continue to get it done, and get it done right." ],

What I’d like to see this government do is stop creating more and more red tape, more of it than what they take away.", "Let me just give you a couple of examples. The minister is aware—I’ve sent him letters—of the atrocious, terrible service from Larry’s drive centre in Smiths Falls—horrendous, terrible service. We get complaints all the time, but they just continue to get contracts with, I would say, no oversight on that service provider.", "I had the example this summer of the Willows brothers, two young fellows in Balderson who had their A-Z licences set up for June 27 this summer, and the Serco-operated drive centre in Smiths Falls had them all booked, had them reserved. They went in, but Serco couldn’t provide the driver’s examination that day. They got bumped to a couple of weeks later. Of course, that new regulation came into effect July 1 which required the Willows brothers each to pay $10,000 and take a new training program approved by the Ministry of Transportation before they could get their driver’s exam—$20,000, for those two young fellows, of red tape. Unnecessary or otherwise, it’s an added cost, and those two young fellows are really finding the burdens of this government directly on their shoulders." ],

He’s right. They made a major mistake in the United Kingdom: They cut red tape across the board, including health and safety regulations. In fact, we had Conservative cabinet ministers in the United Kingdom bragging about how much red tape they cut in health and safety regulations, bragging about how they cut fire safety inspections from six hours to 45 minutes.", "Of course, we know what happened on June 14, 2017—this year: that terrible, horrific fire at the Grenfell Tower, a 24-storey housing complex. Eighty people died and 70 were injured. Some people say it’s an older building. Well, it was built in the 1970s in England—that’s not old. England’s got a lot of older buildings. It was the cladding on that building that was put on a few years ago, cladding that was known across Europe to be a safety risk and a fire hazard. Other countries had banned it, yet because of the cut in health and safety regulations in the United Kingdom, we had that horrific fire.", "They allowed the housing industry there to self-police themselves. They got rid of health and safety inspectors and said to the housing people, “Yes, I know you’re going to put profit ahead of health and safety, but just do it so that you police yourselves and we’ll be okay.”", "Well, that’s not okay.

The whole process of taking a look at the regulations and things that we set as a—we build a framework of legislation and then we use these regulations as tools to fill in that framework.

He said that the majority of the city was built with foreign investment. I asked the staff, “How did you do that?” “Because we cut all the unnecessary red tape drastically.” They invited all of the investment. Not only that; they had all kinds of economic incentive. Until the new foreign businesses build up their businesses, they have a grace period, so you don’t have to pay so much tax.

We aspire to be the economic engine of Canada once again in this province, and a B just doesn’t cut it.", "I’ve been in touch with many stakeholders throughout my years who have brought forward many concerns that they have on unnecessary red tape. Members who were here following the 2011 election will remember my efforts to reform the Technical Standards and Safety Authority. Businesses subject to their licensing regime live in apprehension of additional requirements that an inspector may add and arbitrarily impose on them above and beyond what is required by the agency’s own standards. When inspectors change, a business may find itself regulated out of business almost overnight.", "Inspectors who create tools in accordance with internationally accepted and used standards can’t get their equipment installed in Ontario because of the TSSA’s field approval procedure. When a field approval costs more than the equipment itself, what’s the point of installing it?", "I have a couple of manufacturers in my riding. One produces products that are used all over the world. After an installation, he said that he was at $50,000 trying to get the equipment okayed to move ahead. He said, “There’s no standards. You’re working towards a target that’s constantly moving.” He said he finally pulled the thing out. He won’t do any more work in Ontario.", "I had another contractor talk to me. He said, “You’ll put in a piece of equipment for $5,000 or $6,000, and the inspection costs are $15,000.” The problem we have there is the fact that the TSSA doesn’t accept the compressed gas standard, which is used internationally all over the world. You can install the equipment anywhere in the US and in the rest of the nine provinces; you can’t install it in Ontario, because there’s a regulation on the books about having to be CSA approved. There’s some merit to that, except the CSA doesn’t take authority over compressed gas. It relies on the international standard. That’s just one of the issues here.", "He said that the problem is, you give them the cost of the equipment and you say, “You’re going to have to contact the TSSA to inspect it. Then we don’t get the contract.” You drive by and you see Quebec licence plates in the yard. They’re there selling equipment because they don’t have to call the TSSA. It just gets done without inspection. That’s the type of thing we see going on. That’s not healthy.", "The government’s initiatives on red tape were often rich in ambition, but lacking in substance. I read some of this bill—and we talked about bills that get named by this government. The bill is supposedly directed toward reduction in red tape.", "Here’s one from the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change: “Where the director refuses to issue or cancels a permit or imposes or alters a term or condition in a permit that has been issued, the permittee now has seven days to make submissions for reconsideration, rather than 15.” So now they’ve made it more difficult for a company to actually appeal something. It says, “The director now has seven days to reconsider the decision after receiving the submissions, rather than three.” I’m not sure how that could be considered a reduction in anybody’s mind.", "Another one, under the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services: “The schedule expands the minister’s regulation-making powers. They include the making of regulations in respect of the content, form, format and filing of various documents.”", "It allows “the director or the registrar, as applicable, to require different filing obligations for any of the prescribed supporting documents....", "“A minister may require a business that interacts with the minister to provide the minister with the business’ business information (name, contact … etc.), if there is an inter-ministerial agreement relating to that kind of interaction.”", "So we see in this case that more information is required. That’s not in any way reducing regulation.", "I see that I don’t have a lot of time, so I’ll get to something that was in Ontario Home Builder—a major industry in our province. I’ll just read some of the parts talking about building and the cost of housing:", "“Since we all have to live somewhere, it’s no surprise that the topic generates lots of discussion. Government likes to talk about it too. But they take it a step further and they’re fond of discussing affordable housing. In fact, it seems that every time any level of government makes an announcement, they insist the decision will ensure all Ontarians will have more affordable housing.", "“With all the government chatter about the subject, you’d think that they were busy reducing taxes, fees, charges or red tape to support lower housing costs. But housing prices just keep going up, and all levels of government keep piling on new taxes and red tape.", "“All the government talk of affordability never really amounts to the homebuyer saving money. In fact, it is the homebuyer who continues to absorb these costs in the price of a new home. So while government sees our industry as an endless source of revenue, in reality, the people of the province pay the price.”", "That just goes to show how it’s impacting our housing industry. We see that every day.", "Another simple example is in the change to the building code: You can no longer put up a reasonably small tent without getting it stamped and inspected by an engineer. You’re taking a cheap solution that was $400 or $500 and putting it over $1,000. I hear that problem every day. There’s no question, you need some regulations, but this is not something that typically—these people are experts who put these tents up. One of the consulting engineers who gets called to inspect them was sitting in Cornwall waiting for a tent to be put up for a few hours of volunteer—they were raising money for a local charity. He said, “It’s embarrassing for me to go onsite. I see people who have been putting up tents for decades. I’m sitting there and I have to inspect them and sign something off and then leave. I’ve got to charge to cover my insurance. When is enough enough?”", "This government looks at the citizens of Ontario like a candy dish—“How can I get more money from them?”—instead of actually making it so that our businesses are more and more economical.", "In the farming industry—I was at home on the weekend, and they’re taking soybeans off. The soybean price comes from Chicago. We have no impact on that at all. But we look at the regulations that are being brought down on the farming community—and I heard the minister say, “Well, they can just alter the prices.” They can’t alter the prices. The prices are fixed daily based on what they are in Chicago. So we see farmers who have to deal with this, have to deal with the high cost of power, have to deal with the regulations—all that this government has put on.", "So we truly would like to see, when they come out with a bill, instead of giving one message that maybe is contrary to what we see in the bill, that they actually follow through and cut the cost of doing business so we have more good-paying jobs—jobs that aren’t leaving this country and going elsewhere.", "It’s unfortunate; I know my time is up.

Every time, there was nothing really found.", "I was talking to somebody that worked for the Ministry of Transportation. He was saying that the supervisor came out and said, “Okay, we need to up the numbers.” But he said, “No more Bell trucks,” because the reason they were pulling them over was because they were quick, they could do them and get their numbers up, tick it off, and there would be no paperwork. They assumed there would be no paperwork because there were no problems with them.", "This is what we see happening under this government: You have an industry picked on just because they have a good safety record. You’re wondering why you’re being pulled over, and it’s the fact that—“Well, we can do it and check you off, and there’s another stop and another inspection that I didn’t find anything.”", "We’ve got to get away from this and look at how we can help industry instead of how we can damage their ability to be profitable and to create good employment." ],

There are many complex parts to the legislation, which amends over 100 different acts and proposes the creation of a new act, the Reducing Regulatory Costs for Business Act, 2017.", "Mr. Speaker, the way I see it, this legislation is the equivalent of our province going to the dentist to have its cavities filled. The bill is about making updates to legislation that is outdated or unnecessary. By tackling each of these issues, we can address everything effectively. There is no point in going to the dentist to fill one cavity if we have a lot of cavities.", "However, there are elements of this bill which concern me.

This amendment could make it so that more than one vice-chair of the Normal Farm Practices Protection Board would be appointed. The reason for appointing another vice-chair of this board is very practical, in my opinion. This will make it so that wait times for hearings can be reduced during periods when there are more farmers having their cases heard. This is clearly a good change that makes the board more efficient. With this amendment, we will fill our first cavity.", "Some more beneficial amendments within Bill 154 are—", "Interjection." ],

These reforms would be included in the Corporations Act. They would allow Ontario not-for-profit corporations to electronically send notice of membership meetings. They would also be able to hold members’ meetings using electronic devices to communicate. My initial reaction to this was: How have we not permitted non-profits to do this already? This amendment could not come soon enough. It could increase flexibility and encourage member participation in meetings.", "Changes to the Charities Accounting Act also include the additions of three new sections: 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4. This allows the charities to make social investments through trust properties. This type of investment would be made with the purpose of gaining financial return in cases where spending resources might not achieve as positive an outcome. Basically, a charity could put its returns into an investment that promises accumulated gains. This would allow the charity to accomplish more ambitious goals.", "The purpose behind these amendments would be giving the charities more flexibility and power to help reach their objectives.

Someone making a complaint against a judge at this level will no longer make the complaint to the Ontario Judicial Council and a provincial judge. Instead, those making a complaint will follow the process used for complaints and disciplines issued against a provincial judge.

Without this information, entrepreneurs will likely be deterred from investing.", "As it stands, the legislation does not make any significant modifications to the amount of information provided to entrepreneurs considering the purchase of a franchise.

I should say at the outset that I will be sharing my time with my colleague the member for Kitchener–Conestoga.", "I was eager to speak on Bill 10 because it’s an issue of major concern to the people in my riding of Leeds–Grenville. We know that the viability of the child care system in rural parts of Ontario like Leeds–Grenville would be at risk if we allowed Bill 10 to go through as it is, so I wanted to have the opportunity to stand here, on behalf of parents and child care providers I represent, to bring their views to the floor of the Legislature in this very important debate. I wanted to do so before the government inevitably moves to cut debate off on Bill 10, as they have done with other pieces of legislation since we came back here in the chamber.", "Off the top, I want to commend our PC education critic, the member for Simcoe North, Mr. Garfield Dunlop. He has done an outstanding job outlining the very serious concerns with aspects of Bill 10. It’s important for government members who are here today to listen to the debate from our side and understand where our concerns are coming from. Our critic has worked tirelessly to go out and meet with stakeholders, particularly those private daycare operators who have been, I suggest, completely ignored by the government. That’s who the member for Simcoe North is. When he was our critic for skilled trades, he came to Leeds–Grenville and met with dozens of tradesmen in my riding to hear their concerns about the College of Trades. I suggest he has taken the same approach with this particular piece of legislation. From what he has heard, very clearly, Bill 10 is going to have an absolutely catastrophic result for those that are private operators and for the ability of parents to choose the care that’s best for them.", "I’ve heard the minister and other members describing what we’re saying as fear mongering by the opposition. Of course that’s what they’re going to say, Speaker, because the government knows they can’t argue with the facts. So we’re left to choose between our critic, who has tirelessly toured the province and listened to those affected by Bill 10, or the minister’s empty promises that everything is going to be all right. Well, it’s a pretty easy choice for me. I’m going to look at the debate from Mr. Dunlop’s perspective, and I’m going to keep an open mind to some of the other members.", "But it’s a very complex piece of legislation. In fact, it amends more than a dozen other acts: everything from the Assessment Act and the Income Tax Act to the Pay Equity Act and even the Smoke-Free Ontario Act. We also need to recognize the incredible number of people who are going to be affected by Bill 10. Our estimate puts the number at about 70,000 child care providers and approximately 350,000 children in care and their parents.", "The reality is, if the bill passes as it is written now, we’re going to see parents lose child care options. Our estimate is that this legislation will eliminate 140,000 child care spaces in Ontario, many of them in rural parts of the province, like my riding. That’s because we will see child care providers forced out of business. We will see parents facing an increase of 30% to 40% in daycare fees to make up for the shortfall of income to providers. As I said earlier, the parts of Ontario that stand to lose most because of this piece of legislation are rural areas.", "It’s for that reason that I and my colleagues and my caucus, for that matter, are calling for province-wide hearings on Bill 10. We need an all-party committee of the Legislative Assembly to do what Mr. Dunlop does in his role of critic, and that’s go out to other parts of Ontario and hold meetings and listen to people. We need to hear from parents and child care providers in the north, in southwestern Ontario, in central Ontario, in eastern Ontario. The government needs to understand that Ontario exists outside of the GTA. The families and the hard-working independent daycare operators out there face dire consequences as a result of this government’s desire to create a one-size-fits-all system of child care.", "I know the minister is eager to get Bill 10 rammed down our throats because of the Ombudsman’s report, which basically shone a light on this government’s terrible record on this file. You don’t make up for 12 years of—and I’ll use the Ombudsman’s words—“systematic government ineptitude” by rushing in legislation without fully examining its consequences. I would think a Minister of Education of all people knows that old proverb: “Two wrongs don’t make a right.” That’s exactly what she’s doing with Bill 10.", "It’s a bill in need of serious revision, because what we have in it now won’t improve the safety of children in care; it will actually see us spending more on child care and providing less of it. That’s why our caucus is saying that we need to take a step back. We need to use the winter break as an opportunity to go out across the province and hear directly from those who will be most affected by the bill. It’s a very complex bill, and we can’t just have hearings here in Toronto; we need to go closer to these men and women who are providing this care.", "I know I only have a few moments, so I wanted to put on the record some of the comments of one of the independent child care providers in my riding who’s deeply concerned about this legislation. Cynthia Potschka operates a wonderful home daycare called the Cherished Cherubs Child Care in North Grenville. This is a bit of background about Cynthia from a letter she wrote to me:", "“I have worked in the child care industry for a good portion of the last 20 years. I currently provide a very professional child care program from my home that is highly regarded by parents and those who work in the child care field.", "“I choose to provide care from my home for a number of reasons, but one of the most important reasons is because my own experience with child care centres as a parent, ECE student and supply teacher led me to the conclusion that the type of care that is provided in a quality home child care environment is beyond compare.", "“And I wanted to be the person providing excellent care to children and their families—not just meeting a minimum standard.”", "That sets the scene about who Cynthia Potschka is, what kind of child care specialist she is, and what kind of service she provides parents in her riding. She’s an experienced, qualified, caring provider who gives parents in a rural area an option to choose an outstanding home child care setting for their kids.", "Here’s what her assessment of Bill 10 is and what it will do for her business: “It will likely force caregivers, like myself, to shut our doors. It is doubtful that I would be able to continue to operate my program the way I do … when faced with the financial costs of this legislation.”", "She notes that neither the restriction limiting her two children under two years of age or contracting with a home daycare licensing agency—and turning over 30% of her income, essentially—is viable.", "Here’s another quote, Mr. Speaker: “In order to remain open, I will have to consider an increase to my fees to a level which many families will find impossible. I would like to be in the business of caring for children for many more years to come, but it’s clear to me that the implementation of this bill will make this an unlikely long-term option.”", "She sums it up. Her words that she hopes the minister will heed: “It’s a poor piece of legislation that does not address the real child care issues in our community today. It is a piece of legislation that will, by its very nature, create a shortage of child care spaces, remove choices from families who need care, fees will increase and become unreachable, and quality will decline.", "“The circumstances of children in care will be worse, not better. Families will be under more pressure, not less. This is not the legislation that is needed to modernize child care in Ontario.”", "I could go on and on with Cynthia’s letter to me. I’ve received many other letters from other providers. Everyone is of the same mind, at least in my riding, whether they live in North Grenville, Westport, Athens or any of the other rural areas in my riding. I think they need to realize that we can’t rush down the path that the minister has put us on with Bill 10.", "We need to take a step back. We need to have some meaningful hearings across the province. We need to listen to people on what they would like to see in this bill, and we cannot allow the government House leader to ram this bill down our throats when we have so many Ontarians asking us to hold province-wide hearings and come up with a bill that gets it right.", "I’ve used up my time.

Of course, we were all horrified when that potential became a reality, and the government finally woke up to grasp the impact of its unmet responsibilities.", "The long-standing concerns, unanswered complaints and the unheard early warning signs are all spelled out very vividly in the Ombudsman’s report, Careless About Child Care. That really says it all, Speaker. The government has been careless about child care. But beyond the headlines, the stories within tell a tale of a government sleeping at the wheel, unaware of the hazards jeopardizing the safety of our children here in Ontario.", "As Mr. Marin points out in his executive summary, this government finally got its wake-up call when “over a seven-month period in 2013-2014, four young children died … in the greater Toronto area.” We all know the details of the tragedy that befell two-year-old Eva Ravikovich, who died in Vaughan on July 8, 2013, in an illegal home daycare.", "Specifically, Mr. Marin’s investigation centred on the system for responding to complaints and concerns about unlicensed child care operations, the point being that while this government has its eyes on registering and licensing, the fact is that no registration or licensing regime can work to protect the safety of our children if government is not going to respond to the complaints and concerns in the first place.", "Speaker, as the Ombudsman report points out, there are “more than 800,000 Ontario children in unlicensed care—from newborns to age 12—more than double the number in licensed settings.” I’m sure we all know examples of families who have benefited from the child care provided by relatives, nannies, friends or babysitters, and we also know the concerning stories of those who are cared for in overcrowded homes, storefronts and offices. These would be in violation of the law, in fact, the current law. So if the law was enforced, perhaps we wouldn’t see the sad stories that confront us today.", "Speaker, there’s no doubt that as waiting lists and the costs associated with licensed child care have grown, many Ontarians have turned to more affordable, more readily available informal options, often unaware of the rules and of the risks. Again, it is a government’s job—it was the government’s job before Bill 10 and it will be after Bill 10—to ensure Ontario parents are aware of the rules and know the risks before making crucial decisions on who will be protecting their children when they are at work.", "As Mr. Marin indicates, while there are hundreds of complaints every year from parents looking for government to do its job, “Regrettably, the system for receiving and responding to such complaints and concerns has suffered from entrenched organizational malaise for years.” He also points out that, “In the case of Eva Ravikovich, the ministry repeatedly failed to follow proper procedures or follow up on multiple complaints, including from children’s aid society officials. Its ineptitude allowed this brazenly illegal daycare to operate unabated for many months, until Eva’s death incited ministry officials to take action.”", "Further to that point, Marin tells us that, far from being an isolated incident, “the system for responding to complaints about unlicensed daycares included careless and inconsistent complaint intake practices. It was also infused with a reactive, passive and conflicted enforcement culture that focused on encouraging and educating illegal operators into compliance—to the detriment of ensuring the health, welfare and safety of the children.” Really, that is what is paramount here, and should be: ensuring the health, welfare and safety of children. I’m just not sure that Bill 10 is the answer, of course, in its currently written format.", "There is a long list of concerns Mr. Marin details in his overview of what is ailing a clearly broken system. He calls out the ministry for a non-existent case management system for tracking complaints about unlicensed operators, a disorganized process for documenting complaints and incomplete records, “dozens of cases where the ministry’s own directives and guidelines for responding to complaints were not followed, and where inspections of unlicensed daycare operations were delayed or skipped altogether.... such poor inspection practices as cursory and careless evidence gathering, inadequate assessment of evidence and failure to properly document inspection results” and absent training “on best practices for conducting investigations.” He adds that “many did not even possess a clear understanding of the legislation they were enforcing or of the ministry’s own policies and procedures.” Unbelievable.", "Speaker, there it is: a clearly broken system failing Ontarians in its inability to anticipate problems, register complaints or enforce the current legislation. The big question is, does Bill 10 alleviate these problems or simply build more registering and licensing into a system that continues to be unresponsive to actual violations? Because if we continue down this path, we only stand to repeat the mistakes of the past that have led to the situation where we have had 82 unlicensed caregivers facing multiple complaints, and then 23 still operating illegally on second visits and 15 remaining in violation on subsequent visits. Speaker, it doesn’t matter if we beef up our legislation if the ministry refuses to act to enforce it. That’s the bottom line: Rules and regulations are only as good as the enforcement you put behind them.", "We have so many good, diligent and safe day care providers, both licensed and unlicensed here in the province—there are clearly a few bad apples—and they’re now further impacted by a piece of legislation that has failed to really hear their voices. We call for the minister to perhaps use the winter to allow those folks to come in and have their say. It’s not just them, Speaker; it’s the parents, who you’ve yet to listen to, who are facing a limiting of their options and an associated major hike in fees once this legislation is put into place.", "When I spoke to this bill in the previous session, I mentioned my own personal experience with day care decisions. I told you about my young son Murphy, who is at the J.W. Gerth YMCA—and I really can’t say enough about the good work they do down there. It wasn’t an easy decision for us on where to put Murphy; it isn’t for any parent. You’re entrusting others with the care and protection of your child, and that’s a difficult choice to make, but for most of us, it’s a choice that we have to make. When we do so, it’s important that we have the information we need to make that choice, and the assurance from government that it will be responsive and active, should concerns arise or enforcement become necessary. Again, that hasn’t been the case, of course, with the local YMCA. We and Murphy have had a great experience and look forward to his brother Lincoln following him in the coming months. Of course, we do have to send Lincoln in December to a home care provider to bridge that gap between 12 months and 18 months, when the YMCA can take him. The other option, obviously, was to bring him to a smaller in-home day care in the neighbourhood with a family member or friend.", "In a way we were lucky to have a number of options when it came to our child’s care so that we could weigh the plusses and minuses and come up with a decision that best fits our needs. Of course, that decision, again, was the YMCA, and we’ve never looked back.", "But there is a concern, and we’ve all seen it in our emails, during constituency meetings and in our local papers. There is a concern that many, specifically in our rural communities, won’t have these options if this legislation is passed in its current form. The concern is that many unlicensed day cares would be shut down and parents would be forced to look further afield and at much more expensive options that may be completely unaffordable. What then, Speaker? Well, I’ll tell them what then. The parent, now facing limited and unaffordable day care options, seeks out care that this legislation has driven underground, only adding to the problems caused by the current lack of oversight and enforcement, setting the stage for further tragedy.", "I think many of the concerns raised by the current writing of the bill could be dealt with if the government was prepared to engage in real consultation with parents, of course, and with the providers to ensure a well-thought-out and workable bill that maintains child care options while ensuring the safety and well-being of our children.", "I’ll leave it at that, and I hope to finish my remarks in the two minutes subsequent." ],

I really hope that the government was listening, because when it comes to inspections and when it comes to ensuring our children’s safety, I’m not exactly sure that Bill 10 meets those needs.", "The member spoke of four children dying within a seven-month period. That was due to the lack of consistency in inspections and making sure that our children were safe. The government heard complaints and the ministry had complaints regarding these providers, and yet they failed to act on those investigations. I believe that by the end of 2013 we had only 54 inspectors. They’re planning on adding only six to that list. Yes, they will be specialized inspectors, but the inspectors that were currently there were not able to keep up with the job. The Ombudsman completely uncovered that, talking about the lack of tools to be able to enforce that, to make sure that we were acting on those complaints. If they had acted on the complaints, we would have saved children’s lives.", "I think it’s absolutely critical that we make sure we get it right when we come to committee for Bill 10. Six inspectors isn’t going to cover it. We need to make sure that they’re putting proper funds into the enforcement levels of our child care sector.", "It’s absolutely critical that we get it right.

That’s a 90% increase. This is a government that takes child care very seriously. Licensed child care capacity has grown by nearly 90,000 spaces since 2003, and that includes more than 22,000 new licensed, non-profit child care spaces since 2005. When we talk about the availability of child care options, I think this demonstrates that this government is committed to increasing those options and that those options have been increased in the licensed sector. That’s why we also introduced the Child Care Modernization Act. If passed, it would modernize child care.", "I would like to highlight that the Office of the Ombudsman undertook a comprehensive review into how the ministry responds to complaints about unlicensed child care providers. The recommendations put forth by the Ombudsman are helpful advice and have informed this legislation. That’s why we introduced the Child Care Modernization Act. If passed, the legislation would expand the Ministry of Education’s powers to support compliance and strengthen oversight of unlicensed child care settings, again in the spirit of making sure that we ensure our children’s safety.", "The last thing I would say is that the regulatory changes that we are proposing are as a result of extensive consultation with our partners in the child care sector.

It has not been talked about with those independent child care operators. What my colleagues have brought up is, there’s an awful lot of opportunity here to do things for the benefit and safety of children. We’re concerned that there are going to be very limited options available on behalf of kids, parents and those child care operators—very few affordable options.", "The Association of Day Care Operators of Ontario has raised concerns to the Ombudsman with regard to the report that was released. They’re urging “further caution from the government and legislators on arbitrary passage of Bill 10 … without further consultation on its long-term impact.” They have very specific concerns about what could be happening. It’s not going to prevent illegal daycare centres from operating, but it “could push many licensed child care centres into closing, thus eliminating much-needed, compliant and safe child care spaces.”", "Their concerns are that it could force the closure of licensed child care centres that have been serving their communities for decades; give government officials the ability to revoke a child care centre’s licence without due process and with no real way to appeal the decision; prevent new licensed child care centres from opening; reduce the choices parents have—my colleague from Kitchener–Conestoga referenced that with his own children—about what’s best for their children; it will do little to address the problems around unlicensed daycares; and could result in 140,000 fewer child care spaces.", "The minister has said, “Trust me.” Sadly, after gas plant fiascos, wind turbines and Ornge issues that we’ve faced with this government, “trust me” is a little thin at this point, particularly when we’re talking about our greatest asset, our most cherished, prized asset: our children, the future of our great country and our province.", "What are they afraid of about going out and talking to the community? Some of the members have suggested that this is a dog-and-pony show, which is totally inaccurate. We need to be out there consulting, listening and doing what’s in the best interests of our children." ],

This is something that, absolutely, as legislators and as a province, we need to act on. We need to address it and make sure no family has to suffer the enormous grief that would happen in those kinds of circumstances.", "Our concern with this bill is that it doesn’t really address that issue. The bill doesn’t address the fact that the ministry has been unable to respond to complaints that are lodged about overcrowded and unlicensed daycares. We know that the ministry did not respond to 25 of the 448 complaints that were launched in the 18-month period before little Eva died. We are very concerned that the bill does not augment the inspection capacity of the ministry to the level that is necessary to respond to these concerns as they are reported by the ministry." ],

I will be sharing my time with my colleague from James Bay.", "Child care, as we know, is key to the safety and well-being of children across this province and is a crucial piece to having a strong and robust economy. Child care is one of the most significant pressures facing young families, and parents are often left worrying about having access to care, the high cost of care and, of course, the safety of their children while they are being cared for.", "According to the Ontario Ombudsman, there are 1.8 million children in Ontario aged 12 and under. He estimates that 396,000 of them are enrolled in licensed child care and 823,000 are enrolled in unlicensed child care.", "He goes on to state that in 2012 there were 274 complaints received by the Ministry of Education about unlicensed child care, and in 2013 that number jumped significantly to 526 reports of concerns.", "There are a number of problems with child care and how it’s delivered in Ontario. We’ve all been made aware in this House and across the province of the very unfortunate situation of the deaths that we’ve had while children have been in care. When we last debated this bill, when it was being debated under the number of Bill 143 this past spring, at that time we had had four kids who had died in unlicensed child care in the past seven months. This, of course, prompted us to contact the Ontario Ombudsman to investigate the delivery of child care in the province. His report was just released on October 22 of this year.", "It was really quite a scathing report. In his remarks he made during the release of his report, he stated that presently there is only one rule: Unlicensed operators can’t care for more than five unrelated children under the age of 10, not counting their own children. Other than that, anyone can set themselves up as a daycare without requiring a licence or meeting any standards or qualifications.", "He went on to state: “As lax as the rules are for unlicensed daycares, they were barely being enforced by a bureaucracy that shied away from inspections and investigations and preferred to use soft tools of encouragement instead….", "“Many of the problems date back years, but were compounded in 2012 by a botched transition of the daycare system from the Ministry of Children and Youth Services to the Ministry of Education, which took it on along with the government’s full-day kindergarten” initiative.", "He went on to talk about some of the other key findings, along with the systemic problems that the Ombudsman identified in his report." ],

If you could just give me another six minutes, I would certainly appreciate it.", "Along with the systemic problems the Ombudsman identifies in this report, he mentions sloppy, inconsistent complaint intake practices and an inadequate complaint tracking system. He mentions that ministry guidelines are not being followed, inspections are delayed or never done, and that staff is untrained in conducting investigations or on the legislation they enforce. Again, this is awful stuff. There are poor inspection practices, careless evidence gathering, and the failure to involve or educate parents about daycare standards and facilities that are not in compliance with them. Again, a very scathing report.", "This bill is widely regarded as the government’s attempt to overhaul child care legislation to both stabilize the sector following the implementation of full-day kindergarten and address concerns over safety and oversight of unlicensed child care.", "It repeals the Day Nurseries Act, which was implemented in 1946. I don’t think anyone can argue that it’s definitely in need of a review. It does a number of other things. I just wanted to quickly mention some of those other changes that it seeks.", "It seeks to establish a duty for unlicensed child care providers to disclose to parents that they are unregulated, and to keep a record of this disclosure. Receipts must be provided free of charge to parents.", "It creates a duty for employees to report imminent threats to the health and safety of the children in care. It outlines powers for inspectors, but as the member from Hamilton Mountain mentioned, despite the regulation and the clarifying of some of the standards, there aren’t enough inspectors to go around the province to actually enforce some of these things.", "It goes on to prohibit individuals from providing care if they’ve been convicted of offences under the act. It allows licensed home child care providers to care for up to six children, two of whom can be under two years of age, or up to 12 kids, including four under age two, if two adults are working together. It goes on to amend the Education Act to require school boards to provide or have a third party provide extended day programming for students up to grade 6 on all regular school days. Those are some of the big changes: again, the larger group sizes, as well as those extended day programs that will have to be offered by schools.", "The fact is, though, that, for years this Liberal government has been underfunding child care, leaving municipalities to pick up the tab just to maintain some of their existing services. Some of the key problems are the lack of spaces and the long wait-lists for subsidized spaces. There is a regulated full- or part-time centre-based space for only 20% of children in Ontario under age five. As of 2012, Ontario had 4,922 licensed child care centres with only 276,000 spaces. What’s most glaring is the lack of infant spaces, and that’s really the greatest challenge. We have at least 98,000 infants competing for just 10,000 licensed infant spaces each year. So we have 10 infants and only one space. That’s that ratio, and that’s horrible.", "The bottom line is that we need to ensure that families have access to affordable, safe, regulated child care, that the enforcement has teeth and is effective. We need increased oversight and regulation. We need to address the fundamental problem of underfunding, and ultimately we need to commit to building a system of licensed, not-for-profit, affordable child care that meets the needs of families. This is an initiative that my federal NDP counterparts have taken up. They propose to deliver a $15-a-day national child care program that is much needed across the country.", "In Ontario, we have an opportunity to take the lead. We are looking at some fairly significant changes here, and these changes don’t go far enough. In Ontario, child care can cost families $70 to $80 per day, and that’s about $20,000 per year. I know, especially in northwestern Ontario, the wages aren’t such that we could support that. In Ontario, we pay the highest rates in the country. Again, Ontario should be taking a lead role and use this opportunity to shape something that will help Ontarians now.", "My concern in Kenora–Rainy River is that there’s already a large and very serious shortage of child care spaces. As I mentioned, Bill 143 is the first broad examination of child care legislation that we’ve seen in close to 30 years, but despite that, I disagree with the minister’s remarks that she made on October 22. When she was doing her lead, she referred to this bill as “comprehensive” and as having woven together “all the strands” relevant to this issue.", "I think there are some very important concerns that have been raised that need to be considered, such as an adequate number of inspectors, addressing negligence in care, ensuring that those who provide the bulk of our care, i.e., the unlicensed care, are able to do so in a way that is regulated and safe for children, but also continues to enable and allow home-based child care providers to continue to bring this important source of income home every night.", "So rushing through this, especially through a time allocation motion, is a very huge mistake. There are already very real and valid concerns that need to be addressed, including the most serious of all, and those are deaths in our system. We need to take the time to hear those concerns from all across this province, not just here in Toronto, as has been mentioned by other members. We need to bring this to committee, travel with the committee and make sure that we are hearing from people again across the province.", "I’m hearing concerns in my riding like from a woman by the name of Helena who thinks that this is just outrageous. She thought it was outrageous that we were going full steam ahead back in the spring, but now I can only imagine how upsetting this is. She said, “They are trying to pass this, and it can’t happen. It was hard enough to find child care in Fort Frances and now they want to introduce this bill? Yes, something needs to be done, but this is not the answer to the problem.” We need to make sure, of course, that these voices are being heard.", "If this passes as is, we will likely lose child care spots in the north—and again, we already have a critical shortage.", "It is incumbent upon us to recognize that new isn’t necessarily better or perfect. We have to take our time and we have to get it right, because families across this province are trusting us with their most precious and valuable assets. We owe it to them to review this legislation carefully and ensure that no other children are lost while being cared for." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. This is a perfectly good Liberal bill for Liberals, I must say, because Liberals really have got a knack for being able to say one thing in a bill and making it look as if they’re doing something great, wonderful, the best in the world, the best in the universe, the best of all time, but not doing anything to really advance the needs of citizens in our communities from one end of this province to the other.", "The government purports, by way of this bill, to fix a problem that’s in daycare. Agreed. I think there are some regulatory changes that have to be done that are mentioned in the bill in order to deal with some of the tragedies that we’ve seen at unlicensed, unregulated daycares across this province. But I’ve just got to say that this bill is not going to do a heck of a lot for creating daycare spaces outside of this place, the Legislature of Ontario. Thank God there are cities like Toronto that are making some investments in daycare in their own municipalities by using provincial dollars—I get it. But the province is not leading when it comes to making sure that across this province there are viable options when it comes to not-for-profit daycare in communities from Kenora to Cornwall and from Sarnia all the way up to Moosonee. We don’t have those options.", "I just have to say that this is perfect, perfect doublespeak on the part of the Liberals when it comes to saying one thing in the title of the bill, making it look as if they’re doing something and they’re being progressive, but what they’re doing is allowing more private daycare in this province and not putting an emphasis on creating not-for-profit daycare spots across this province.", "Thank God the federal NDP proposed, as we did here in Ontario some years ago, that we go to a Quebec-based model. At $15 a day—it was less expensive in Quebec, but those were the days then. The Ontario NDP, under the leadership of Howard Hampton some years ago, suggested that particular idea, put it forward, made it an item going into the Legislature, and unfortunately it was not picked up on. Let’s hope that our federal cousins, the federal New Democrats under Thomas Mulcair, have more success.", "I can tell you, there’s not one person in this Legislature who is not affected by difficulty of access to daycare. I look at my own family. I’ve got four grandchildren. I’ve got two who have gone through the not-for-profit daycare services in the city of Timmins and are now in school. The option of going into the not-for-profit was difficult because there are long waiting lists. There’s a limited number of spaces. If you don’t get a space, and mom and dad have got to work, what are you going to do? You’ve got to go to a private system or you’ve got to go to mémère’s place, or you’ve got to go to the neighbour down the road or an aunt or an uncle or a good friend.", "As for Ellisa, our third granddaughter, she’s still in the daycare system, but again in the private. Why? Because the public has not been an option because it has not been available. Our youngest one was just born a month ago, so it will be a while before she gets into daycare.", "But I would just say that there are not options for parents to opt in for not-for-profit daycare services across this province. If this province and this government were saying, “We’re prepared to move in that direction,” I can tell you, my colleague from Hamilton Mountain and my colleagues from across this caucus would say, “Yes, let’s do it. Let’s look at ways of making the investments that are necessary in a prudent way, within the fiscal realities that we have here in Ontario, to be able to give options to parents to opt in to regulated not-for-profit child care across this province.”", "Kathleen Wynne—I should say the Premier—and the Liberals love to talk the talk: “We’re progressive. We’re open. We do all wonderful things for wonderful people.” But when it comes to actually doing something, they are really helping their friends in the private sector before helping the people they should be helping, which is families across this province trying to access daycare.", "I hearken to a point my colleague from Kenora–Rainy River made, and she’s right. The government is time-allocating this bill, which is a real shame, because it would be beneficial to have this bill as a way to have a discussion on daycare in communities across this province. I wouldn’t argue, as the House leader for the NDP, that it has to go to every community in Ontario, but certainly we can pick a number of communities and we can say, “Let’s find out a snapshot of what is going on in this province, or what’s not going on in this province, when it comes to daycare,” and then bring that back to this Legislature so that we can decide.", "I remember when I first got elected, our government had decided that we would make a pretty massive investment in daycare, so we were investing in and creating not-for-profit daycare centres as options for people across this province. From Cornwall to Kenora, from Sarnia to Moosonee, there was something going on when it came to not-for-profit daycare spots being increased and offered to parents across this province.", "At the time there was an ideological difference between the Conservatives and Liberals against the New Democrat not-for-profit model. Both the Liberals—I think they were showing their true colours back then—along with the Conservatives said that we need to make sure that we create an option in the private sector. My point is this: Dianne Poole, a member of the Liberal caucus at that time, which was the official opposition, had decided that she wanted to put forward, in committee, what was called at that time a standing 123, so that a committee can travel outside of this Legislature to hear from the private sector when it comes to what should happen in the daycare sector. The NDP was not focusing on that at the time because we were focusing our energies and our efforts on making sure that we expanded the not-for-profit sector. We gave her that because we thought it was important to have that discussion. Yes, it was allowed under the standing orders, but the government said: “You know what? This is an important discussion to have across the province, and we should hear from all sides. We should hear from those who want to increase the not-for-profit sector,”—as we did—“but we should also hear from the private sector.”", "I remember hearing from various daycares in my riding, mostly at that time private because it was mostly private daycare in my particular communities, who were really aghast that we weren’t putting money in their pockets and that we were putting it into not-for-profit. We had said, “No, we’re not going to do that. Our investments will go in not-for-profit, and we’ll look at ideas that you may have when it comes to making your lives a little bit easier.”", "So yes, this bill should travel. I think this is a crying shame. We see Kathleen Wynne, the Premier of Ontario, following down the same path as Dalton McGuinty, former Liberal Premier of Ontario, and that is, “We’re going to time-allocate everything in this place. Why? Because we can.” Because it’s too darned hard for them to sit down with the opposition and to figure out an agenda about how we’re able to have certain bills travel to be able to do what needs to be done as far as the scrutiny that’s necessary to make better legislation.", "When I first got elected in this place in 1990, there was no time allocation. Members were allowed to speak as long as they wanted on a bill, and there was no time allocation. What that did is, it forced the opposition and the government to work together to figure out how to get the agenda of the House through. A government has the right to govern. The government has the right to pass their agenda. That’s why they’re a majority government. But a majority government also has to recognize that the responsibility of the opposition is to scrutinize and to give voice to those people out there who may have a different or a similar view of the government when it comes to a particular issue.", "For this government to say that they’re going to time-allocate this bill, as they’re going to be time-allocating every other bill, is a crying shame, because what we’ve got is essentially no scrutiny on what is an important issue for the province of Ontario. We’re not giving, contrary to what the Premier says, voice to the people of this province to come to a legislative committee somewhere in their community, somewhere in Ontario, and speak to the issue of daycare as it relates to them. All a parent knows is not the regulations of what will or will not happen in the private sector daycare system; all a parent knows is, “I can or I can’t get daycare,” or “I can or I can’t afford the daycare that’s being offered to me.” This bill doesn’t speak to that. If we had an opportunity to travel, you would hear that. Maybe the government would then start practising what it preaches and would actually try to do something progressive for the people of this province, rather than yet again having a title of a bill that says something nice but, at the end of the day, helping your private sector friends and forgetting that the not-for-profit daycare sector needs your help—something that you haven’t done for a while, and something that sorely needs your attention." ],

For the last four years, we have experienced all the trials and tribulations of trying to navigate the child care system in this province, seeking out care for an infant, seeking out care before kindergarten and now, before- and after-school programs. To me, this is really landmark legislation. It’s a badly needed overhaul of a system that hasn’t really been properly looked at in decades. It’s going to put some badly needed teeth into the enforcement around unlicensed daycares to prevent some of the horrific tragedies that have occurred. Any parent or grandparent, or human being in this Legislature, will do anything they can to prevent that from happening again.", "I’m also very heartened by the fact that there will be tools put in place through this legislation that make it easier for parents to get good information, through an online tool, about the daycare that’s available. That’s something my wife and I had the privilege of using in our community, because that was available. Now it will be available province-wide. It’s very important for parents to be able to find information about the daycare that’s available in their community.", "I think it’s also extremely important that before- and after-school programs are now going to be expanded—a key part of the child care services we need in this province—and that this government is responding to the Ombudsman’s recommendations and enacting legislation to give force and effect to the recommendations of the Ombudsman." ],

The ministry brags about their program of consultation. But the people who look after about 75% of the children, from infant to 12 years of age, have not been consulted.

They’ve absolutely got to find out about this, because it’s going to have a negative impact not only on the young people—the daycare spaces that are not there for them—but on the pocketbooks of all those moms out there who are helping babysit a couple of kids. That will have a negative impact. The government seems to ignore that, and what the economic downside of that will be.", "So, we won’t stop on this. I can’t believe they would even consider time-allocating this. But believe me: I’ve seen them do a lot of worse things.

They’re trying to pretend that they’re doing something that’s really going to be ground-moving when it comes to giving parents the ability and the option to choose a daycare centre somewhere near the spot where they happen to live, that allows them to have some kind of option.", "But we all know what has happened with this Liberal government. They have done almost nothing when it comes to supporting—they don’t have a not-for-profit daycare strategy in this province. The city of Toronto has done so and has made some investments—why?—because the province has given them some money. But this province, this government, has not put in place a policy of trying to find a way to shore up and expand the not-for-profit sector.", "We know that it’s an issue because, in communities across Ontario, every member in this House—be it a parent, a grandparent, an aunt, an uncle or the neighbour of a child—knows of somebody who has had a struggle to find access to, first of all, a regulated daycare spot, but, more importantly, a not-for-profit daycare spot, because those spots are used up pretty quickly because there are not a lot of them out there.", "Again it’s a question of doublespeak on the part of the Premier. The Premier and the Liberals are notorious for saying one thing in the title and doing something completely different in the actual details of the bill. The title is great. You’re going to do something in order to fix the lack of regulation in the unregulated daycare sector. Fine; we don’t have a problem with that. But this is not going to give parents from Kenora to Cornwall, from Sarnia to Moosonee, the additional options of being able to find a place to get their child or their grandchild to when it comes to a regulated daycare spot somewhere in this province." ],

I mean, it was such a slap in the face to the people of this province who are struggling day in and day out.", "Bill 8, under the reflective schedule, does not commit to a hard cap. It does not clearly indicate which executives in the broader public service would fall under the purview of this legislation. It is purely window dressing and public pressure, and yet it’s contained within a piece of legislation which has some important pieces around accountability. But it doesn’t have the teeth, it doesn’t have the mechanisms in place to actually, truly be accountable—in fact, even transparent.", "One of the issues that for us is completely and utterly non-negotiable is the integrity of the so-called patient ombudsman.

Why bring forward a piece of legislation which does not accomplish the goals for which it was set out? Last Thursday—and I’m going to give you a very quick overview. There are 14 very good reasons why the patient ombudsman, as illustrated in this piece of legislation, will be ineffective.", "Very quickly, it’s appointed by cabinet and not the Legislature. The ombudsman, as portrayed in this legislation, is not an officer of the Legislature; instead, the patient ombudsman will be an employee of the health quality council. I want to interject very quickly, because I saw this great quote from the Ombudsman who said—in fact, the Ombudsman has fired something of a shot across the bow. He welcomed the creation of the patient ombudsman while emphasizing that his office has oversight over the Ontario Health Quality Council who, in turn, have the responsibility for the creation of the patient ombudsman. He would be all over the new ombudsman’s mandate “like a dirty shirt,” and we wish him well in that. But it shouldn’t come to that. You shouldn’t have the Ombudsman having to watch very closely the goings-on of the patient ombudsman when there are so many issues in the health portfolio in the province of Ontario.", "Just last week, thank goodness, the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario, the midwives of Ontario and the Canadian federation of doctors came here and said that medical tourism is a huge issue in this province, and yet there’s no plan in place. The Minister of Health stands up and says that it’s just not true. You can say anything, I guess, you want in this place and say it’s not true, but we have evidence to counter that.", "But going back to the patient ombudsman and why the proposal is so weak: As I said, it’s appointed by cabinet; not an officer of the Legislature; no set term of office, so that if this patient ombudsman becomes too critical of the government of the day, then that term could be closed down. Cabinet is authorized to revoke the patient ombudsman appointment at any time. So do we really expect the patient ombudsman to be critical of the government? “Boom,” you know, “too critical. Bye. You don’t have a job.” It would be great if we didn’t have examples of that already happening, but we do.", "Not explicitly forbidden from holding other employment: We’re actually saying in legislation that the patient ombudsman for the province of Ontario—this doesn’t have to be their sole responsibility.

My colleagues have already spoken at length about Ornge, and quite comprehensively—but this is an issue with this new, proposed ombudsman. They can’t go into a retirement home. If you’ve been asleep for the last 10 years, you will have missed the fact that there are huge tensions in the retirement homes in the province of Ontario and that conflict has happened because you have children who have placed their parents at various stages of need and of care into retirement homes. If those retirement homes are driven by a profit agenda, then what they have been promised at the outset is not what is delivered in that for-profit home. You’ve seen dietary requirements not met. You have seen hygiene requirements not met. They have been promised this compassionate and loving setting, and when the children of the parents who are in that home come into that setting, they see anything but a caring and compassionate place.", "These are seniors who have built this province, and yet this patient ombudsman is not able to go into those settings and ensure that there is a level of quality of service, a level of dignity, a level of integrity. It’s really quite something.", "They also cannot go into homes for special care or out-of-hospital premises like private clinics. We’ve just heard this morning that there has been a 31% increase in private clinics in the province of Ontario. We just heard this morning that one out of every seven of those clinics falls well below the standards of care that we would expect. So if there was ever a reason to have someone be able to have that oversight to go into those clinics, it would be now, especially with the accelerated privatization agenda of this Liberal government. Now they’re not even being sneaky about it. Now, they’re just saying, “You know what? We’re not going to support public health care anymore in a comprehensive, transparent, accountable way. We’re just going to let it come in on the side.”", "It’s like Scopes “R” Us in the parking lot. If you need a colonoscopy and you can’t get into a hospital because their hospital budgets have been cut—they’ve been flatlined now for three years, which is essentially a cut. Now, if you can’t get a colonoscopy—you have a family history and you are scared, and with an aging demographic, this is not an inconceivable situation—you can go to one of these private clinics, where the evidence shows that those colonoscopies are done faster, with less oversight, without the precautionary medical oversight put in place. And some of those patients end up in public care anyway because the private clinic did such a shoddy job.", "This patient ombudsman can’t investigate that. But that’s okay by the Liberal government. You’ve put something into place, and you take your chances. It’s like Russian roulette in the private health care system for the people of this province.", "The patient ombudsman will need to facilitate co-operation amongst patients and health care sectors. In contrast, the provincial Ombudsman compels co-operation from government organizations because the Ombudsman Act has real teeth. This person does not. This person does not have the power to do the job that you are selling to the people of this province.", "Finally, the ombudsman is not allowed to make recommendations to the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. Really; this is actually in the act. The ombudsman cannot make recommendations to the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care following the conclusions of any investigation. It can only make recommendations to hospitals and CCACs and long-term-care homes.", "So all this person can do is put a band-aid on a little problem. But those little problems become big problems for the broader public health care system because if you try to save money right now by offering a very quick, for-profit medical treatment service and that person develops complications—as the research shows that they will do—then they end up in the public health care system, and it costs us more. Privatization is not good value for the people of this province. In fact, it costs more. It compromises the entire goal of a public health care system.", "I think last Thursday I went on at length about how strongly I feel about the lack of oversight for the patient ombudsman. There are advocates in hospitals. They do very good work. They try to mitigate some of the damage that has actually happened because it’s a patchwork system of health care in some places. And people need advocates because it’s a complicated system; it’s actually not very simple for people to use.", "Those were the areas that I focused on: the non-existent oversight and public sector pay caps—the no cap, pay cap piece of this legislation; and the lack of power to actually have a patient ombudsman who could actually serve the people of this province. I thought I saw some people listening at the time, but I could be wrong, for sure.", "Today, I want to focus on the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth. There hasn’t been too much mention about this. A lot of people may not know how important the provincial advocate is for children in the province of Ontario.", "I had the distinct pleasure of having some dealings with this office when I was president of the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association, particularly on First Nation, Métis and Inuit youth issues, certainly in my role at the school board, when I was fighting for greater resources for students with special needs. School boards are struggling. This is a reality. They’re struggling in the north, they’re struggling in the rural areas, and they’re struggling in the inner cities to deal with special-needs students in the education system.", "I first came to actually know the provincial advocate when I was dealing with a brave young woman named Shannon Koostachin. She was fighting for a school in Attawapiskat. The member for that riding, Charlie Angus, read something that I’d written in the Toronto Star, and he reached out, and we pulled the Ontario Catholic Teachers Association, the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Association, ETFO—we pulled the non-First-Nations education advocates into the fold, into the circle. We raised our voices collectively to fight for a stronger and equal education system for First Nation, Métis, and Inuit students.", "We were largely successful in shaming the federal government into doing what they said they were going to do. If you ever have the great misfortune of actually having to deal with what is now—it was INAC; now it’s aboriginal and northern affairs—if you ever have the great misfortune of having to deal with that level of government on an issue that’s so laden with discrimination and racism on issues of equal rights of education for First Nations children in this country, it’s an experience that actually changes you; it really does. So we reached out, of course, to the provincial advocate, because all children fall under the purview of the provincial advocate. Quite honestly, they have done some very good work in moving forward an inclusive agenda to ensure that all voices are heard on this issue.", "Some people have said to me, “What are you going to talk about today?” I said, “I really want to talk about the advocate for children.” They said, “Well, you’re a finance critic; you’re a Treasury Board critic. Maybe focus more on the money.” You know, there are lots of opportunities to focus on the money and how this piece of legislation, which is not transparent, which is not accountable, will affect the final dollar. But you can also make a really good case, both a social policy case and an economic case, for offering equal opportunity for children in this province, to offer compassionate care, to offer caring opportunities, be they with the CAS, with school boards, with health care or with nutrition. You can make a good financial case for doing the right thing early in the life of a child, so that you actually don’t have to spend much more down the line. It’s the upstream philosophy. It’s not a philosophy this government particularly believes in, but it’s something that I feel strongly about.", "Bill 8 has, under schedule 10, the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth—or lack of powers relative to other provincial children’s advocates. This is the issue at play: Other provincial advocates in this country have certain powers where they can protect children; unfortunately, in the province of Ontario, the provincial advocate has done a lot of work with very little resources and very little powers.", "Obviously Bill 8 is, as I mentioned, an omnibus bill; it has these 11 schedules contained within it. But prior to Bill 8 coming forward as this somewhat ominous piece of legislation, the provincial advocate weighed in on what was formally Bill 179, Public Sector and MPP Accountability and Transparency Act. I’m just going to read from their report of what they said at that time about this piece of legislation: “While the proposed amendments are an important first step in enhancing safeguards of children or youth in Ontario, they fall short of the protections available to young people in almost every other Canadian province.”", "So, on the broader plan, Ontario, one of the biggest provinces, the province that has the most children, falls short in the grand scheme of things. They go on to say that their concerns about the proposed amendments are threefold. There is a discrepancy between the stated intent of the proposed amendments and the actual powers given to the advocate’s office—this confirms our perspective. The new powers only apply to a select group of children within the mandate—this is obviously problematic. And the proposed powers fall short of what is available to the Ombudsman of Ontario and all the other provincial child advocates offices in Canada in exercising their statutory function.", "Why bring forward a piece of legislation that is not going to meet the goals of protecting children or advocating for children. I mean, where does that fall in the grand scheme of your priorities? I know what the press release says. I know that you’ve packaged this up under the guise of accountability and transparency, but if it doesn’t work, why put it on the floor? Why bring it to your colleagues in this Legislature? It has to be frustrating for some of you over there to see that this schedule, which had its original flaws under Bill 179, is exactly the way it is now under Bill 8.", "Even though the provincial advocate and people from across the province—people with the real lived experiences of not being able to protect children—came forward with amendments, they’re not reflected. So you didn’t take the opportunity to make this schedule under Bill 8 stronger. And I have to question—" ],

Those voices are not to be listened to by the provincial advocate. It’s hard to believe that whoever crafted this piece of legislation would leave out the voices of children.", "We have evidence—and I have this quote on my desk; it’s from page 4 of the throne speech by the Liberal government—that says that you will put evidence above partisanship. Well, I have the evidence. The evidence from the provincial advocate says that he needs to be able to act on the voices of children who have been abused, whose rights have been violated, whose trust has been broken, and yet the provincial advocate has no right to fully investigate systemically.", "You can’t talk about the children’s aid societies in the province of Ontario and not know that that is a system that is broken. We have known this for a long time, which is why we have called for full oversight, all the powers that the Ombudsman would need to correct, to systemically change and rebuild and strengthen a system of caring for children.", "There are good people involved in children’s aid societies across this province; there are very good people. They are so frustrated by the bureaucracy, by the red tape, by the priorities that come from this government because the Liberals have fully embraced a top-down and centralized method of correcting or owning or downloading their philosophies onto everybody, from municipalities to school boards to children’s aid societies to hospitals, for that matter—although they seem very reluctant to weigh in on the medical tourism that hospitals have embraced. But this is an issue that we’re going to continue.", "Aside from highlighting the lack of powers relative to other children’s advocates, Ontario’s advocate remains alone among the country’s provincial children’s advocates in not having the power to compel information from service providers, institutions, governments, and public bodies that pertain to the advocate’s mandate. You might as well just give him a pair of handcuffs and say, “Go out and do your best,” because all advocates in all other provinces in this great country have that power. In Alberta, in British Columbia and in Saskatchewan, the children’s advocates have the ability to review any information that the advocate deems necessary to exercise their powers and perform their duties. The Ontario advocate in the great province of Ontario does not. This continues under this schedule, even though the provincial advocate weighed in and gave constructive criticism and meaningful amendments to what was then Bill 179, but this government has made no efforts whatsoever to change or alter or rebuild this piece of legislation.", "Under the schedule in Bill 8, the children’s advocate is restricted from investigating in any other area of their mandate other than children’s aid societies and licensed homes who have service agreements with the CAS. What does this mean? It means that the children’s advocate cannot look into unlicensed homes, even though we know that they are a growing phenomenon. In Kitchener–Waterloo, because there have been cutbacks, because budgets have been flatlined, there is a growing and emerging trend in unlicensed homes for children. It’s happening in all of your ridings. You could just walk around your neighbourhood and you would likely be able to find one. But this provincial advocate—he or she—cannot go into that home to make sure that those standards are being upheld. What does that say to you about how this government values children? Where do children fall in the grand priority between travelling to China and privatizing and selling off hydro? Where do children fall in the grand scheme of things?", "This Ombudsman says he cannot look into the children’s mental health system. This is the huge issue. Right? There was a 12-year-old little boy who took his life because the system failed him. The children’s advocate should be able to systemically look at every door that was closed in the face of that family. He should be empowered to actually act on behalf of this child who took his own life. Mental health affects every single one of us. The stat is 1 in 5, but when we were advocating for our provincial mental health advocate at the Ontario public school boards, the trickle-out effect of mental health issues in this province—you can argue it from an economic perspective, you can argue it from a financial, an upstream perspective, but really, at the end of the day, we are talking about changing and altering the way that we see well-being: mental health and physical health as one. This culture of well-being that has been talked about for quite some time by this government has been just that—it’s just been talk.", "Just to recap: The advocate cannot look into the children’s mental health system. The youth justice system—I mean, we have been standing in this House and raising these issues about the inequities and the lack of resources when you send youth into an incarcerated justice system. And what happens there? Just as I was elected, one of the first places I went was the jail that Ashley Smith was kept at. The two issues are connected: the justice system and mental health.", "I got a tour of the facility and we talked about a lack of resources. We talked about what the justice system is trying to do in the face of a lack of resources. I saw the cell where Ashley Smith took her own life. It will always be with me. I take it with me everywhere I go because that’s the responsibility that I have as a member of provincial Parliament: to not forget, to not turn away, to not ignore the circumstances that are facing the youth in the province of Ontario. The provincial advocate would probably feel the same way. I’m sure that he does. But this piece of legislation won’t strengthen his position. It won’t empower him to address the systemic issues that face not only the education system but the health care system and the youth justice system. Finally, he’s not even able to advocate for those who are in homes, or services for blind or deaf youth.", "You have to understand the frustration. The frustration is real, because you had an opportunity—even if you wanted to bury it under the guise of public sector and MPP accountability and transparency, you could have actually made it stronger. You could have done the right thing. You could have made sure that the provincial advocate had the resources to actually do his or her job. And it has to be a calling because it must be an exercise in frustration to be in that position, to have that title, and not to have that power.", "I’d just like to summarize: This is a public relations exercise. This essentially is a piece of legislation which the Liberal government is using to squeeze the Conservatives and the NDP and say, “You know what? Look. We’re different now. We’re different. We are going to put these measures into place so you will forget about the exorbitant salaries and the buyouts to the broader public service at the executive level. You’re going to forget about the gas plants, forget about Ornge, forget about the lack of oversight in the health care system.”", "We now have this piece of legislation that pretends that accountability and transparency are actually a priority, when I’ve given evidence to the contrary. I’ve given evidence to the contrary on the broader public sector salaries, on the patient ombudsman and on the provincial children’s advocate. You can’t dispute it. The legislation is weak. It was designed to be weak. It’s designed to be weak with intention, and it doesn’t do what probably many of you on that side of the House want to do. Yet it’s before us. It’s too big a piece of legislation.", "There are accountability measures that we support, of course. Our expenses should be posted. I have no issues with that. We live in the public arena, so parts of our lives are open for everyone to see. We live with that and that is fine. But what we can’t live with, what is not negotiable, is to put forward a piece of legislation which pretends to protect patients in the face of an accelerated privatization agenda on health care and that pretends to protect children when it does not do so.

As a physician, I can tell you that as it is rolled out to the community and more individuals will have access to a complaints mechanism beyond what is existing—whether it is, for example, through the college of physicians and surgeons or the college of family physicians and their various specialty boards, to actually make physical, live, interactive complaints with an individual assigned with regard to hospitals, long-term-care homes and community care access centres—you would think that would be something that the NDP would support.", "I’m not sure if they’re not supporting it because of their commitment, which they may or may not follow through on, of the $600-million further reduction to the budget of Ontario, as was presented not too long ago in the election.

Surely, the government would have consulted with him and with the real Ombudsman before drafting this piece of legislation. Clearly, they haven’t.", "She talked about the omnibus aspect of this bill—more to the point, as she said, the ominous aspect of this bill, because there is some.

I, myself, believe—and many of us know this from our offices—that the thing we can do most immediately to correct a situation, to help a person, to help an individual with a problem that they have, is the best thing for us to do. There are challenges with everything that we do in government.

We’re talking about transparency and accountability because that’s what we do in here. That’s what we do in committee.", "In the interests of disclosing again, my name is on the aggregates report. I, again, came in at report writing time, and I just wanted to make sure that I got that out as well.", "As we were talking about earlier, it also creates a patient ombudsman. We have a large—it’s half of what we do in terms of the money that we spend—very complicated system that involves people. I very strongly believe that it is a unique role. As I said in response to the member from Kitchener–Waterloo, I really believe in the efforts to help individuals with their challenges with government or inside large, complex organizations; it’s very important work.", "As members, we know that we do some of that work right now.

If you have a question, if you have a problem and you don’t know who takes care of it—I don’t care what it is, just call us. We’ll help you figure it out.”", "I believe that a patient ombudsman is a very important step to ensuring that people know where they can go. I know that some hospitals have their own patient advocates, and I think they do good work. I think, however, that it’s important, to have consistency across the system, that we have this patient ombudsman.", "It also expands the role and powers of the Integrity Commissioner not only of course with regard to MPP expenses but also with cabinet ministers, parliamentary assistants, opposition leaders and their respective staff. Until now, cabinet ministers and parliamentary assistants and opposition leaders—all of that was voluntary.

People want a transparent and open government. Going back to my private member’s bill, I believe we have to lead by example and, again, it’s important that that’s in the bill. It will also give her more registrar-like powers over lobbyists. That’s very important. That’s a very big concern in the public domain, that people aren’t seen as having undue influence on the decisions that we make here.", "Of course, it expands the powers of the Ombudsman to school boards, municipalities and publicly assisted universities. The Ombudsman has, of course, graciously accepted and wanted those responsibilities, and I’m pleased that we’re doing that as well too.", "The member from Kitchener–Waterloo was speaking about the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth. I heard her comments—and that’s why we have debate. I look forward to continued debate on this.", "Legislation is something that we all work on together. I know we have differences of opinion, and sometimes when we don’t get our way, then it’s a process. I think the process here has worked for a great number of years, and I look forward to discussing those parts of the bill as we go further in debate.", "Of course, there’s also the broader public sector and developing a framework around executive compensation—a significant problem for us, obviously, as a government that’s looking at financial restraint; making sure that things are fair and equitable and that we have some control over our expenses, especially when it comes to that. It will also require the broader public service and many more agencies to disclose their business plans and other relevant financial information.", "Mr. Speaker, we all come here to represent our communities. I really appreciate all of my colleagues giving me the opportunity to say a few words about my community. It was important, so now I can put that aside, and it’s done. I really do very much appreciate that, and I know it is out of the norm.", "I would like to finish by saying that I really do believe this is an important piece of legislation. I know it has a lot of schedules. I know it covers a lot of government and will require some debate. I do believe it’s more than a public relations exercise, as the member from Kitchener–Waterloo described it.

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I do believe they are relevant from the perspective of transparency and accountability. I believe that transparency and accountability first and foremost are something we have to be front and centre with. We have to show action with our words and we have to ensure that when we stand in front of the people of Ontario, who truly are our court and our judge, we need to be doing that.", "Today, we heard the Premier refusing to hold her Deputy Premier to ministerial standards and seek her resignation over the serious and fatal mismanagement of Ornge. How can you say, “I’m accountable, I’m transparent and I’m going to speak up and be transparent” when they deny those types of things? It certainly is putting to the test the public tolerance for ethical controversy. We need to ensure that if this act is going to be put in, they’re truly going to be more than hollow words, like many pieces of legislation the Liberals have brought forward in my three years, and ensure that this legislation is going to serve the people of Ontario fully.", "I’m going to start off my remarks a little bit by talking about the concern I have that the Treasury Board President has not costed savings or expenditures for this bill. What are the ramifications if this is enacted? What are the impacts going to be for the people of Ontario? What are the fallout ramifications and maybe unintended consequences going to be, as we have so often when these things are rushed out?", "It doesn’t surprise me in some ways. There are 16 actual acts that will be affected by this piece of legislation. It is an omnibus bill. When you have that much legislation being discussed in one bill, trying to be rolled through one bill, it really worries me, particularly with the track record of this Liberal government over the last dozen years on transparency and accountability and the things they have been able to sneak through. They try to put a lot of things into a bill, hoping that, maybe, we aren’t paying attention; we’re not going to catch all the nuances. But that is the job of the opposition and, of course, my colleagues in the third party: to ensure we read every single word of these bills. We think about them and we start to wonder, “What will happen if this is enacted? What are the ramifications? What are the things that are really going to impact the people on the front lines?”", "Mr. Speaker, it concerns me because they’ve done other acts similarly to this, where they’ve rammed them through very quickly and they’ve tried to ensure that the headline sounds good to the people of Ontario without really thinking of what the consequences are and what those implications are going to be down the road. Again, they’ve run a deficit. My colleague from Haldimand–Norfolk just referenced that by the end of this term, they will have a deficit and a debt of $411 billion. I’m very concerned that a bill like this may be adding to that burden. What is going to be the cost to the taxpayers of Ontario who are paying the freight for all of us?", "One of the concerns we have on this side that I need to have addressed before I would ever be able to vote in good conscience is that it’s likely that they are going to actually expand the bureaucracy, and another tower is going to be set up in a silo that is going to be unto itself, building another fiefdom. We see that way too often. We have concerns that there are towers being built in isolation that are building more and more jobs to shuffle paper.", "The people of Ontario deserve front-line care and services; we’re seeing less and less. In my great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, we’re seeing less and less. Just a week ago, I stood in this House and shared with the people of Ontario that 60 people had their hydro disconnected just before we head into the winter season. That’s deplorable.", "Part of that is because of the billions of dollars this government has wasted and continues to waste on scandals and things that are not providing benefit to the people of Ontario. When I see legislation like this talking about creating yet another whole bureaucracy, it worries me—not that there isn’t merit in some of the pieces that they want, but is there not a way we can do it with the existing public service? Is there not a way we can do it without creating yet another whole office of this magnitude that may, at the end of the day, truly force more paper shuffling and more accountability from the report writing? Businesses out there are telling me every day that the Liberal government has put in tremendous amounts of bureaucracy—unintended, uncontrollable legislation that is really preventing them from doing their jobs.", "I want to make sure I stress in all of this that ethics cannot be legislated. Just because someone says, “I have a piece of paper and a document” does not mean that people are going to do the right thing, or do what is in the best interests of the people of Ontario. So I’m a little concerned that by just saying we’re going to put in this act—which again, from what I said earlier, is actually going to have an effect on 16 different pieces of existing legislation—that our world is going to be solved. I think what we want to see is action from this side of the House. We want to ensure that the government actually stands up and walks the talk, truly, to do that. The Liberals have put accountability measures in place before and still, just as recently as the last couple of weeks again—we’ve experienced eHealth, Ornge, gas plants, and now the MaRS scandal. Putting a document in place isn’t necessarily going to do that.", "I will give them credit for trying to bring pieces of legislation through, if they’re going to actually start to address some of those concerns. But we need to ensure that the actual legislation, at the end of the day, is fulsome, has had good debate and had a lot of input.", "My colleague Garfield Dunlop from Simcoe North appeared earlier about Bill 10, the Child Care Modernization Act, for which they’ve actually taken the ability to debate away from us. They’re not going to go out and tour the province, they’re not going to ensure that the people of Ontario have a say, yet they’re talking transparency. I’m a little conflicted. A little bit of hypocrisy, I believe, comes into my mind when I hear them talking about transparency and accountability, and they won’t do those types of things.", "There are 16 acts, which they’re trying to put into one, that are going to be impacted. How do we make sure that those acts are not going to have unintended consequences? There is a schedule within the act, amendments to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act and the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. It says that the bill will ensure that there are measures in place to preserve the records in their institution in accordance with applicable laws, rules and policies. The second point of that schedule says that concealing, destroying or altering a record with the intention of denying the right under the act will be an offence.", "I laud the intent, but it’s a little challenging for me to really take it to heart when this government destroyed records under the gas plants scandal.", "I have to put it on the record one more time: We, as the opposition, tried to bring Peter Faist and Laura Miller to the committee to be able to bring the true facts to the people of Ontario so we could truly get to the bottom of that. That is something we should still be debating in this House, as opposed to bringing in new legislation to try to address what they have not addressed, and that truly is their own backyard, their own accountability and transparency.", "It saddens me that we would actually—I’ve sat through, seen that there were documents destroyed. That’s unprecedented in the history of our great province. Again, a piece of legislation isn’t going to stop that. Doing the right thing, having leadership that actually admonishes that and actually takes action to ensure that that will not happen and that if it does, takes action to ensure that the people who were involved actually have punishment provided to them—that is a way to deter this happening in the future.", "A piece of legislation is only that. It’s only a piece of paper that people can read and choose whether they’re going to actually abide by. You shouldn’t need legislation for things like that. It’s a sad day in Ontario that—again, we tried to push that on behalf of the opposition. That is our role, on behalf of the people of Ontario: to get to the truth to ensure that the people who are going to be impacted most by that billion-dollar boondoggle—that billion dollars that was wasted that’s not going to the front line of health care, that’s not going to the front line of education, that’s not going to the front line of the social services sector that I represent as a critic.", "Almost on a weekly basis, I have people in to my office who are concerned with the programs and services that they’re not getting. Just last week in the riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, I was advised that our victims services are going to be cut a significant amount, and yet they’re mandated to provide that service. They’ve actually increased the fees to the victim services fund, yet there’s less money coming to ridings like Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound and a lot of my colleagues’ across the province.", "So it’s a little bit hard, when I see legislation, to really, truly believe they’re doing it with all of the best intent. The words ring hollow because of the actions that I’ve lived through in my three years here in this great Legislature.", "Another schedule in there is the amendments to the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth Act, 2007. It says in here, “The Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth Act, 2007, is amended to add new investigative powers to the advocate. The advocate would be able to appoint a director of investigations.", "“After the investigation, the advocate would make a report, provide the report to the person or organization it makes recommendations to, make the report public and, in some cases, send a copy to the Premier and make a report to the Legislative Assembly.”", "I’m concerned why that would be “in some cases.” The Premier is the leader. That person should be getting every report—they should—so that they can’t say, “Oh, I didn’t know. It didn’t come through my office.” I can’t understand why that would be put in there, this “in some cases.”", "I certainly would want to hear a lot more dialogue on what that means. I can’t believe that a report of that nature, that is talking about children and youth, the vulnerability and the lack of things they may be receiving if we are not doing our jobs as well as we can, would not come to this Legislature. That is what we’re here for. We are elected to represent the people, to ensure that we’re looking at legislation that is going to benefit all the great people of Ontario, particularly our children and youth.", "Those pages who sit in front of you and across this great Legislature and have the opportunity to come and serve—it’s been great to have them here, by the way; I’m sad that it’s their last week. I’m going to miss all of them. They’ve done a wonderful job here in the Legislature, as have all the pages in my time of three years, providing great service. I think it’s a great experience for them to witness and be part of democracy. And who knows? Many of them may be sitting in these seats a few short years away.", "I really have a question. I can’t understand why you would put in “and in some cases.” That says to me that you’re not truly wanting to be fully open and transparent, because perhaps you’re going to choose which ones actually get to the Premier and perhaps to the Legislature and perhaps, by that very virtue, to the public. It hearkens back again to why the gas plants have been covered up, why that information has not been truly delivered in front of us. Things in the Ornge report: Again, I’m concerned that we’re just trying to move on from there and pretend it didn’t happen. We’ve put a lot of actions in place and the world is rosy now. Well, it’s not, Mr. Speaker. Four people lost their lives.", "My former colleague Frank Klees and I spoke on the weekend in regard to the Ornge report. Again, we talked about transparency and accountability, and the concern we share is that if the government does not take that report and truly put actions in place, they are absolving themselves from the true concern that is there—every transfer agency there. If we don’t implement the reports that were, by the way, all-committee reports—that’s where that report came from. All the committee unanimously supported that. If this government does not step up and do the honourable thing, do the right thing and implement those recommendations, there’s nothing stopping Ornges from happening continuously across this great province, again to the detriment of our society and to those front-line services I hold near and dear.", "I hope the folks at home and here in the Legislature, particularly the Liberals, are listening, to understand that we do have some concerns with parts of this legislation from that perspective. We need open and transparent communication so we can actually understand what that truly means. It really baffles me that you would say, “In some cases, we’ll need to bring it to the Premier, and in some cases, we’ll need to bring it to the Legislature.” All of those types of things, particularly work that’s done on behalf of children and youth by the provincial advocate—I believe, in my former critic role, I had a great opportunity to learn more about the role of the provincial advocate and what they do in their mandate to serve the children and youth of our province. It’s great to see them able to have that ability and be even more hands on, if you will, in protecting our children and youth. But I think we need to understand why it would not be that every single incident should be going to—so the Premier cannot say, “It never got to me. I didn’t know about it.” We’ve heard that on the gas plants: “Well, it didn’t personally get to me.” Well, you were in cabinet. “It didn’t get to me, personally, as Premier.” Well, it came through your office.", "In the Ornge concerns that I raised this morning, a number of things were brought to the Minister of Health and her senior bureaucrats, to her ministry, and again turned a blind eye to, and they hide behind that by saying, “Well, I didn’t see that letter. I didn’t read that report.” That’s your job. As a cabinet minister, you have to be responsible. Whether you saw it or not, it’s your ministry that has to be responsible.", "Speaker, I’m going to move on to another one, the amendments to the public sector expense review. The bill is a compilation of amendments aimed at broadly increasing transparency. It increases the ability of the government to investigate the broader public service. The bill addresses the production of government records and documents to address the deletion of emails in the former Premier’s office. There is an indictment that at least they’ve acknowledged what we’ve been saying all along, as the opposition, that this gas plant scandal, the worst in our province’s history, unless MaRS becomes even worse—it’s in a long line. We had eHealth, we had Ornge, we’ve got the gas plants. But what we’re concerned with is that there were deletions.", "The OPP, I believe, are still investigating that. I think that at some point what we, as the opposition, will be doing is asking for a status update from the OPP to see just where that—again, we don’t want that to just kind of get swept under the rug. I believe many people on the opposite side are hoping this thing just goes away; they need to move on. They’re trying to bring other bills in to take that off the forefront, Mr. Speaker, and we’re not going to allow that. Because the people in my riding certainly ask me continually, “Whatever happened with that? Did we ever get to the truth? Did we really find out how that happened?” And equally importantly—not more importantly, but equally importantly—what are we doing to address that that can never happen again?", "People in my riding, regardless of their political stripe, have said to me, “Bill, I can’t believe that the government would actually delete information of such critical importance and there have been no repercussions.” I don’t believe anyone has lost a job over it. I don’t believe anyone has even really been called on the carpet. I certainly do not believe, from anything I have been able to see in the House, that there has even been anything put in to ensure that that’s prevented. Really, no one on that side of the House has truly stepped up and even said, “Sorry,” to the people of Ontario. “We made an error—someone in our employ did.”", "Again, we have been trying to get Laura Miller and Peter Faist, the two people we believe have the most hands-on, pertinent knowledge of that whole issue, to come forward and, under oath, tell us truly what happened. The only way we can put measures in place to ensure those types of things and that we truly have accountability and transparency is to bring those people in who have the knowledge, those people who were part of that process, those people who can tell us the absolute, undivided truth with no spin involved, no political machinations, to tell us what happened so that we can put measures in place. That’s the job that we, as opposition and the third party, I believe, are entrusted by the people of Ontario to do.", "Mr. Speaker, I can tell you, on behalf of my colleagues in the PC caucus, that we will not let this go. We will not let it be swept under the rug, because $1 billion was wasted that is not going to front-line care, to those people who need social services. As I said earlier, because of the energy rates that are the highest in North America under this government—they’ve allowed our rates to escalate—they’re driving manufacturing out of our province. We’ve lost 300,000 jobs. We’re losing more and more businesses. The rates just went up again, increased on the Saturday of this past weekend, making them the highest rates in this great continent of North America.", "When we’re talking about accountability and transparency, we need to really be able to believe that the party opposite is truly going to make a change. Right now, they’re still going down the same path. They’re not acknowledging the Green Energy Act. Transparency and accountability come up there. They’ve taken away the ability for local municipalities, like those in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound and across most of rural Ontario, to say, “We want a say. We don’t want those turbines in our area.” They have no right or ability, and the government just keeps snowplowing right past them and expediting to ensure that there’s more of that.", "When I hear the words “transparency and accountability act” from members opposite, I really have to challenge whether they’re truly going to make a change, whether they’re truly going to make a difference. I say it over and over again: A piece of legislation and a piece of paper do not change how people act; the principles they abide by—standing up under their leadership and saying, “We will address this. We will make people accountable. We will make sure that everything that happens is transparent and we can see it.”", "It’s troubling for me when I see a piece of legislation like this brought out. When I’ve asked directly to the Premier and to cabinet ministers for very specific pieces of information, asking them a question here in this House, in front of the people of Ontario, I don’t get anything other than a shuffle of the question and saying, “Let’s move on. That’s history.”", "As I’ve said before, I have very big concerns with a lot of this. One thing I do like in there is that the bill would provide whistleblower protection for persons who disclose information to an inspector, investigator, special investigator or the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. I really like that it’s in there. It rings a bit hollow because we had whistleblowers come out within the Ornge concern. They brought things directly to our former member, Frank Klees, from Newmarket–Aurora, and nothing was done with that by this government opposite. They again just sloughed it off under the carpet, just tried to move on and said, “We’ve made changes. We’ve changed the board.” You might have changed the people in the chairs; you didn’t change the culture. You didn’t change the ability for those people to step up and truly do the right thing. At the end of the day, what I still have not heard is one single acknowledgment of any wrongdoing by that government, and we know there is, Mr. Speaker.", "If you’re going to bring a piece of legislation forward with transparency and accountability, stand behind it. Actions speak, as the old saying goes, much louder than words. Show us that you truly mean it, show us that you’re going to be a different government and then we’ll sit with you and we’ll try to work on a piece of legislation that truly will serve all the people of Ontario." ],

He drove down to Windsor—he talks so fast; he’s an auctioneer on the side. He helped a fundraising group in Windsor, the Do Good Divas, raise $65,000 at a charity auction, where they were auctioning off handbags and purses. They had a silent auction.", "This Conservative member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound drove down to Windsor, did his auctioneering, and we raised a ton of money. I have to say, I don’t know if it was because he left late or he got stuck on the highway—maybe he got a speeding ticket; I don’t know. But he got there a little bit late so I had to stand in, if you will, and take my time to drag things out, and I had to auction off some of the purses myself until he got there. But he did an excellent job—so good a job, in fact, they told me not to come back next year, but they want the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound back next year. So I want to thank him for that.", "I must say, I agree with a lot of what he had to say about Bill 8, because when we stand in this House and we hear “transparency and accountability,” we expect that’s what we’re going to see." ],

It’s amazing, because the House leader from the opposition was in municipal government when the previous Conservative government did omnibus bills every day. That happened all the time.", "They talk about consultation and the lack of consultation.

I know what it costs me the odd time I take it.", "So they talk about things that this government is doing. Well, you know, we talk about lack of consultation.

That’s what they’ve done with this bill.", "Talking about openness and transparency always gets them the headline. You look into the throne speech, and time after time they use those words. They make people think that they are actually going to make good on their words. In the throne speech, they talked about letting the justice committee write its report and do its work, but yet when we agreed before the election to have two final witnesses, the minute this government gets back in the chamber, they forget about that. When you’re in a committee and you talk about the MaRS lease agreements and the committee even goes so far as to say that because of commercial sensitivity they would deal with them in camera, the government members vote against that. Time after time after time, they say one thing and do something else.", "When we talk about being fair and reasonable, I think having committee hearings is part of what’s been going on in this Legislature since it began.

I would reference this piece of legislation. The context for me is that it falls within page 244 of the budget, which indicates that there’s going to be a 6% reduction in every ministry, aside from four, going forward. So perhaps that’s why—I’ve already shared my disdain for this piece of legislation. If you’re going to write a piece of legislation, at least have it be effective, at least let it actually accomplish something and not just wrap it up in a bow that says “transparency and accountability” on top of it.", "The member also, though, did mention that he lauds the intent around data protection. This obviously is an outstanding issue. It’s a hangover, if you will, from the last Legislature.", "We shouldn’t forget that this government has moved into a privatization mode, especially around data protection. That’s why you have the Guelph storage centre—$350 million. The taxpayers of the province paid for it. It’s only being used to 20% of its capacity. Instead, the government has opted to move to some consultants who are uploading data to the cloud. The cloud is less accessible, as opposed to being in a secure, government-run facility. So we are going to be watching that very carefully, as I’m sure the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound will." ],

When I was elected August 1, a year ago, in the by-election, I was going door-to-door on the night of that election, pulling the vote. One of the last doors I knocked on was a woman who was a former Liberal, she told me.

That’s what I’m trying to do. When I come here, I want to speak with integrity. I want to raise issues of credibility. I believe in transparency, and I believe that what we see in front of us today has very little to do with transparency or integrity or much of anything else.", "I can understand the need for the Liberals to want to change the channel, to put a different spin on things, because—with all due respect to the previous government—they went through a lot. They had the Ornge scandal. They had the gas plant scandal. They had the eHealth. Now this new government is having the MaRS scandal. There’s a lot on the plate.

If we come up with a good idea and they run with it, more power to them—particularly where it involves long-held NDP positions on capping salaries in the broader public service and greater oversight of parts of the MUSH sector by the Ombudsman.

We certainly look forward to that, Speaker. If you take, for example, the capping of the CEO salaries, if the province was serious about controlling costs at the executive level, it would go all-in. It would double down and adopt the NDP’s call for limiting annual executive salaries to $418,000, twice what the Premier makes. Twice what the Premier of Ontario brings in seems to me to be sufficient for somebody in a public service job. Why not? Instead of that, senior public servants, senior executives of agencies are making millions, and on top of that, they get millions more in severance if they leave. That’s money that could be better spent on health care and education, on hiring more people to look after the elderly and the sick.", "Some people in this province are doing well, some are doing really, really well, and then some not so well at all.

They represent 7,500 convenience store owners across the province.", "When I met with them earlier today, they told me, for example, more enforcement of those who make and sell illegal tobacco would help. But they also talked about a more universal approach to enforcement on store clerks who are caught selling tobacco to minors. What this brings in is that some health units, which we will see will be dealt with in a certain fashion in this bill, go out of their way—if, for example, you own a convenience store and you train your staff, but two of your staff make a mistake and sell to minors over a five-year period, as the owner, you will lose your licence. You won’t be able to sell tobacco anymore, and tobacco may make up 41% of your profit, sometimes more than 50%. Speaker, this bill does not address that.", "But if you’re the landlord of that building, after the convenience store owner leaves town because he’s lost his tobacco licence, you can’t even rent out that store, that space, to another convenience store owner because, for five years, there’s a ban put on by the health unit. Some health units do that. That has to change. Those are some of the things that should be in an omnibus bill if we’re going to correct legislation that truly needs some changes to be brought about.", "I know it’s hard for the people at home to keep following what goes on because we spread our debates over a number of hours and a number of days. I know others have talked about this bill; I know my colleague from Kenora–Rainy River is spot on when she said that “this bill is an attempt by this government to tilt the public perception away from that which the public presently has of” this government. That’s right. There is a perception about the government that they’re trying to change the channel on and switch gears to try to get people thinking they’re really being transparent and accountable. In my opinion, they’re not. I want to see them prove it at committee. I think it can be supported once improvements are made." ],

She did not even acknowledge, really, the question. In fact, the reality is that the former Minister of Health is now Treasury Board cabinet minister. In essence, that’s a reward. So you’ve taken a file like that and you’ve made a complete debacle of something that is about health care, is about the fundamental thing that most people watching and listening today care about, and that’s their health care—and there was nothing there.

It’s titled the Public Sector and MPP Accountability and Transparency Act. As I mentioned, it’s the result of 11 years of many instances of a lack of transparency and a lack of accountability. I think of eHealth, OLG, Caledonia, Ornge air ambulance—just mentioned by the previous speaker—the gas plant scandals, and now we’re trying to inject some transparency into what’s going on with respect to the gigantic MaRS building that you can see just out the front door of this Legislative Assembly. The scandals have all been obviously very, very costly in terms of dollars spent and certainly very costly in terms of the credibility of this government.", "I think of so many transgressions by cabinet ministers over the years when they did not step down, as is customary in the system of responsible government that has served this province going back to the 1850s. I recall, in question period, there were several calls and several requests for the then Minister of Health, during the Ornge era, during the two years that many of us spent on the Ornge committee, to step down—for the minister to resign—which is a normal thing to do in the province of Ontario system of responsible government.", "Addressing the bill more specifically, if you take a look at both schedule 1 and schedule 3 of the act, it puts a spotlight on the broader public sector, on accountability but also on compensation. It seems to focus primarily on cash wages. It doesn’t seem to focus on other indicators of compensation—pensions, vacation time, sick time, hours of work and many other perks that draw on the taxpayers’ dollar, like dental, early retirement. Even job security has a cost for those that are employed by the Ontario government.", "Let’s take a look at that; that’s my suggestion. Transparency is important. It’s important for accountability of the public sector, especially if you want to compare those who work in the public sector to those who work in the private sector. If you add up the perks, you’re 30% worse off in a private sector job. I don’t think that’s fair. That, to me, does not suggest any concept of pay equity, for example. It’s also expensive for the provincial budget.", "It does become disappointing. Bill 8 only looks at those who make $100,000 or more. This may have come from some of the NDP debate. This kind of leans more to tax-the-rich or perhaps looking at the 1%, but there are many, many people that make $98,000 a year or $90,000 a year—many, many people—a significant draw on the public purse.", "Don Drummond reported that half of all government spending is on public sector compensation. That’s something like well over $64 billion a year if we’re looking at a budget—and again, this is a bit of a transparency issue. I think our budget is coming in at about $130 billion this year. Those are dollars paid by people in the public sector, but by and large by people in the private sector. I think of private sector workers; many of them don’t have pensions. They are footing the bill for public sector workers who do have pensions, who do have expense accounts. I know this is mentioned in the legislation. Bill 8 seems to ignore public sector expense accounts, other than PAs, cabinet ministers and MPPs.", "I think the data is in. Again, if things were more transparent, we would know, but people who don’t work in the public sector don’t make nearly what people make on average in the public sector, the people they support in the public sector. I feel that people who are getting paid by taxpayers shouldn’t be getting a better deal than the people who are essentially paying the freight themselves.", "This Bill 8 proposed legislation in many ways doesn’t have much in the way of teeth. I don’t know how much of an impact it’s going to have on that $130-billion budget this year. It’s a bit of tinkering around the edges. I would ask this government to give us some amendments, give us some legislation that would shine some sunshine so we can compare public sector and private sector. We need a bill that would help us to cut back on spending. I would favour cutting back on taxes. Obviously, everyone here talks about cutting back on the deficit, eventually cutting back on the debt, a debt that is projected to come in four years hence at something like—well, Don Drummond indicated $411.4 billion. I ask people here: Consider your legacy. Consider where we’re going to be even four years from now.", "I’m in the baby boom crowd. I think our generation has had a good run. There has always been work if you wanted to do it. By and large, people were willing to work. We inherited a great system from the generation before us, something we think about during this time of remembrance. But I’m concerned. What are we handing to the generation following? Not only the economy but with respect to the fiscal accountability and transparency of this particular government. What kind of a debt are we handing down to those who are following us?", "Bill 8: I consider it a start. Oversight, obviously, saves money. We can’t bring in layer and layer of new staff and bureaucrats who do nothing but serve as overseers. Oversight is the job of management. We have management already. They’re paid to do this job.", "What really concerns me, though, is that it’s so hard to get the figures, to open up the books just to determine how unfair the system is if you compare public sector and private sector. The public sector in Ontario, on average, is making something like 30% more than the private sector, if you include job security, vacations and various perks. If you look at a $130-billion budget, that indicates that there’s an inequitable allocation of something like $19 billion a year over and above what public sector workers would normally be making at regular market rates. If we’re going to talk about transparency, I feel we should be documenting and addressing some of this.", "It raises the issue, going into the accountability side, of who is minding the store? Who’s responsible? Who do we hold accountable for some of these inequities? Just how rigorous is the oversight of the public payroll? There is the perception that public sector workers work shorter hours. There’s the perception that they have a myriad of other top-ups and perks. This has to be documented, and that can be done through a more transparent system.", "There’s a bit of research, Speaker. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business has done some work on this. It’s frustrating for them to try and pull the data. They have come up with a figure, and I quote: “… benefits and shorter work weeks, the public sector total compensation advantage balloons past 30%.”", "The Fraser Institute has done research on this and pulled together some data. But again, expert think tanks and groups have the wherewithal to pull this out. I think a lot of this stuff could be made much more public than it is.", "We know that salaries over 100 grand are published in the media. I have seen the direction really going the wrong way over the years. I was in a job a number of years ago—I taught high school. Every year, my salary would be published in the local daily paper. When I first started teaching high school, I recall, because I remember reading it in the paper, I was making $6,800 a year. Every teacher in the province of Ontario had their salary published in the paper. We’re debating transparency here. We don’t publish the salaries under $100,000.", "We’ve been hearing this afternoon, and certainly in question period this morning, discussions about Ornge. I think that anybody taking a program in management or business in the future would probably have a professor who would use the Ornge air ambulance debacle as a bit of a case study. I spent two years on that committee. Frank Klees raised so many questions, meeting after meeting during the deliberations, and there’s a wealth of information there. The OPP have been working on this stuff, I guess, for close to two years now. There’s still no report back from the OPP—criminal charges—so stay tuned for that one.", "We know that Bill 8 addresses the Ornge scandal. I’ll quote part of the legislation: “The Lieutenant Governor in Council may appoint one or more provincial representatives to … the board of directors of a designated air ambulance service,” in other words, Ornge—appoint special investigators and appoint supervisors. My concern, and I know we called for much of this during committee deliberations—more investigators, more supervisors—can we afford this? Can we afford the expense? It’s not only Ornge, but other agencies, ministry by ministry, other sectors that we should be overseeing. Can we afford to hire all these people? Isn’t oversight, isn’t transparency and accountability a function of management? We have managers within the public service. Do we necessarily need to hire so many other people to supervise and oversee what’s going on? I’m very concerned about the potential for more bureaucracy, and by extension more expense for the taxpayer.", "We also know that the bill will provide whistle-blower protection for people who disclose information “to an inspector … special investigator” or the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.", "Ornge has been in the coffee shops and in the headlines for several years now. I’ve had a chance to look at it up close. We all started with that report from Auditor General Jim McCarter and day after day of testimony before the committee. It has painted a picture that’s about as hard to understand now as it was two years ago of a complex, convoluted network known as Ornge, and it includes a list. Much of this really hasn’t been published yet. I don’t think much of this is in the report. There’s a list of spin-off private sector companies as long as your arm.", "The Auditor General can’t look at these companies. They’re kind of like Tarion. The AG cannot look at these organizations and private sector companies. Were they spun off using public sector money? Should we have the power to take a look at that? Should we have the power to take a look at Tarion, for that matter?", "Take a look at that report. I’ve had it on my desk, I guess, since four days before the election—a number of days before the election. It’s really unfortunate that it wasn’t released after we published it, but that was politics. Again, it’s a read—a lack of oversight, a lack of control, going back to the inception of Ornge. It didn’t seem like anybody was being held to account, certainly not the Minister of Health.", "The Auditor General’s report identified something like $700 million in government funding going out the door, with no follow-up. There was no oversight from the get-go. It’s an organization that was set up a number of years ago to ensure the safety and the timely transport of patients needing air ambulance services. They had agreements with the ministry.", "In 2006, they were to set and to monitor standards: The “end result will be improved care, improved access to service, increasing effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery of service, and the assurance of greater fiscal and medical accountability.” But the report really does paint a different picture. For example, we discovered that while funding to Ornge had increased something like 20% in 2006-07, the number of patients had actually decreased by 6%.", "Land ambulance: Ornge received $65 million to perform what are called inter-facility land ambulance transfers, projected to number 20,000 annually. However, Ornge was only providing 15% of that number of projected transfers. We saw the ministry continue to dole out the cash, really oblivious to where the money was going, and we saw the board.", "This legislation does put a bit more control over the board, and I think that’s a good idea. The board, the management at the time, created that network of for-profit and not-for-profit subsidiaries, other companies and all kinds of financial, convoluted arrangements. It was very difficult to figure out what was going on out there.", "The corporate head office: Here’s a good example of a convoluted arrangement. As the auditor pointed out, Ornge used $15 million, borrowed through a bond issue, to purchase the building that presently houses the corporate head office. Then they entered into a complex arrangement with other entities. They sold the building and then leased it back to themselves. That didn’t go over very well, in the auditor’s view. He calculated: “Over the first five years of the 25-year lease, this amounts to Ornge paying $2 million more” than it should pay—again, a lack of oversight.", "They borrowed $300 million to finance, amongst other things, 12 new helicopters, 10 new airplanes and 11 used helicopters—twice as many helicopters as they could use. Again, where does the responsibility lie? Where is the accountability? We heard this again and again over the last several years. It lies with the Minister of Health, who didn’t resign over any of this.", "When we talked about Ornge—and I’ll spell Ornge: it’s O-R-N-G-E. The A is missing. In our view, that A stands for accountability. Accountability was missing. To spend two years on this committee, you had to come up with something to keep going.", "Something else that came up—and maybe I’ll just fast-forward quickly. We know that the OPP investigation is outstanding. Those of us on that committee have become a little cynical. I’ve become cynical about politicians and about bureaucrats when we see that government control and accountability and oversight were absent—not only on the money, but with respect to the health and safety of the patients—so many red flags that add up to a tremendous list of mismanagement, really.", "Again, it all lies with management, in my view. Evaluation, control, oversight and accountability are all functions of management. If management isn’t doing the job, I feel someone should be found who does do the job.", "But I question—and perhaps I could question, our own Ornge report: Do we necessarily need to hire layer after layer of people to oversee management? Let’s let management do their job." ],

This is really surprising to me because if he looks at the research and the evidence and how this government has accelerated the privatization agenda—and that’s what it is. It’s happening in almost every ministry. I know this because I’m the critic for the Treasury Board, so my job is to follow the money. When you follow the money, you see very, very clearly that public services are being contracted out at very poor value to the people of this province. It’s happening in IT, on road maintenance. There’s even talk now of privatizing jails because that’s working so well for the United States, don’t you agree?", "So when the member from Haldimand–Norfolk says that the red flag has been raised on these layers of bureaucrats who are from the private sector who are being paid twice as much—two to three times as much as in-house management is—in fact, in some instances, it’s just beyond—it’s like a Monty Python skit. There are private sector managers who are dictating to people who actually know how to do the work, and they’re getting paid twice as much. I mean, only in Ontario, apparently.", "Perhaps there’s some common ground.

I don’t know how that could happen. But I do want to talk about salary disclosure because he did raise salary disclosure and maybe reducing the amount that we set as a bar to disclose. If you take a look at salary disclosure, sometimes there are unintended consequences when you do things. What salary disclosure became for the broader public service, the MUSH sector, was actually a pay scale, a grade that people would check and, I would argue, had a serious impact on those salaries. That’s why we need to have some restrictions around executive compensation. I know of a lot of examples where people just went there and looked and boards of directors made decisions based on that as something like a salary grid.", "I also want to talk about salary disclosure because I want to talk about another bill about accountability brought forth in the 39th Parliament by the member from Nepean–Carleton with the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook that was called the Truth in Government Act. Now the Truth in Government Act had a lot of pieces like we have in this piece of legislation—not as broad, but a good piece of work that talked about members’ expenses. It used the Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act—it used the schedule in there to say that this is who it applies to. So it applies to everybody in that schedule except for section (j). What is section (j)? The Legislative Assembly—so truth in government does not apply here. The one thing I learned from that is, be careful what you name your bill." ],

I mean, that in itself is a lesson for all of us, but particularly for this government. She couldn’t afford to go to work. She actually kept more of her money and could keep her children better if she was on social assistance than if she worked on minimum wage. There’s something wrong with that economy, I’ll tell you. She really wanted to work and was making every effort to try to get programs so that she could earn more than minimum wage if she did go back.", "This is the woman who raised the issue to me—the only time it happened, actually, interestingly, in my riding—about the gas plant expenses, and how many billions this government has spent over the last 11 years, wasted on various enterprises. Lest we forget: eHealth, Ornge, the gas plants. Billions.

How can this patient ombudsman be critical of the cabinet who hires him or her, number one, and can fire him or her at any time?

Anybody can see that that’s impossible.", "How can this ombudsman be impartial—able to be fired by the government at any time because there’s no set term, and has no oversight of Ornge?

We heard today, in question period, about the 44 clinics who have completely dropped the ball in terms of patient safety. By the way, there’s nothing new about this either. My uncle actually came here—well, actually, he came here when he was ailing but his niece came here after his demise because he died of C. difficile. Does anybody here remember C. difficile in the hospitals and how difficult it was—again, accountability and transparency—to find the statistics on C. diff in our hospitals and our health care system? How difficult it was because we are the only province in Canada—let me repeat that: the only province in Canada—that does not have real ombudsman oversight over its hospital and health care system?", "This patient ombudsman will not be that person. If you’re listening and you’re watching and you’re signing those petitions, know this: This patient ombudsman will not be that person. Here’s a scenario; it’s probably not an unusual one: You have a loved one, a relative in a hospital or a health care centre, that relative dies and you have questions about their care. You want to investigate whether they got the care they deserved or not. You can’t do it with this patient ombudsman. You can’t do it, unless the patient has, before their untimely death, let’s say, actually put you as the executor, given you the legal responsibility to look into their affairs; you can’t investigate. It has to be the patient that does the investigating. What kind of structure is that? The patient who is ill or possibly dead has to do the investigating of their own care? Again, as you heard outlined, this ombudsman can’t look at private clinics, can’t look at retirement homes—again, a problem.", "You heard again about the children and youth advocate. By the way, the children and youth advocate says it does not go far enough. It does not give him the powers he needs to look into children’s aid and what they’re doing. We’ve long called for that, of course, oversight over them. He can’t compel evidence, can’t look into mental health or the justice system. Again, not that long ago, I remember a group of parents coming to Queen’s Park and holding a press conference, called Tragically NOHIP. Anybody remember that? It was a great slogan. Why? Because their children who suffered from mental health issues, many of them serious ones, many of them suicidal, could not find care in the province of Ontario. They had to mortgage their homes, had to dig into their savings to send them out of province to find care. Tragically NOHIP—I remember that group very well. Again, it’s within the memory of someone who has served here eight years—not transparent, not accountable and not ever addressed.", "The Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions: I think it was 23 recommendations, of which only three have been put into place. Again, transparency and accountability are not there either, not for those children.", "What else? We heard about the executive so-called cap. To go back to my friend from Etobicoke Centre—congratulations on his election—who tried to argue that there is a cap in this legislation, there is no cap in this legislation. There is the promise to look at a cap in this legislation. My friends around the chamber, legislation is not a campaign promise. It shouldn’t be. It shouldn’t be yet another promise to look into something. The legislation is supposed to be the promise enacted. That’s the point of policy. That’s the difference between actual policy and campaign promises. But what we see here about caps for compensation for those in the public sector is yet again another promise to look into it, not a hard cap, not any of that. You don’t need a piece of policy, you don’t need a bill to say you’re going to look into what the cap should be. You just do it. You look into what the cap should be, and then you write the policy. That’s not transparent or accountable either.", "That would leave my single parent trying to raise two children on social assistance with some very big questions because she would say—she’s not a lawyer and she’s not a legislator—“I read this and there’s no cap in here. What is the cap?” she would say. “Where is the cap?” I would have to say, “Well, we called for $418,000, twice the Premier’s salary, but unfortunately this legislation does not deliver on that.”", "We heard again today in question period, not that long ago, about consultants hired, really with the ostensible duty to privatize our electrical system—at least part of it, so they say—but we don’t know who they are, and we asked, and we don’t know how much they make.

I can tell you that there are folk in my riding who would very much like to come to those hearings. I hope they get a chance, and I suspect they won’t, because again, they’re shutting down debate on an important bill that came out of children’s deaths and an absolutely scathing report from the real Ombudsman on child care in this province—absolutely scathing. Read that report. If you read nothing else this year, read that report. That’s about our children. Children’s deaths led to that report that led, presumably, to this piece of legislation. This piece of legislation ain’t going to save any children.

I had the pleasure, for the last two years, of being quite involved with the Ornge air ambulance report, chairing the public accounts committee for the past two years. I was really pleased to see that the report was just tabled recently in the Legislature. It’s a substantial report. I’m hoping that the government learns and uses that report. There was a lot of work put into it over two years by members of all parties, and I certainly want to thank some of the members who spent an awful lot of time working on it, in particular Frank Klees, who was the member from Newmarket–Aurora; France Gélinas, the member from Nickel Belt; Helena Jaczek, who’s now a minister, of course, the member for Oak Ridges; Jagmeet Singh; and education minister Liz Sandals, who I think was there before Helena Jaczek. Those members in particular spent an awful lot of time on the report.", "The reason I’m happy to see it, besides all the work, and I think there are a lot of good recommendations that come out of the report—it was actually the Wednesday before the election was called on the Friday that the committee, at its regular meeting, signed off on it. It was going to the printer to be printed. It was going to be tabled in this Legislature on the Monday following that. We were in the midst of a provincial election at that stage, so I was quite concerned that it may never see the light of day, so I’m pleased that it has actually been tabled in the Legislature. This bill, Bill 8, in a small part addresses some things that come out of the report, but there’s still far more that can be done.", "On the topic of ambulances, I do want to raise an issue that’s directly connected with ambulances in my riding of Parry Sound–Muskoka, and that is the situation that’s occurring in the northern part of the riding, in Port Loring-Argyle. Mr. Speaker, you may be familiar with that area, as I know you do spend some time in the summer at your family’s cottage up there, enjoying beautiful Parry Sound–Muskoka.", "It’s an issue of real concern to me right now. Essentially, at this present moment, if you were in Port Loring, Mr. Speaker, at your family’s cottage, and you had some serious medical emergency, you might wait two hours for an ambulance, because there is not an ambulance station there anymore. There was until this summer, but it was a unique area in that it was the only area in the whole province that had volunteer paramedics. They had two volunteer paramedics who did a great job. That was getting hard to sustain because of all the training and qualifications required. Unfortunately, one of the paramedics passed away this summer, so that ended. Now we have a situation where there isn’t an ambulance station there.", "It’s actually administered by the town of Parry Sound, which makes the final decisions on the whole district of Parry Sound’s ambulance services. They have an emergency services advisory committee. I attended a public meeting—I think it was in late August, early September—up in Port Loring, which was at the Legion hall. The building was full of people and they were very passionate about the fact that they don’t have proper coverage right now. One of their complaints was that the advisory committee that advises the town of Parry Sound doesn’t have any representation from the unorganized territories. I have since learned that to get representation, they need to apply to the town of Parry Sound to try to get representation.", "The town of Parry Sound in the summertime—I believe it was in July—made the decision to try to provide coverage, and they were going to take a 12-hour shift from the village of South River, the night shift, and move it to Port Loring, move an ambulance and crew there for a 12-hour shift, and then it would be on call for the other 12 hours.", "Unfortunately, there was a lot of pushback from all east Parry Sound, all the municipalities that didn’t want to lose existing ambulance service that they already have, and I could see their point of view as well. Then the committee again met in August and they came up with what is the situation currently, and that is that there’s basically an SUV station in the Port Loring-Argyle area and there is a fully qualified paramedic who is there for a 12-hour shift and on call for another 12-hour shift. The problem is that there’s no actual ambulance.", "You, of course, Mr. Speaker, are very familiar with the area, so you know it’s not close to any hospital. It’s probably at least an hour drive, one way, for an ambulance to get to the area and then another hour back, so you’re probably two hours to get to a hospital. And it’s huge, so that could go up by a significant amount as well. I think it’s a real concern that there’s not actually an ambulance station there. It’s something that I would like to see changed.", "They are consulting right now. The town of Parry Sound and the advisory committee have hired a consultant to look at coverage for the entire Parry Sound district, I assume, to see if they can maybe shuffle things around a bit. The only problem with that is that other areas of this district, if they feel they’re losing services, are not going to be happy about it.", "I think we need to look at possible solutions. Certainly dollars and cents are a consideration. I think the number I heard was $1.2 million if you want to station an ambulance there full time with paramedics etc. Perhaps creative solutions—they’ve had volunteer paramedics in the past. What about volunteer drivers? They’ve already got a vehicle there. Station an ambulance there, and perhaps have volunteer drivers; maybe you could use volunteer firefighters and train them to be the drivers for an ambulance that was stationed there. Use the paramedic who is already assigned, and then you would at least have transportation. I think that’s one possibility at least, and I certainly will look forward to seeing what comes out of the report.", "I absolutely feel that the distance and location of Port Loring-Argyle is such that there absolutely needs to be an ambulance station there. Currently, at this time, the area is not being properly served and is at risk. Seeing as we were talking about ambulances today, and there’s a whole section in Bill 8 to do with ambulances, I wanted to get that on the record.", "I’ll now go on to speak about other sections of the bill. I see that Schedule 1 deals with the Broader Public Sector Executive Compensation Act. Today in question period, the member from Dufferin–Caledon asked a question specifically about community care access centres. I don’t know the name of their particular CCAC, but she pointed out that their executive director is making some $260,000 and just received some sort of $24,000 bonus or increase.", "I have problems with that. I have problems with that because as MPPs, we’ve all, on a daily basis, had people coming to our office who are trying to get coverage for someone. The hours that are meted out for home care or personal support workers—I think it’s 12 hours maximum per week. The government’s intended aging-at-home policy is to keep people in their homes, but then they don’t provide enough home care to actually keep people in their homes.", "I know I met with a son in the last month or so; his two parents are aging, and they have various complications, and it was exactly about that issue. I have a problem that the personal support workers don’t make a lot of money, and there seems to be so much in the administration part of it, including the executive directors. I just simply feel that you could hire people for less money than that to do that job, and the savings should be passed on to provide more services for the front-line care.", "I know that I recently had an inquiry in the Parry Sound area from a person who, just in the past year, had an accident and is now a paraplegic. They’re trying to figure out how to cope, and they’re being told by the CCAC, “Well, we can only provide this much care,” and it’s not enough. So when you see that scenario and then look at the huge salaries being paid out, I think there should be some controls.", "I come back to Ornge. The trigger for the government finally digging deeper into Ornge air ambulance—really, one of the big red flags was Dr. Chris Mazza’s pay. Only through a long, long time and the committee doing an awful lot of digging did it come out that he was making more than $1 million a year yet wasn’t showing up on the sunshine list. I think it’s certainly an issue that needs to be dealt with.", "We’ve heard from other members saying that this legislation doesn’t really adequately deal with the issue, but I think, in principle, it is something that a government with limited dollars needs to look at.", "I can see that it’s almost time to stop talking. I’ll talk a bit about one other section, and let me just see which section it is. It’s the section to do with the Lobbyists Registration Act. I’m not sure which schedule that is—here it is; it’s schedule 8. We have pretty weak lobbyist legislation in Ontario. It did come up in the Ornge air ambulance situation that somebody was lobbying, and they were found to be lobbying despite not being registered. Basically, there’s nothing at this time that the lobbyist registrar, who is Ontario’s Integrity Commissioner, can do about it. This legislation purports to strengthen that and give some enforcement powers to the Ontario Integrity Commissioner. I certainly think that needs to happen because right now, when they do find that someone is breaking the rules, really there’s no penalty. So that is something that needs to be improved.", "I see my time is out, so I will end my comments now." ],

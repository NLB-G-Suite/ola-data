I think I’ve got five minutes or so to discuss this legislation, and I’m happy to have that opportunity.", "I think it’s important that we note that throughout the process, our goal has to been to change the way politics is done in Ontario. That’s why the Premier directed caucus to stop hosting large-scale fundraisers where ministers interacted solely with stakeholders in their portfolio. That’s why we brought forward a bill that banned corporate and union donations entirely.", "Many people will know, because there were a number of communities that hosted events, that over the summer months, after first reading—I think it’s important to point that out—we heard from opposition parties and from experts in the general public on how we could improve this particular bill. I don’t think we can overstate that it’s very unusual—and for members of the public who are following this debate on television to understand and realize the unique step that was taken when we allowed this bill to travel after first reading. Most people probably are not aware that that rarely happens. The Premier saw such importance in this particular bill and wanted to provide as much opportunity as possible for people to provide their input and to provide for potential amendments that this bill did, in fact, travel after first reading over the course of the summer. I think that is very, very significant and I think it speaks to the seriousness with which we take this issue and our attempt to bring forward legislation that really reflects the will of the people of the province of Ontario.", "As a result of that, we brought forward comprehensive amendments that included lowering contribution limits even further, creating a clear definition of third-party advertising and strengthening limits for government advertising before an election.", "To address the issue of fundraising events, we proposed working with all political parties to develop a code of conduct. In order to strengthen democracy and its institutions, we want to continue to show leadership by going another step further. That’s why we will be bringing forward an amendment to ban fundraising events for all MPPs, candidates, party leaders, nomination contestants and leadership contestants. There were no amendments before the committee that went as far as we need to go on this issue, and that’s why we will be bringing those forward.", "Rules on fundraising should apply equally to all parties. Banning fundraising events is a significant change that will affect both parties and riding associations. That’s why our amendment will also increase the per-vote allowance.", "Speaker, with Bill 2 we are going to fundamentally change the way politics is done in Ontario. I want to talk a little bit about the process that we used to get here. We first introduced legislation in the spring that the Chief Electoral Officer called “the most significant redesign of Ontario election laws” in 40 years.", "For changes as monumental as we are considering, we needed to take it to Ontarians, and we passed a motion that I referenced earlier, allowing the Standing Committee on General Government to sit for four weeks over the summer and hold hearings across the province. As I said, that was after first reading, which does not happen often. The committee heard from Ontarians in Ottawa, Kingston, Toronto, Kitchener-Waterloo, London and Windsor. We want to thank Ontarians who came out and gave their feedback on this particular bill. Their ideas were incorporated into amendments designed to strengthen the legislation.", "Now, as I said, we have a bill that will remove even the perception of undue influence on our political and electoral system. How are we doing this? Speaker, if passed, Bill 2 will lower the maximum contribution amount to $1,200 to a nomination contestant or constituency association, $1,200 to a candidate and $1,200 to a leadership contestant as well. That will lower the maximum contribution amount from $33,250 under the current system to just under $3,600, a 90% reduction.", "Speaker, the Election Finances Statute Law Amendment Act, if passed, would fundamentally change the way we do politics, as I’ve mentioned. We’re going to ban corporate and union donations, we’re going to lower the limits that I have referenced already, and it would place restrictions on third-party advertising.", "We allowed debate to continue when we reached 6.5 hours of debate on the bill so that more members would have an opportunity to present their views on the bill. This bill has seen nearly 10 hours of debate, and according to my count, we have heard nearly half of the members of this Legislature speak to the bill. Speaker, there’s been considerable debate on this bill and we have heard a wide range of viewpoints, opinions and perspectives. Unfortunately, much of the debate has been repeating points already made by other members.", "It’s time that the bill is put to a vote for second reading and hopefully be referred to committee, where important work takes place. In committee, members of all parties will hear from stakeholders that have an interest in this bill. Members of the public will be able to provide their important input on this bill. In committee, members will have an opportunity to move amendments to strengthen the bill, and this House can move on to debate other matters.", "Speaker, there are other important pieces of legislation already introduced, which the government would like to debate and move through the legislative process: one, Bill 27, the Burden Reduction Act; and two, Bill 7, Promoting Affordable Housing Act. As a result of that, we would like to spend time debating some of the other important pieces of legislation currently before the House, but we can’t until Bill 2 is referred to committee for further review. Speaker, as result, I move that this question be now put." ],

But the fact of the matter is, Speaker, that the opposition members haven’t had adequate opportunity to speak. When he uses numbers, it’s because the Liberals, instead of speaking for 20 minutes or 10 minutes, break up the rotation into five-minute blocks. So by sheer numbers—and they have the most people in the Legislature—they have numbers that speak but not for a great length of time. So the members of the opposition who would like an opportunity to have their 10 minutes to say what they feel is important about this bill or inadequate about this bill have not had that opportunity.", "So, Speaker, thank you for saving democracy in this House this morning.

Maybe some of the members on that side of the House know what they’re tabling. To say that MPPs can’t attend fundraisers and yet don’t table that—I attended a fundraiser in my riding last Thursday for the Rotary Club. Am I allowed to attend that fundraiser? Or are we only talking about political fundraisers?", "The member for Kingston and the Islands really opened my eyes because I think this is what the government is talking about. She said, “It is important for our constituents to have access, and having fundraisers or having events where it is a cost-recovery basis I think is going to allow a lot more people to engage with us.” Here’s the kicker, Speaker. Here’s her next sentence: “If some choose, after the fact, to contribute financially, that’s great.”", "Let me get this straight. The Minister of Energy quoted one of my fundraisers in the House the other day. I was a little shocked because it wasn’t actually a particularly good fundraiser. I think one of the tickets for his cash-for-access fundraiser far exceeds what I made on that. But the one thing he talked about was my two colleagues Senator Bob Runciman and MP Gord Brown. There’s an event in my riding, Afternoon in the Islands. It’s been going for 30 years. It’s basically a community event. We make a little bit of money. It’s a $150 fundraiser. We probably give a tax receipt for maybe $60 because it’s a high-value fundraiser. Many of my constituents come, probably more constituents than anyone else.

I respect the Speaker’s ruling but I do believe that to have a summer of committee, where we hear from so many people, and then you don’t even have the guts to table your own amendments to a bill—what does that say for a government that’s out of touch and out of control?

Banning government advertising: I said many, many times during this committee meeting, when Bill 201 was debated—now Bill 2—that the government should look to other jurisdictions. They just had an election in Manitoba. They had a three-month ban on government advertising. I asked many deputants if they agreed; many of them did agree. This government, when they tabled amendments, didn’t listen to the opposition. They put a 60-day amendment. I hope that the government members will agree that the Manitoba rules were good rules, and they should be incorporated by this government.", "But there’s one glaring omission in this bill. Again, I don’t understand what the problem is with this government and the Auditor General. I don’t understand why every other Legislature seems to have a respectful relationship with the Auditor General. This government had the opportunity at first reading—I want to remind people that the reason this bill went out at first reading was because the Premier said that she wanted to have a co-operative venture with the three parties, that she wanted to have a free discussion, that she wanted to have other ideas brought forward. Outside the scope of that bill, we had the opportunity to give the Auditor General back her powers when it comes to government advertising, something that the lion’s share of deputants agreed on with us. This government shut it down. This government would not support giving the Auditor General back her powers.", "I want to thank the New Democrats.

They did it in the middle of the day when a lot of independent business owners couldn’t attend, when a lot of people that work during the day cannot come out because, frankly, thanks to the Liberal government, they cannot afford to take time off to come out to a committee and speak.", "Frankly, it was a farce. It was not really consultation. Every time somebody voiced their concerns about the bill that the government side had brought forward—the suggestions the government brought forward—they actually shut that person down and challenged them because they didn’t agree with them.", "So I would say to the minister that perhaps next time you get up to speak about the people on this side of the House not wanting debate shut down, wanting our constituents’ concerns heard, that you have the respect that our constituents need and not say that we’re sitting over here boo-hooing because we want our constituents heard. Perhaps, Minister, that’s why you no longer have a Liberal cabinet minister in Windsor West.", "I think that we do need to have more debate on this, whether they want to hear it or not. They’ve had their opportunity to spread out their time amongst as many members as they want, and that’s probably because their members really have nothing of substance to add to the debate because they’re not listening to their constituents. I can’t support shutting down debate." ],

I only spoke about members who made speeches for the debate, which were Mr. Hillier, Mr. Walker, Mr. Fedeli, Mr. Miller, Mr. Barrett and myself. That’s the facts.", "I do want to acknowledge what the members for Windsor talked about. Both of them made some great comments. The member for Windsor West did talk about the fact that they were in the middle of the day. The thing that no one has acknowledged yet—this is new debate for you Liberals over there—is the fact that many of those meetings were cancelled because of lack of interest. One of our dates in Ottawa was cancelled; our day in Windsor was shortened to basically an hour. The meeting in Ottawa—there were meetings in Toronto and Hamilton that were cancelled as well. So she’s right; when you have hearings in the summer, that’s what you deal with.", "I would hope that the government would have a lot of hearings on this, again, to get those comments, because I know a number of people were disappointed that their recommendations were not listened to. Again, my question is, why hasn’t the government tabled the amendments that they’ve talked about since that last session in Toronto? Why are they hiding those amendments that would deal with members and fundraising? I had to read Hansard and listen to the debate to get an insight into how the member for Kingston and the Islands feels this cost-recovery event should take place. I’ve had people ask me if I Skype into fundraising. When we’re on the St. Lawrence and they’re on the banks of the St. Lawrence, do I drive by in a boat, weigh anchor and make a speech out in the harbour?", "Some of these things, these concepts, are crazy.

I want to just, before I begin, give a particular shout-out to the media and journalists like Adrian Morrow for their strong investigative research and their ability to bring this story forward. It was very much the media that fuelled this issue.", "It’s important for us to reflect on the context. The problem was twofold. One, there was strong evidence that the government was conducting cash-for-access, much like the member before me spoke about—that particular issue, that there was cash-for-access to ministers who made government decisions. That’s very important to make that distinction. It wasn’t cash-for-access to someone who wasn’t able to make a government decision, who wasn’t in a position of cabinet; it was a very specific issue that the journalists were able to focus on.", "The problem is that we expect, Ontarians expect, that the government will make decisions that are in the best interests of the people, not decisions based on who attends the fundraiser. When there is a very clear perception that cash is being provided to have simple access to a minister and that specific stakeholders that deal with a particular ministry are being specifically targeted just for access, it starts raising this perception that the government is not conducting itself in a manner that is appropriate.", "The second concern was conflict of interest. I was able to raise this concern and I was very thankful for the Integrity Commissioner’s response. The current laws don’t govern this concern that was raised, and it’s important to note that. We noted that the current laws, as the Integrity Commissioner pointed out, don’t cover this scenario. We needed to add some amendments to make sure they’re addressed. The government did not accept those amendments.", "What was the problem? There was one specific scenario where it became very apparent that there was some—whether it was actual impropriety; certainly there was the perception of impropriety: the sale of Hydro One. That’s a particular scenario where we know very clearly—independent evidence suggests and a policy basis suggests—that the sale of Hydro One does not benefit the people of Ontario. No one believes that it benefits Ontario. As much as the Premier stands up and says, “Oh, this is to benefit the people by broadening ownership,” there’s nothing broader than every single person in the province of Ontario. So that argument doesn’t make sense.", "The second argument that we need to sell off a revenue-generating asset in order to raise funds to build infrastructure was shot down as being illogical and unaffordable—in fact, the most expensive and wasteful way to raise money. We have not the opinion of the NDP or the Conservatives; we have the opinion of the Financial Accountability Officer, who makes it very clear that this is the worst way to raise money, and, in fact, it is going to put the province into a worse financial position.", "You have a decision that’s going to put the province in a worse position. You have a decision that doesn’t benefit the people of Ontario. Who does it benefit? A small group of lawyers and bankers named the syndicate. This very same group throws a massive fundraiser for the Minister of Energy and the Minister of Finance, the two ministers responsible for the sale. That has a serious perception of being a conflict, and that serious perception of a conflict is what brought about the concern.", "The government has not addressed this direct concern. This is the issue that’s of concern, but what is the government doing instead? The government is limiting the voice of communities of citizens who want to get together as an association and complain about government policies or specifically just raise a concern. We put forward amendments saying, “Listen, we understand there’s a concern with partisan third-party ads. If someone says you must vote for so-and-so party or you should vote for a particular candidate, there are concerns with that.” But if a community gets together and says, “Listen, we want the people of our province, the people in our community, to consider the environment in the next election. We want people to consider funding for autism in the next election”—generally speaking, policies that they care about—those are now banned by this government. So the community can’t get together and say, “Hey, we think that child care is an important issue for us to look at.” They’re not saying which party to vote for, they’re not saying which candidate to vote for, but this is banned by this government.", "What’s not banned, Mr. Speaker? In 2015, the government took away the power, the oversight of the Auditor General to say, “Particular government ads are overly partisan and should not be played, should not move forward.” That’s allowed; the government can do that. The government can put forward any ad they want and have no oversight or scrutiny. Before, for an ad that was proposed by the government, the Auditor General would look at it and say, “Do you know what? This ad does not advance any sort of policy for the people. It’s clearly partisan in nature. It’s clearly just a self-congratulatory message. That’s not an appropriate use of public dollars.” That was a strong oversight mechanism that this government got rid of. This bill, which purports to protect against perceptions of conflict of interest, which purports to protect against the very problems that were raised by the journalists, including cash-for-access, does not reintroduce that oversight. Again, the government can do any sort of ads they want without any scrutiny, without anyone saying that that ad is—" ],

The heart of the issue is that people who are in cabinet, people who are ministers, who have direct influence over decisions the government makes are in a completely different position than those who are not. Backbenchers and opposition members are an absolutely different scenario. When ministers or cabinet members can make decisions that affect the province, there must be a separate analysis with respect to how they can do that, how they can interact with the public in terms of fundraising and interact with private interest groups in terms of fundraising, and how that should not impact their decision-making. There is a colossal difference between a cabinet member and a minister and an opposition member or a backbencher. That’s where this government completely fails to understand the severity of the situation.", "In fact, I have a great quote from Konrad Yakabuski—I know he’s no relation to our own member, the Conservative member—from an article, “How Low Can the Ontario Liberals Go? Just Watch Them.” It’s a Globe and Mail article and a very powerful summary. This is the reporter speaking: “The average MPP holding a $100-a-ticket potluck has little direct power and those who attend such events know it. They are there to support an individual and his or her agenda in an entirely legitimate manifestation of the democratic process. When the energy minister invites a few electricity-sector executives to a private dinner in exchange for thousands of dollars in donations, however, you know said executives don’t show up to talk about the weather.” The reporter clearly gets the difference.", "There is a massive difference. The proposals by this government don’t address that. The proposals by this government don’t address the problem, which is cash-for-access. The government doesn’t address the perception of conflict of interest. The government rejected many amendments which would have addressed the conflict of interest.", "In addition, the government rejected amendments that would address lobbying and change the way lobbying is done so that there can be some clear guidelines around that to address the real heart of the problem, which is the cash-for-access and the conflict-of-interest issues. Again, the government has not addressed those issues.", "If we summarize it, the problem with all of this is, at the end of the day, people are becoming cynical, and have become cynical, about politics. When the government fuels the cynicism by completely avoiding the root problem, they’re actually assisting in creating a system where people are less and less likely to vote. What happens is that allows the status quo to remain, and the status quo is the cynicism that has fuelled the whole thing from the beginning. That’s why it’s so important for us to take this issue seriously and to address it in a meaningful way. It is our duty to restore that trust in the public administration and to restore that trust in politicians, and this government is failing to do that." ],

We’re not, in any way, demeaning or decreasing employment standards or consumer protections. I sit beside a former minister of consumer protection, and we make sure, as we’re reducing regulatory burden, that we’re reducing what we call unnecessary regulatory burden. But when it comes to standards across the province, we have to make sure that we have strong standards in this province. We make sure they’re competitive.

This gives us, in government—and it gives the opposition an opportunity to participate as well. I’m always open to suggestions from the opposition on ways we can reduce regulatory burden. I can’t think of anything more non-partisan than reducing regulatory burden—because it’s not like people vote for politicians or governments because of a regulatory Burden Reduction Act.

They were the first sector that we turned to for our Red Tape Challenge, which is a brand new, Open Government effort, modelled after an effort that worked very well in Great Britain, where a sector can participate and give us their feedback online on how to reduce regulatory burden in that particular sector.", "Why that’s important is that, in the past, we’ve had some great success saving hundreds of millions of dollars for businesses by sitting at round tables with the business sector and tackling five or six items that were important to that particular sector, bringing it forward, committing to do it and getting it done. We’ve been able to reduce dozens of regulatory burdens through that process. It’s become a bit of a global best practice, so we’ll continue to do that work.", "But what that doesn’t do is it doesn’t reach out to the front line of businesses. Your typical small business person isn’t sitting around those tables. We’ll have a representative from small businesses there. It doesn’t reach out to everyday Ontarians or workers and unions and front-line workers in some of these businesses, who have something to say about red tape and may well have some great ideas for us. What this does is it reaches out, beyond the confines of our usual round-table-type meetings with sectors and associations, to everyone in the province and gives them an opportunity to participate.", "The first Red Tape Challenge with the auto parts community went extremely well. The next Red Tape Challenge now is with the agriculture sector—with the food processing sector, I believe it is. We’re looking forward to getting feedback from them as well.", "I’m really pleased to move forward with this initiative. I also need to thank my Open for Business team in the ministry. We’ve completely revamped our ministry to be more proactive and more streamlined when it comes to attacking our Open for Business challenges and our efforts to reduce regulatory burden. In fact, we’ve remodeled our entire government in some ways to set up internal mechanisms that move those decisions to the top so that our secretary of cabinet, our business adviser, Ed Clark, and my deputy minister sit on a panel that helps drive from the top down. Usually you’ll try to do things from the bottom up. In this case, though, in making change in government, it’s important to have it from the top down so that it will encourage ministries to continue to drive changes that reduce burden on business.", "My Open for Business team has done a fantastic job. They’re a creative group of people. When people think of bureaucrats, they’re not your typical public servant bureaucrats. They’re really outward-facing, they’re really keen to be involved with the business community and they’re doing a magnificent job leading our province.", "Mr. Speaker, I’ve probably got a minute left for now. I may well, if I’m back when this comes up for debate, be able to finish. If not, my able parliamentary assistant will when the debate comes back up. But let me finish by thanking my colleagues. Eleven ministries have had input into this bill. This isn’t a bill that my ministry has come up with. It’s really the 11 ministries that have worked with their sectors that have made these suggestions and put them forward, so I thank those folks in those ministries, my colleagues and their teams for the work they’ve done on this.", "I thank the opposition in advance for the co-operation that they’ll probably bring to this because they understand the importance of reducing regulatory burden as well, Mr. Speaker—and I’m looking to you now and I’m assuming that my time is expiring, because I think next in line is question period for the day and that’s the most exciting part of the day for many of us in this Legislature. I’ll sit down for the moment and we’ll see what happens." ],

He went to work with his father-in-law and helped build United Maple Products into one of Canada’s largest maple syrup producers.", "What he accomplished in business was remarkable. Indeed, many entrepreneurs in my riding will tell you that they owe their success to Don’s mentorship.", "But success in business did not define Don. Together with Shirley, he built a legacy of philanthropy that stretched around the world and would change lives at home and abroad for generations. From the Brockville YMCA to Brockville General Hospital, countless organizations and people of all ages were benefactors of their generosity. When a fundraising drive suddenly made its goal thanks to an anonymous donor, we all knew that Don and Shirley were likely responsible. Around the globe, the Greens were champions of Canadian Aid for Chernobyl and gave $2 million to build a village for orphans in Namibia. Don set an example we can all follow: to use our good fortune to provide hope and opportunity to those less fortunate.", "Speaker, I join all residents of Leeds–Grenville in extending my heartfelt condolences to Shirley, Don’s beloved wife of 60 years, and their children, Donald Jr., Ellen and Debbie." ],

Every night, there are 10 names drawn out of the drum. If you’re in attendance and your name is picked on the last night—it’s 30 people, and the last person picked wins a car. The local dealers, every year, take turns donating the car. It’s a packed, packed event.", "There’s everything you could think of at the fair.

It is a bill that, among other things, would propose changes to the law governing the legal status of a child’s parents at birth, which has not been updated in nearly 40 years. We all recognize the importance of family in the development of a child, the importance of growing up with the love and guidance of parents, of having a strong and stable place to call home.", "Over the past 40 years, the value our society has placed in family has remained rock solid. But our understanding of what it means to be a family—what it means to be a parent—has evolved. Today, we recognize that there are many ways to have a family. Families can be all different shapes and sizes. There is really no right way to do it as long as at the core, the ability to love, nurture and care for a child is there.", "Our idea of what constitutes a family has changed dramatically over the past few decades. But, unfortunately, our laws haven’t always kept pace with the social evolution that has occurred. Our province’s parentage law is one such example. Last updated in 1978, our parentage law was written with a view of what it means to be a parent that is far too narrow today—definitely by today’s standards. The result is that not every family is treated the same when it comes to who is considered a legal parent.", "In fact, there are extra burdens placed on certain parents who need to use reproductive technologies to have children, meaning that sometimes they have to spend time and money to be legally recognized as a child’s parents. To give an example: If a lesbian couple uses a sperm donor whom they know to help them conceive a child, under the current law, the birth mother and the sperm donor would be the child’s parents, even if the donor had no intention of raising the child. The birth mother’s partner would potentially have to spend thousands of dollars on lawyers’ fees and take time off work to attend court dates just to be legally recognized as something she already is: a parent.", "We are fortunate to live in a time where reproductive technologies are available to help people start a family when they cannot on their own. Some couples must rely on donors to conceive, or find a surrogate to carry the child. Today, couple who use a surrogate to have a baby would not be legally recognized as the child’s parents until they are able to obtain a court order declaring them so. That could be weeks after a child is born.", "Our proposed legislation would allow the intended parents to be legally recognized as parents sooner. The couple who plan to raise the baby would not have to go through the court system, provided they have a written agreement with the surrogate before conception and the surrogate obtained independent legal advice before conception and she confirms her consent to give up her parental rights after the baby is born.", "Advancements in reproductive technologies also make it possible for a person to have their reproductive material preserved, which may then be used to conceive a child after their death. For example, a woman who was stricken with a life-threatening disease could decide to have her eggs frozen so they could be used to conceive a child at a later date with her partner. Her genetic material could be used after death to conceive a child. Under our bill, the woman would still be recognized as the mother. This is important because her child may be entitled to inherit or seek support from her estate as long as there is a written agreement between the woman and her partner and the child was born within three years of her death.", "In Ontario, we know that some families extend beyond two parents. Our courts have been approving these types of family structures for years, always with the best interests of the child at heart. Our bill would also allow up to four people to be recognized as the parents of a child, regardless of the method of conception, without a court order. All parties to the arrangements would have to agree before conception to be parents of the child together and each parent would be required to certify the birth of the child on the birth registration.", "The bottom line is that our bill allows people who have already agreed to raise a child together to be able to just that, legally, and that they can do it without having to go to court, provided there is an agreement before the baby is conceived.", "The issue of legal parentage is very complex and touches on many different areas of the law, amending 41 separate acts. Over the past few months, our government has worked very hard to develop a proposal that would not only help ensure that all parents and all kids are treated equally but also provide children with certainty about who their parents are at the earliest possible time.", "Over the summer, the ministry of the Attorney General met with various stakeholders including lawyers, families, fertility experts and members of the LGBTQ2+ community to get their input in the drafting of the bill. We worked closely with Jennifer and Kirsti Mathers McHenry, whose children Cy and Ruby were the inspiration for the private member’s bill on this exact matter. We consulted with the author of that bill, the member from Parkdale–High Park. We also drew on the work done by the Uniform Law Conference of Canada, the Manitoba Law Reform Commission and the experiences of British Columbia and Alberta, which have already introduced similar legislation in their jurisdiction. It was a tremendous effort, and I want to sincerely thank everyone for their time and dedication to this very important matter.", "Ontarians expect that all people in this province are treated equally under the law, no matter their race, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. It’s 2016, and it’s about time our laws met that expectation when it comes to recognizing parents and recognizing what it means to be a parent. We have developed a bill that will help ensure that all kids are treated equally by recognizing the legal status of their parents no matter if their parents are LGBTQ2+ or straight, or if they’re conceived with or without assistance.", "The proposed All Families Are Equal Act, if passed, would end the legal uncertainty faced by parents who conceive their children using assisted reproduction. Instead of worrying about lawyers’ fees and legal documents, those parents can get down to the really important stuff, like diaper changes and installing crib mobiles, just like any other parent and like any other family." ],

You know they won’t get a fair crack at the job market until they get a fair crack at education in Ontario, and right now, a third of a million students face an education system full of accessibility barriers.", "As I challenged in question period nine days ago, the question remains: How is it that this government could find $70 million for the defunct ORPP pension plan, $6 million for Pan Am executives and $4 million for Hydro One’s CEO but won’t put a single dollar into a successful employment office for people with disabilities or to reduce accessibility barriers in our schools, colleges and universities? Clearly, the Wynne government has not only failed to do what it promised but has actually undone some of the opportunities built over the last two decades.", "I think Mr. David Onley put it so succinctly when he said that “the unemployment rate facing people with disabilities is not only a national crisis; it is a national shame.”", "The bottom line is that the Wynne government has not done what it promised it would fix.

However, when compared to the vastly larger workload imposed on the courts by child custody, child access and child support cases, this bill forces us to evaluate the consequences it may impose.

It was followed up in 2007 by the Court of Appeal, which reiterated that it’s discriminatory, and yet the government kept fighting some 21 LGBTQ families, until April 8, 2016, when they finally ruled that the government had to do something, had to bring in a bill by September 30. They did, and kudos for that; however, there was a bill already, Cy and Ruby’s Act, that in December 2015 passed second reading with all-party approval. That could have been passed too.", "In regard to this bill—which we are delighted about, by the way, and we thank all the stakeholders who have been involved since the get-go on this—there are significant amendments that need to be made. A couple of them would be deal-breakers, and I can’t say this strongly enough. The Attorney General has given us reassurance that these amendments will be made at committee. If they are not, the government will find itself back in court with the same litigants who have already been ruled about. So I plead with the government: Please look at the amendments. They have just received them from the lawyers involved. Please make the necessary changes, because this bill is about equality—not only the equality of parents, but the equality of their children.", "In light of the concerns of my PC colleague, I have to say that not only will it not clog up the court system, it will alleviate the court system. These families already exist; whatever trials and tribulations they have already exist as well. What it will free up is all of those parents who have to go through the court system to adopt their very own children. So for the sake of our children, their parents and all of us here, I hope this is the last we see of this issue and that it’s good news for all involved." ],

As critic for municipal affairs and housing, I will be splitting my time this afternoon, my hour-long lead, with the distinguished member for Parkdale–High Park. As you know, Ms. DiNovo is the expert in this House on inclusionary zoning. She has pioneered this concept in Ontario’s Parliament. On five separate occasions she has introduced a private member’s bill on the topic. And elements of inclusionary zoning have finally found their way into a Liberal government bill.", "Speaker, I’ll mostly be speaking about other aspects of Bill 7, with the catchy title of the Promoting Affordable Housing Act. I would think by this time—after all, this is 2016, to paraphrase young Mr. Trudeau, the Prime Minister. His 2015 reference, of course, was to the effect that we are in modern times and it was high time we had an updated vision of equality. This bill is lacking in equality in a most egregious manner.", "We have in Ontario two tiers of tenants in dire need of affordable housing: those who live in buildings built since 1992, and those lucky souls fortunate enough to rent apartments in buildings that were up and occupied by the end of 1991. A previous NDP government, armed with the best of intentions, brought in rent control on the owners of apartment buildings. It established caps on annual increases, at an earlier time when we were in an affordable housing crisis. Rents were skyrocketing then. People couldn’t afford decent, safe apartments. That’s when apartment rate increases were spinning out of control. Housing Minister Dave Cooke slapped a cap of 4.6% on rent increases in 1990 and 5.4% in 1991. This infuriated the owners of apartment buildings. You may recall, Speaker, that they actually chipped in $25,000 and took out a huge ad in the Wall Street Journal warning American investors to stay clear of Ontario.", "There was a crisis then in affordable housing and there is a crisis now in affordable housing in Ontario. We wait with bated breath to see how the association representing the owners of apartment buildings will respond to this bill when we hold public hearings. So far, the Ontario Home Builders’ Association say they’re interested as long as the public sector—government—takes responsibility for the costs of delivering the units via measures, incentives, offsets and supports. They would like the government to waive the provincial portion of the HST, waive the provincial land transfer tax, provide tax credits and make low-interest loans available through Infrastructure Ontario, among other incentives. They also don’t want to pay development charges. They don’t want to provide parkland dedications or have to provide adequate parking.", "We still have a lot of work to do at committee to shape this bill into something that will be acceptable to the key players. For me, tenants and those who would be first in line for inclusionary zoning units should always be kept top of mind. These are the people struggling to get by in today’s Ontario.", "Governments have not done enough to address this issue. We haven’t been bold and we haven’t been creative. The clock has caught up to us and now is the time we took real action. Now is the time we listened, really listened, to those who live with this reality every day of their lives. Now is the time we come together, if you will, in a non-partisan way, to take the right steps towards a real solution. We’re kidding ourselves if we think we can skate around the issue of affordable housing and just go for the headlines instead of a lasting solution. Sure, it will take money, really serious money, before we can say with any confidence that we’re getting somewhere.", "Our existing stock of social housing is crumbling. The money needed for repairs and renovations is staggering. The need for subsidized housing remains great. The wait-list may never get down to a manageable size, but we have to try. The status quo just isn’t good enough anymore. We have to make every effort. We must do better than we’ve ever done before. We must accept this bill as a starting point, and we must work hard to make it better.", "The New Democrats in this House are prepared to roll up our sleeves and get at it. We’re prepared to take this bill around the province to meet those most in need of affordable housing on their own turf. They can’t afford to come to Toronto. If ever there was a bill that a committee needed to hear about from the stakeholders in every corner of the province, this is it. I hope the Wynne Liberals see it that way.", "Affordable housing is much more than just a downtown Toronto issue. Show the people in this province you are finally ready to listen and to take action. Show them you’re making affordable housing the priority it should have been, like it was back in the early 1990s.", "As I was saying, back in the day the NDP government stepped in, showed real leadership and cooled off an out-of-control rental housing market. The problem since then is that neither the Conservatives nor the Liberals have shown that same sort of leadership when it comes to affordable rental housing.", "The rent control formula in Ontario is woefully out of date. It hasn’t been addressed in this bill. It hasn’t been updated. Once again, we are in crisis when it comes to a lack of affordable housing in this province.", "As I said, this is 2016. Surely the Wynne government, a government that came in with so much promise—Premier Wynne was going to be different. Premier Wynne is not showing the kind of leadership we were told to expect.", "This bill, Bill 7, has the opportunity to bring affordable housing into this century. Think about it for a moment—this century. It stagnated in 1991, in the last century. It’s unacceptable that tenants aren’t treated the same. We shouldn’t have a two-tiered system of tenant housing. At the very least, I say to the members of the Wynne government, if you won’t do the right thing, at least take some baby steps. Don’t ignore the problem altogether.", "Change this bill so that buildings built since 2001, in this century, are covered by rent control. Then make sure that every year in the future, we update the rent control provisions so that in 2017, for example, buildings built in 2002 are covered under rent control, and in 2018, buildings since 2003 are covered, and so on.", "That’s leadership lite, but at least it’s taking baby steps towards equality. That’s bringing affordable rent legislation into this century, not ignoring the problem and keeping it stashed and locked up in the past century. Such an update could be seen as a bit of a Liberal vision of equality. I mean, after all, this is 2016.", "Our new housing minister must be full of the devil. I say that because of the old political idiom, “The devil is in the details.” Right now, there are not a lot of details known beyond the ministerial level about this bill because so much of it is being left up to regulations. But on the surface, it looks to be an okay piece of legislation—just okay—but it’s lacking substantive information.", "For example, there is some debate yet to be held over the issue of development fees on what we know as secondary units, granny flats or basement apartments—a rose by any other name. The way it’s written, municipalities would be prevented from charging development fees on those secondary units. Now, they’re not happy about that. We’ll hear from AMO, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, when this bill gets to committee. They will be seeking a compromise on this provision.", "By way of a short history, back in the early days of the last NDP government, homeowners who wanted to help with the affordable housing crisis had a real friend at Queen’s Park. Partners are required if we are ever to get out of this crisis that we face these days. But back then, New Democrats gave homeowners who wanted to provide secondary housing units the right to do so, regardless of existing municipal zoning plans.", "Speaker, as an aside, as you know, many of my friends and neighbours in Windsor–Tecumseh and Lakeshore are struggling these days to clean up after the sudden and torrential rainfall that nailed us last week. Several thousand basements were under water. Many of them were finished with carpeting and expensive furniture, and many of those belongings are now waterlogged, trashed and sitting curbside, waiting for the special pickups we’ve been promised.", "I’ve heard loss estimates as high as $50,000. Some of my neighbours had insurance and some didn’t. Some cancelled their insurance a few years ago because we’ve never had a problem with water. Our sump pumps rarely, if ever, kicked in. We got complacent. Then last week, Mother Nature snuck up on us and kicked us in the pants big time.", "I want to thank the Minister of Municipal Affairs and the Premier for their help in our recovery efforts. Windsor mayor Drew Dilkens and the mayor of Tecumseh, Gary McNamara, declared a state of emergency last Thursday afternoon. Lakeshore wasn’t hit as hard, but Mayor Tom Bain knew he’d be able to tag on to any provincial assistance because of the severity of the damage.", "Minister Mauro toured the area yesterday and agreed with the state-of-emergency assessment. Homeowners can now apply for provincial funding from two disaster relief programs. Those who qualified won’t get everything they’ve lost back, but the programs at least give many a glimmer of hope for a brighter, drier future.", "But this raises a weakness in our disaster relief assistance program, and that’s because residents who were flooded with stormwater can apply for assistance, but if combined sewers backed up and you were flooded with raw sewage from sanitary sewers, you’re not eligible under existing laws. This is unfair. An act of God is an act of God, and as far as I know, God doesn’t play favourites, so we should change the legislation so everyone who is flooded during a proclaimed state-of-emergency natural disaster is covered and eligible for provincial assistance.", "Getting back to Bill 7, when it comes to social housing, our buildings are not in the best of shape. In some cases, they’re actually crumbling. The cost to renovate or replace the stock of subsidized housing is enormous. The bill could do so much more on this front.", "The Harris Conservative government downloaded the cost of providing social housing to municipal taxpayers. There was little or no money provided for maintaining the housing stock. Municipal mayors have been fighting ever since for those costs to be uploaded and put back into provincial budgets.", "Just here in Toronto, the city needs nearly $3 billion just to repair the social housing units provided by the city, the Toronto Community Housing developments. They’ve budgeted for and spent more than $600 million already on renovations, but need the Liberals in Toronto and Ottawa to step up to the plate. They don’t need nickels and dimes, Speaker, they need real dough, serious money for a serious issue.", "We face a crisis in affordable housing. More than 170,000 families across Ontario are waiting in line for affordable housing. That waiting list isn’t going away anytime soon. I think it’s great that the new Minister of Housing has introduced this bill. I’ll tell you, he has big shoes to fill as he replaces the member for Ancaster–Dundas–Flamborough–Westdale, the former minister. And he has some serious lobbying to do because, as I recall, the last Wynne Liberal budget cut $20 million out of the ministry’s budget. One would think that with this new emphasis on affordable housing, money would be pouring into the ministry and not being taken away.", "There is a scary aspect to this bill, Speaker, and it has to do with the future of social housing agencies. Take the city of Windsor and Essex county, for example. Social housing in my region is the responsibility of the CHC, the community housing corporation. This bill gives those responsible for social housing the ability to sell or transfer housing projects without the permission of the minister. No longer do these service managers need the minister’s approval to merge, dissolve or sell their social housing agencies. This opens the door for municipalities to finally get out of the social housing business if they want to do that—at least that’s the way it appears without knowing all of the details in the bill. I find that scary because, in public hands, rents were controlled, geared to income in many cases and, for the most part, affordable. What happens if those units are sold, fixed up a bit and rented out at new rates which are no longer as affordsable? I guess we know the answer: The name of the bill could be changed to Promoting Unaffordable Housing Act.", "There is nothing in here to protect tenants from renovictions. That’s when landlords seek above-guideline rent increases to recover the costs of unnecessary repairs or other questionable expenditures, and when you can’t pay the new rates, you’re evicted.", "Likewise, this bill is silent on what is known as economic evictions: when rent increases are used as a weapon to get rid of tenants who are deemed difficult because they question standards in the building or they demand that the landlord uphold minimum safety or maintenance standards.", "There’s a controversy, Speaker, in many neighbourhoods over group homes. At question is the distinction between people who are related as opposed to people who are not related. Lodging homes, or group homes, house people who are not related but who are still in need of safe, affordable housing. On the other hand, many large, extended families living in what otherwise would be called a group home are considered acceptable. They may be brothers with families, lots of kids, cousins, aunts and uncles and a grandmother or two grandfathers. This kind of living arrangement is okay in some areas, but if the residents are not related—and this happens, as you know, in college and university towns a lot—city planners say such homes are not allowed. The Ontario Human Rights Commission has a different view, and there is often conflict. These homes still have to comply with noise bylaws, parking bylaws and the storage of garbage and so on, but this bill doesn’t do anything to strengthen planning and zoning in such situations.", "Speaker, there is an advocacy centre for tenants in Ontario. The centre’s director is Kenn Hale. He does not believe that there should be bylaws that say it’s all right for two families of five to live in a structure but 10 unrelated people, each with their own room, cannot live there. This is so-called “people zoning.” It has no place in Ontario, according to Mr. Hale.", "Let’s get into rent control, which this bill ignores. Former NDP leader Stephen Lewis, during a minority Conservative government in 1979, forced Premier Bill Davis to bring in the first Residential Tenancies Act. Earlier, I mentioned my friend Dave Cooke, who used to represent my riding. Mr. Cooke put a cap on rent increases during a previous crisis in affordable housing. Then the Mike Harris Conservative government stripped away many of the restrictions on landlords. Tenants lost the protections as the Conservatives introduced what they called “vacancy decontrol.” That allowed landlords to raise the rents to whatever they wanted, whatever the market would bear, once a tenant left a unit. It also exempted buildings first occupied in November 1991 or later from rent increase guidelines. These provisions are still in effect.", "Speaker, I know you’ll get a kick out of this, but I want to turn back the clock a bit and give you a quote from former Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty. I know we don’t hear his name mentioned very much these days in this hall, but Dalton McGuinty had an interest in rent control. In fact, while he was on the campaign trail in 2003, on his way to the Premier’s office, Mr. McGuinty was looking for votes and he said, “I want to be clear about our plan for rent control. We will repeal the Harris-Eves government’s Tenant Protection Act and we will bring back real rent control that protects tenants from excessive rent increases. We will get rid of vacancy decontrol that allows unlimited rent increases on a unit when a tenant leaves.”", "Well, Speaker, we have yet another example of a broken Liberal promise. They will say anything to get elected, just like how they wouldn’t raise our taxes or sell hydro. Then, once in office, this political amnesia sets in and they have no memory. Heck, they’ll even erase their memory sticks and their computer hard drives when it suits their purpose.", "We have the opportunity with this bill. Let’s not allow the broken promises of the Liberal past to weigh us down. Show us you really do have a plan. Show us you really do believe in equality. Show the people living in apartment buildings in Toronto and elsewhere that you are doing something to make their lives more affordable. We know the association that represents landlords is one of your biggest funders, but come on. This should be about what’s best for the everyday people of Ontario, not the richest people. They have their own expensive housing to call home. We need to look after those who are just scraping by, trying to hold on to a safe place to live and raise a family—a warm place to live, an affordable place to live.", "When this bill goes to committee, I hope we hear from the people who rent apartments and who worry whether they’ll be able to continue to stay where they are. Yes, we do have many good—even great—landlords in Ontario. We should be very proud of them, and I am. But there are too many horror stories out there about unscrupulous landlords; the slumlords, if you will, those who gouge their tenants, don’t fix up their units, don’t maintain them and don’t do enough to get rid of pests—the bugs, the rats, the mice—and those who allow their commercial garbage bins to overflow, and don’t mow the lawn or fix broken windows or doors.", "We can do so much better with this bill. If you want to own an apartment building in Ontario and rent it out to tenants, you should have an obligation to maintain your property to the highest standards.", "The minister spoke the other day about the CHPI program. Four years ago, the Liberal government eliminated the Community Start Up and Maintenance Benefit and folded it into something called the Community Homelessness Prevention Initiative, CHPI, but they did the changeover with less money, less funding. Funding to municipalities is capped; it’s not demand-based. Benefits are discretionary and people are prevented from appealing a denial of benefits to the Social Benefits Tribunal.", "In March 2015, the Wynne Liberals slapped a two-year funding freeze on the CHPI program. The program has helped some of those most in need, but it could have done so much more. It could have been a boost to the other people who needed the money, and they didn’t make the money available.", "We recently gave second reading to a private member’s bill to proclaim Hazel McCallion Day in Ontario. On page 202 of her book, Hurricane Hazel: A Life With Purpose, the former mayor of Mississauga says, “Affordable housing is quickly moving out of reach for a large number of Canadians. Where I live has one of the longest wait-lists for subsidized housing in the country. For years, we’ve been asking the federal government to adopt and implement a national housing strategy to alleviate the problem.”", "Speaker, Hurricane Hazel speaks her mind. She goes on to say that “property tax was never intended to be paying for such things as social housing. These are important issues and they won’t get solved without some bold and creative thinking from the upper governments.” I couldn’t agree more, Speaker, and that’s partially why I’m disappointed with what I’ve seen in this bill so far, without seeing so many of the details that should be in there. As I said at the beginning, the devil will be in the details, because so far there’s not a lot of bold creative ideas coming forward from the Wynne government with this bill.", "The other day—last Wednesday morning, actually—Minister Ballard introduced this bill to the House. He referenced the member from London North Centre and something she said at a conference on homelessness last year. She, according to Minister Ballard, said, “If home is where the heart is, where is the heart of a homeless person?” I replied then that the heart of the homeless rests here, among the NDP caucus, the representatives of the poor, the downtrodden, the impoverished, the homeless—the very people who have been ignored by successive Conservative and Liberal governments for the past 25 years.", "A long time ago, back in the days of the Rae government, a rent registry was established. That enabled easy access to information. If you were thinking about renting in a certain neighbourhood, you could consult the registry and see what the market rent—the average rent—was in the area you were looking at. Then you knew if what you were being asked to pay was reasonable or not. The bill is silent on such a registry, which clearly would be yet another tool in the workbench as we search for ways to build more affordable housing choices in Ontario.", "We have an affordable housing statement, and “affordable” means, when it applies to rental housing, “a unit for which the rent does not exceed 30% of gross annual household income” or “a unit for which the rent is at or below the average market rent” in the region.", "When it comes to homes, “affordable” comes into play when “housing for which the purchase price results in annual accommodation costs which do not exceed 30% of gross annual household income for low and moderate income households; or housing for which the purchase price is at least 10% below the average purchase price of a resale unit” in the region.", "This bill does make it mandatory for municipalities to do an inventory on their homeless population, and that’s a good thing. Of course, as usual, the Liberals haven’t put any money into this bill for the municipal governments to carry out the surveys. It won’t be easy. Municipalities run lean. They don’t have staff hanging around with nothing to do so that you can just send them out to look for anyone who looks homeless. And so far there’s nothing in the bill that says those survey reports would ever even be released to the public, Speaker.", "People living at the bottom or the low end of income distribution have much more at stake in the discussion on affordable housing. For them, the issue is far more serious than for the rest of us. Many of them live, as you know, paycheque to paycheque. If there is a disruption in that pay or an illness, an accident or an unexpected expense, the very next step could well be homelessness. Unexpected increases in a hydro bill, for example, could put some people over the edge, over that tipping point; and we have certainly heard a lot in this chamber lately when it comes to high hydro bills.", "The bill will help us perhaps get a better handle on the real issue of homelessness in Ontario. If the surveys are accurate—and I know it’s always difficult to enumerate the homeless population—maybe it will help us determine all of the reasons for this crisis and maybe it will lead us into a more informed direction as we work to resolve the issues as best we can.", "We need all of the partners in the housing industry to step up to the plate and accept some responsibility for the mess we’re in. We need to work with them as partners and offer incentives to get more affordable housing units built.", "Homebuilders—people who own and build apartment buildings—aren’t the bad guys here. They can do more to help us out here, yes, but they’re not the bad guys. We need to work with them as equal partners. Well, maybe some more equal than others, but they need incentives to get them interested. They can’t be expected to pay out of their pockets to resolve our mutual problem on their own.", "There are a number of tools at our disposal: tax credits, development fees, dedicated parkland, off-site units, co-operative housing. I’m sure Ms. DiNovo will be touching on some of these aspects when she turns her attention to the inclusionary zoning aspects of this bill.", "Speaker, I just mentioned co-operative housing. As many of you know, we’ve been waiting for some time now for word from Ottawa on renewing their Ontario co-op rent supplements. Co-op federal operating agreements will end within two years unless a more permanent agreement can be reached. If not, 7,000 low-income households are at risk of joining the affordable housing crisis in Ontario.", "Ontario has an obligation—the Liberals could do so. They could indicate in this bill that they will encourage their federal Liberal cousins to get serious about this situation. Here in Ontario we have 125,000 people who are proud to call a housing co-operative their home.", "As I said at the beginning of my hour-long statement, I will be dividing my time equally with the member for Parkdale–High Park. Ms. DiNovo is the champion of inclusionary zoning. She has introduced five private member’s bills on the subject. Two passed second reading, were allowed to languish in committee and finally, finally we’re at the point where there are inclusionary zoning aspects in this bill.", "I would now turn the floor over to the member from Parkdale–High Park." ],

He gave a lengthy and very well-thought-out examination of the bill before us and also really paved the way for my comments.", "I want to thank, also, the new minister of not only housing but the minister responsible for the Poverty Reduction Strategy. It’s true that housing truly is absolutely essential if we’re going to tackle the issue of poverty.", "I had the great good fortune, I guess, to attend the Toronto Housing Summit last week. It was organized by Mayor John Tory. Looking around that auditorium that was very well covered by the media, I saw just about every housing activist that there was to be had in the city of Toronto and even beyond Toronto, people I hadn’t seen in years and some I see frequently, some like Cathy Crowe, a very well-known street nurse whose activism goes back to the days in 1981 when it was declared that Toronto had a national disaster—talking about national disasters—and it was called homelessness.", "Now, the sad reality is that homelessness is worse now than it was back in 1981. The waiting lists for affordable housing are longer by far than they were back then. The availability of affordable housing is worse than it was back then. Arguably, poverty—in fact, not arguably; factually, poverty has gone up significantly since then, including child poverty. Really, the disaster is now. We live in a disaster, certainly in Toronto, in terms of affordable housing.", "I was amazed at that summit how polite everybody was, because I’ve been through so many meetings on housing and poverty over the years and so little has been delivered by both this government and the government previously that really that should have been an angry mob. I was amazed that they weren’t angry, that they weren’t throwing things at the federal minister and the provincial minister and the city officials. City officials do what they can. I’ll give them a break on this one because, as you heard from the member from Windsor–Tecumseh speaking before me, municipalities and cities have very, very little to spend on affordable housing. Really, what they’re looking at is property taxes. You cannot build a housing strategy on property taxes, nor would you want to.", "Absolutely, we need a national housing strategy. We’ve yet to see one. We need one. But we also need provincial action. Now, it was at that same housing summit that the housing minister announced that this government had spent $4 billion since 2003 on affordable housing—$1.2 billion in the city of Toronto. I can tell you that that sounds like a lot of money until you think about it for a minute, because when you look at the budget of this government since 2003 to the present, every year being over a hundred billion—usually $120 billion to $130 billion every year—$4 billion is very, very little. It’s infinitesimal. Certainly, $1.2 billion for the city of Toronto, the largest city in Canada, is a drop in the bucket. In fact, it’s a slap in the face to Toronto. John Tory, who, as you know, is no Liberal, said as much and asked for more help.", "Now, here we have a bill, as the member said, dealing with inclusionary zoning, and I’m going to circle back to it for a minute because people who are watching this might not know what that means. What “inclusionary zoning” means, to give an example, is to allow the municipalities, which they can’t right now, to ask of developers that—and this is just an example—if they build over 50 units, say a condo tower or even a new build in the suburbs, 50 units, that 10%, let’s say, be set aside for affordable housing. That can look very different in different municipalities. It can be rent-to-own, for example, or it could be just affordable rental.", "That’s the idea, the end result of which would be something like what we have, the gold standard—by the way, not only in Toronto but the gold standard in Ontario and, arguably, in Canada—like St. Lawrence Market. I actually say, go see St. Lawrence Market, because there you won’t notice the difference between market-priced housing, co-ops and Toronto Community Housing—affordable housing. They’re all mixed together. That is the gold standard. It’s a great place to live for everyone who lives there. You can’t tell the difference between who has money and who doesn’t—and it works. And guess what? To be non-partisan about it, it was done under Conservatives: a Conservative mayor, a Conservative Premier.", "So it can be done, it has been done, but it really hasn’t been done since the 1970s. Perhaps Regent Park, but even Regent Park isn’t as broad a base of affordable housing as St. Lawrence Market. So we know it can be done. We know mixed-use housing is this the way to go. It’s the best way to go for everyone. For the children too, by the way, who live there, who aren’t just with children of their own economic bracket but who are with children from all economic brackets. That’s what inclusionary zoning does.", "But here’s the interesting thing: It doesn’t cost anything. It doesn’t cost anything for taxpayers. It doesn’t cost anything. So why has it taken almost 10 years in this House, five tablings and a second reading to get it to this point?", "Again, to go back to what it is, all it is, is asking developers to set aside a certain number of units. And, by the way, it’s good for them too, because in a rising market like Toronto, which won’t last forever, by the way—I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that which goes up tends to level off and sometimes come down. I’ve lived in one of those downturns. If you remember, in the early 1990s, in condo development—I knew many people that invested in condos. Sound familiar? Those who invested in condos as investments had to hold on to those “investments” for sometimes 20, 30 years before they saw their money out. They had to wait for the next sweep going up. Meanwhile, they were paying more in many cases to keep holding onto those investments than the investments themselves were worth.", "So we have seen downturns, especially in the condo market in our cities in Ontario. We’ve seen that happen. When that happens, this is good news for developers because then you’ve got units that will not sell that you can bring some money in on. It’s good news. It’s also good news for developers in this sense: Right now in Toronto, it’s almost impossible for young people to get into the housing market. It’s virtually impossible. The best can you get is a tiny condo, and that’s on two salaries. If you allow affordable units in condo developments, for example, you also allow young people—say it’s rent-to-own—to actually get into the market. That is then the next generation of those who can sell and buy. Otherwise, you’re not seeding the market for your developments. So it’s good for development, it’s good for developers and it’s also good—most importantly—for those who desperately need housing. As I say, it can look very different depending on the municipality.", "Until this bill passes, until we get inclusionary zoning, you can’t have that happen. This is important to note. We need a change in the Planning Act, and that’s what this bill does. It gives that change in the Planning Act, which we desperately need, so that a city like Toronto—which, by the way, under David Miller, voted for my bill, among many other municipalities—can then bring in inclusionary zoning requirements and not get taken to the OMB and defeated there. We need this, and cities need this.", "Now, to the case of Toronto: I want to deal with section 37 dollars, because I see a former councillor, the member from Scarborough–Rouge River, sitting here, among others. He will know what I’m talking about when I talk about section 37 dollars. In this bill, for some strange reason—it wasn’t in my bill—there’s an either/or clause: either inclusionary zoning or section 37; you can’t have both. It’s a direct dig at Toronto and Toronto’s city council. Why? I put that in this bill. I objected even at the time. I understand the reasoning and have great regard for the former Minister of Housing, Ted McMeekin, but this was not necessary.", "I’ll tell you why it’s a problem and why we will be bringing in an amendment, based on what we hear from our city councillors in Toronto. You need some flexibility. Yes, we want the city to bring in inclusionary zoning. We want all of our municipalities to have that tool and to be able to use that tool, particularly in Toronto, where the need is arguably the greatest. We want that tool and we want to get municipalities to use that tool. But you also need a little bit of flexibility around having that tool. You need maybe some structure around those developments. You need maybe some parking. I hate saying parking, because we have too much of it in one sense. We want to be a car-free Toronto. But you need some infrastructure at times, and the city needs money to provide that infrastructure for development. So you want some flexibility there. Not that it should be simply a situation where, as it is now, a councillor’s negotiating ability with the developers in their riding is all; no, we need affordable housing. We don’t need another fountain in a park, or whatever else that section 37 money could be used for. We need housing.", "Our councillors have asked for it, I think they deserve it, and I think they need some flexibility with, again, the focus—not the boot—on the fact that inclusionary zoning is really what we need to get us there.", "By my reckoning, by our research reckoning, not by Jennifer Keesmaat’s—I beg to differ with her on this one; she was looking at very, very high levels of opting out. But let’s just say, to take my example at the top, 50 units, 10% of those 50 units: If this government had passed my inclusionary zoning bill when it was first tabled and first went through second reading, if the city of Toronto and the rest of Ontario had had that tool since then, in about 10 years there would be about 120,000 new units of affordable housing available right now, and not one tax dollar being spent, because that’s how much development has taken place in Ontario in the last 10 years. So if we actually had brought it in back then at a very low level—at 10% of developments over 50 units—the effect would have been staggering. We wouldn’t have 170,000 families waiting for affordable housing, some for 10 to 12 years—that’s the average. We would have actually housed many of them.", "That’s what it can provide—not only what it can provide, but what it is providing in some 200 jurisdictions across North America. In fact, arguably, if the United States and individual states did not have inclusionary zoning, there would be very little affordable housing anywhere in the United States. Most of the states have used this tool because it doesn’t cost tax dollars. That’s what’s so appealing about it. It has been used everywhere, including throughout Europe. London, England, for example, one of the most expensive jurisdictions in the world, has inclusionary zoning on the books.", "To get back to the housing issue generally, when I was first elected, I was the housing critic. I remember sitting in committee with the then housing minister, John Gerretsen—who was a lovely man, and kudos to him. He was very honest. I remember asking him about the state of affordability and the absolute disgrace of homelessness in Ontario, one of the wealthiest places to live in the world and yet we still have this national disaster on our hands. I said, “If you look at the cost of keeping someone in a shelter—think about this—the staff involved, the money it costs to keep that shelter going, by our estimation, our research—not ours alone—it’s around $100-plus a night. That’s staggering. That’s ridiculous. You can get a hotel room for that.”", "And he admitted it. He said at committee—it’s in Hansard—“Yes, you’re right.” So I said, “What is the problem then? Why are we paying all of this money out of this place to keep people ill-housed, precariously housed and homeless? Because it’s costing us money. It’s not free. It’s costing us money to keep people homeless, precariously housed and ill-housed. It’s costing us money. Why is all this money going out when we can’t, first of all, do builds”—remember builds, when governments used to be in the business of actually providing new housing?—“new builds, real rent controls—anything, really? Why can’t we do that?”", "He kind of shrugged his shoulders. I’ll tell you why we can’t do this, Mr. Speaker, and why we can’t do a number of other social service programs we need in this province, like child care et al., but certainly why we can’t do housing that costs money up front—yes, new builds cost money up front; there’s no question about it. It’s because of the election cycle; that’s why. Because $100 a night in a shelter, just treading water and keeping the status quo going, keeping people precariously housed—keeping people poor, quite frankly, because without good housing, you never escape poverty—the money that it takes, the billions it costs every year to keep people poor, precariously housed, homeless, ill-housed etc., and also factoring in, of course, health costs, justice costs and everything—it’s expensive to keep poverty at the rate we have it at in Ontario. So why do we pay that money, but we won’t pay the money to fix the problem? Because it requires a lot of money up front.", "But guess what? You see the return down the way. It may take five or 10 years to see that return, but you see it. You see it in increased job prospects from construction. You see it in lessened costs in terms of health care, in terms the justice system etc. You see the money back. Just like child care; Quebec has proven that. When you subsidize child care, yes, it costs a lot of money up front, but you see the money back when—guess what?—women start working and paying taxes. It’s the same for poverty. When people get jobs, because they have a house, because they have education, you see the money back, but it requires political will, and political will is sadly in short supply on the other side of the aisle.", "So that’s why we don’t put money into housing, even though it costs more to keep people ill-housed, precariously housed and on affordable housing wait-lists. That’s the sad reality, and that’s why I wonder why those people at that Toronto housing summit weren’t really angry, why they politely clapped.", "This Thursday I think ISARC is coming again. They’re a group of faith leaders, always with poverty as their focus. They’ve come every year since I’ve been here—10 years—and every year they politely clap when they hear us all, each party, stand up and speak to them, even though homelessness is getting worse, ill-housing and the wait-list are growing, and poverty is increasing. Don’t be nice. That’s a message for someone watching from the housing community and the poverty action community: Don’t be nice. “Nice” is a four-letter word in this place, Mr. Speaker. Don’t be nice.", "It’s a calamity that we’re looking at in this province. It’s a national disaster. It’s worse than it was in 1981 when it was declared so. It’s still bad now. So inclusionary zoning will help. Yes, it will, if it’s done right. And there’s no question that we have amendments to make to this bill about how to do it right.", "The member from Windsor–Tecumseh also mentioned the problem with bad landlords. We’re not talking about good landlords; we’re talking about bad landlords here. Another bill that I introduced many years back was for landlord licensing. I don’t know if we all remember the bedbug crisis. Guess what? It didn’t go away. It’s still there. There are still people living in places that are bedbug-infested. Nothing really has changed; it just fell off the media radar.", "I have about 90% tenants in the south part of one of the parts of my riding, in Parkdale, and up till recently, there were about 10,000 affordable, privately held units available there. We’re losing those due to gentrification, because we don’t have, as the member said, real rent control; we have vacancy decontrol. Despite the promises of the former Premier, Dalton McGuinty, to bring it in in 2003, we still don’t have it 13 years later. So what happens when a tenant moves out is that the rent gets jacked up. This is happening right across the city of Toronto; hence, we’re losing affordable housing units—and that’s not even talking about the Airbnb reality and the shared economy. We are losing affordable rental units across our province, and we need to react to that in some way because that’s going to swell yet again—that 170,000 families who are waiting for affordable housing.", "The landlord licensing concept is very clear: If you don’t make the necessary repairs that the municipality has said you should make, you don’t get your licence renewed to rent again. How simple can that be? It doesn’t even need to cost very much for a licence. It’s a source of revenue for the municipalities. But there’s a lobby against that. If you think this is very pie in the sky, I want to tell you that there are jurisdictions that do it way better—way better. We don’t even have to invent this. We just have to put into place what other jurisdictions have already done around housing.", "I had the great good fortune about six years ago to travel to Sweden. I needed some good news. It’s not just Sweden, Mr. Speaker—it’s actually all of Scandinavia and a lot of western Europe—but let’s focus on Sweden because that’s where I went. Sweden is a country of nine million people. Right now, we have 13 million in Ontario and counting. So they’re much smaller than we are and it’s a smaller tax base than we have, yet somehow they managed to build 100,000 new units of housing a year for 10 years. They called it their Million housing program. Think about that. They don’t have a housing problem in Sweden. In fact, they don’t have a poverty problem in Sweden. Is all poverty abolished? No, it’s not, but everyone has a house; everybody has the essentials. What do the essentials look like? Free post-secondary; free child care, more or less; dental care; pharma care; all the things that we in the NDP would like to see for all Canadians. We’d like to see for all Canadians, as Tommy Douglas said, what we’d like to see for ourselves. They already have that. They have that not just in Sweden and around Scandinavia, but throughout western Europe. So it can be done. It simply can be done, if there’s political will to do it. It exists. It exists out there.", "I want to give a shout-out, before I forget, to Parkdale legal in the Parkdale side of my Parkdale–High Park riding. They have done phenomenal work for tenants for many, many years. I would strongly advise all members here, if they have a legal aid clinic that works with tenants, to go talk to them. They’ll tell you what it’s like to go to landlord-tenant tribunals, to fight on behalf of their clients who are evicted for all sorts of ridiculous reasons—where repairs are not done.", "I remember visiting one lady—she was in her nineties at the time—who lived on the top floor of an eight-storey building in South Parkdale where the elevator, the one elevator, kept going out of service. When the elevator went out of service, she couldn’t get out of her apartment and she couldn’t go anywhere.", "She’s in her early nineties and she lives on the top floor. She told her landlord that there was a leak in the ceiling of the apartment. I happened to be there with Mary Hynes. I remember it very well from CBC. She was tootling around with me for some reason—it had nothing to do with housing—and we knocked on her door. I think that I was out canvassing, and she just decided to tag along. We knocked on this lady’s door, and she showed me what the landlord had done in response to her complaint. There was literally a tube running from the hole in the roof into a bucket. That was the response of her landlord.", "When I talked to my city councillor, who I have a great deal of time for, he said, “Yes, the same landlord”—there were multiple citations against this landlord. But he said, “There’s nothing more we can do. We just keep slapping him with more and more citations, and he keeps ignoring them.”", "That’s the situation for tenants who are lucky enough to have a place right now—not for all of them; of course, there are good landlords. But there has to be some mechanism to deal with that. That mechanism is certainly not in this bill.", "The member from Windsor–Tecumseh raised another very troubling thing—and I want to spend a few minutes on it—and that is about, for example, in Toronto, Toronto Community Housing. Toronto Community Housing, as he said, has a $3-billion shortfall for repairs. When you think back to that $4 billion over 13 years, with the $1.2 billion for Toronto, you can see what chicken feed it is, because here you have just our social housing being behind $3 billion.", "But the answer is not to privatize it. The answer is not to give it away, because then what do all those people who live there do? Where do they go, those who waited 10 to 12 years to get one of those units? Well, it looks like the government is allowing municipalities to even think about that. And then what? Give them a rent supplement that they could take to go where? And find what? I can tell you that in the city of Toronto it would have to be quite the rent supplement to afford any of those market rents—certainly not anything any Toronto Community Housing person I know could afford. Then again, even if it was affordable, privately held housing, what’s to stop the landlord from increasing the rent just to meet the rent supplement?", "You see, it’s a problem. Community housing is like any other community asset. You’ve heard us talk about Ontario Hydro. Housing is a valuable asset, especially in the city of Toronto. What it would cost to replace it is astronomical, but we need to keep it in good repair so that people can live there safely, or we will lose it, one way or another.", "That’s something, again, that’s not even really dealt with here. What’s dealt with is giving municipalities, sadly, the incentive, in a sense, to just get rid of it and just sell it. We saw what happened in England when Margaret Thatcher tried to do that. Remember that she sold community housing? “It’s yours for a dollar,” to people who live there. That was lost forever. Good luck for the people who got it; bad luck for the next umpteen generations, because there it was: social housing gone. So I would hope that on the Liberal side they wouldn’t repeat the same kind of mindset that Margaret Thatcher had when she did that and to keep valuable community assets like our affordable housing in our communities.", "So yes, we need that and, yes, finally, we need inclusionary zoning, we need real rent control and we need landlord licensing. We need a lot of tools in the toolbox to address the issue of housing, and—dare we dream?—we also need new builds. In fact, going back a few elections, it was part of our platform: 10,000 new units of affordable housing built. We need new building going on. We need construction. It’s good for everyone. It’s good for the construction unions and it’s good for the people who live in the units. And much as it’s hats off to Habitat for Humanity, they can only do so much with very, very little. We need a massive government response. I know it’s never going to be what it was in Sweden and in Europe, many with humongous housing projects—which, by the way, completely fed into and spurred their economies—but at least we need some nod in that direction. New bills, rent controls, inclusionary zoning and landlord licensing: These are all that we need. It’s not rocket science. It’s very simple.", "And if the government did it, if they put the money in now, they would save money in the future. Have the political will.

Certainly if your education is paid for, your child care or your home is paid for, you have an 85% unionization rate—which they also have—if your dental care is paid for, standards are a little bit different over there. Suffice to say that when the Swedish social service folk came from their government here and did a tour—I was one of the ones who met them at that point because I was social services critic, and that was just a couple of years back. One of our folk asked them where they’d like to tour. Would they like to go to a food bank?

Inclusionary zoning has been opposed for many years by different groups, different municipalities. They say, “No, no. We can’t have inclusionary zoning.” I suppose there’s still going to be a lot of people against this legislation because they don’t like the idea of including affordable housing in legislation.", "What this does is it gives municipalities the tools, if they want to, to use affordable housing as part of the approval process for development approvals. Again, this is something that’s been opposed for many years. I commend the minister for finally taking this strong step which has been long advocated by people who’ve been seeking more opportunity to include affordable housing in the building that is taking place. There is a building explosion that’s taking place in some parts of this province and some parts of the country. The missing ingredients in the building explosion are affordable housing components.", "This bill will give that opportunity to municipalities, if they so choose—not all municipalities will choose to include inclusionary zoning because there’s a different housing reality in different parts of Ontario. The reality of Toronto, the reality of Ottawa or Barrie is much different than the demand for housing and the supply of affordable housing in smaller communities. Whether it be Cornwall or North Bay, there are different housing markets. That’s why there’s flexibility in this legislation which allows municipalities who feel they can use this tool to pass this legislation.", "It is a very, very important step.

I really think it is an important, strong step, but it’s not going to go unchallenged because, as I’ve said, historically, there have been many people against it.", "In terms of housing, I know that in cities like Toronto or Vancouver or Barrie, there are immense pressures to find adequate housing. One of these huge pressures is the result of the continual influx of new people that want to live in cities like Toronto or want to live in cities like Barrie. You’re almost a victim of your own success as a city. Every year, I think there are about 50,000 to 100,000 people who move into Toronto, non-stop; 50,000 to 100,000 people come into the Toronto/GTA area every year from immigration, from other parts of Canada. So that pressure never stops. If you’re in Prince Edward Island or New Brunswick or Halifax, that never happens. But in the GTA and in Greater Vancouver, this never stops. It is not easy for municipalities or provincial governments to provide housing instantaneously because, as you try to house the people that came in last year, you’ve got another 50,000 to 100,000 people coming next year. It never stops. So you can imagine how difficult it is.", "It’s amazing that, in the ranking of cities—I saw another ranking today that said that Toronto is the second-best place in the world to live in. Despite all its warts and all its, you might say, challenges, people still want to live in Canadian cities. So we have to provide very innovative approaches to this.", "One innovation that I’ve talked about to Minister Ballard: I said that I know the former director of planning in the city of Toronto used to talk about main street development. In our main streets in Toronto, Mr. Speaker—if you take a walk along Bloor Street from the Don River all the way out to Scarborough, you’ll see that most of Bloor Street where there’s a major subway there are two-storey buildings and one-storey buildings. The question is, why not allow—God forbid—three-storey buildings on main streets, or four-storey buildings? Or we could go over the moon and have six-storey buildings on our main streets. We already have public transit on our main streets; we already have stores and libraries.", "Nowadays in Toronto, one of the best things that has happened, actually, is that a lot of people that have come into our city, a lot of young people, don’t even own a car. They ride-share; they are cyclists. A lot of people who live on our main streets don’t want a place to park their car because they don’t own a car.", "We should invite people to live on our main streets. Many of them would want to live on our main streets, but right now, the way the local bylaws are, it’s almost impossible for a property owner on a main street to get the approvals to do more than two storeys. So we go along, block after block, on our main arterials—even Yonge Street, which is part of my riding. You’ll see, if you go up Yonge Street, except for the nodes at the corners of Eglinton and Yonge, there are still one-storey buildings all the way up Yonge Street.", "Why not allow them to have, as of right—God forbid—three storeys, as of right. No; they have to go through all kinds of planning applications and rezoning, so most property owners say, “What’s the use? I’ll just sit on the property and let the capital value appreciate. I’m not going to try to build another storey.” That would be one thing that could be helpful in allowing, as of right, three-storey buildings on our main streets, where municipalities want them. In Mississauga, maybe they should be allowed to build three-storey buildings on their main streets instead of just strip malls and the old, traditional parking lots. House people on main streets where there is public transit and they can get to work and school. So that’s one thing. It doesn’t cost any money to allow, as of right, on our main streets—no cost. In fact, you’ll get housing. It’s not a silver bullet, but it’s part of the new ideas we have to look at if we want to build housing.", "I know that there was a housing summit here in Toronto, and word came out: “We need $12 billion to fix the housing problem.” Well, it’s not just money. We also have to change the way we zone and plan, and our land use approaches. That’s why this bill is about land use. It’s about allowing that incentive of inclusionary zoning to give builders who are going to build—say, “Listen, 10% of your units have to be affordable.” Many builders would do that because they know they would get approvals. They could maybe get a little bit more density, a little bit more height. Many builders favour this inclusionary zoning. The builder who risks his or her capital would be in favour of this—also, people who are going to be living in the affordable housing. We just can’t continue to build condos that are very, very expensive and very difficult to finance, to say the least.", "As you know, this housing challenge is very acute right now, with what’s going on in Vancouver. The federal Minister of Finance had to intervene yesterday—a historical intervention. Bill Morneau said that the federal government, for the first time in many years, had to intervene because in Vancouver, even more than in Toronto, the prices have gone totally out of the affordability range. So he intervened and said that from now on, there are going to be some restrictions on foreign ownership. That means that if you are a foreign buyer, you will not be able to use the capital gain loophole, as it is right now. As you know, the traditional capital gain is an exemption for the Canadian resident who lives in their home. They don’t pay capital gain on their principal residence. But a lot of these foreign speculators have been going to places like Vancouver, they come to Toronto, and they essentially get a tax break on this capital gain exemption. That is going to be stopped by the fact that now you have to be a Canadian resident to apply for the capital gain exemption. I mention that in terms of the affordable housing piece because that’s what’s driving up land prices; that’s what’s driving up house prices.", "So we’re not just talking about social housing; we’re not just talking about affordable housing or our hostel system, which we all need. We’re also talking about our children and our grandchildren, who are going to find it impossible to buy a house.", "The average detached home in Toronto—an average detached little bungalow on a 20-foot or 30-foot lot—is about $1.1 million. I don’t know if anybody in Chatham-Kent would believe that. It’s $1 million for a detached little bungalow that’s not even fixed up.

Hamilton real estate prices are starting to go up. People are finding that it’s much more affordable to live in Hamilton. You can still come to Toronto, if you work in Toronto, in the GTA, on the GO train. Hamilton is really becoming a hot place to live because it’s affordable. It’s a great city. You’re near the water. You’ve got the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. So why not move to Hamilton? It’s a lot more affordable than Barrie. So people are now moving to places like Hamilton, and that’s a very good thing.", "In Toronto, meanwhile, we’re stuck with the speculation that takes place in real estate, and when real estate speculation takes place, it not only hurts potential homebuyers, but it hurts people who are looking for affordable housing, because land prices keep going up, so people who want to buy tracts of land to build affordable housing can’t afford to buy them. I know we’ve had some of our churches build affordable housing, and some of our non-profit partners, but with land going up and up and up, it really makes it difficult. So this land speculation has to be tempered.", "I know in Vancouver, in the month of September, house sales went down 33%. That’s because the BC government intervened and imposed a 15% tax on foreign buyers of homes in the city of Vancouver—a 33% drop in sales of homes. Now, whether that is a tool that should be used is up for a lot of debate and discussion, but that’s how severe it’s getting, that the province of British Columbia had to intervene because of this incredible escalation of prices in the Vancouver area. They’re even higher than Toronto.", "That is why the federal Minister of Finance has intervened. He’s also putting more restrictions on mortgages, that now there are going to have to be more stress tests on mortgages, which there weren’t before. As you know, Mr. Speaker—I don’t know if you’ve heard—there are people carrying mortgages of $500,000, $800,000. These are young couples who are buying homes that are little bungalows with an $800,000 mortgage on them. So, rightfully so, we have to warn people and say, “Listen, are you really ready to take on that load?”", "I know the mortgage rates are low now, historically, but I don’t know if you can remember—I know the member from Glengarry–Prescott–Russell remembers—that back in the 1980s and 1990s, we had mortgage rates that at one time went up to 18%. People lost their homes. They’re not always going to be at 2%, 3% or 4%, but how do you tell a young person, “Well, be careful. Mortgage rates could go up”? They won’t believe you, because they’ve been low for a number of years.", "This is the incredible challenge we have here in Ontario. There’s no magic bullet here. This bill, I think, deals with a critical part of affordable housing, but it is part of a longer series of initiatives we have to take as the provincial government, and municipal governments have ;to take these initiatives too.", "Somebody mentioned secondary suites, and that was a very important part of legislation that the Liberal government passed a number of years ago, which allowed for nanny suites and secondary suites to be included. So if you’ve got a big house and you’ve got a basement that you get up to standards, that would be legal to live in. Before, it was very difficult. Basement apartments and nanny suites were always considered illegal, but now they’re allowed as a result of the provincial change we made a number of years ago.", "The problem with the allowing of secondary suites is that many municipalities have made it almost impossible for people to put in secondary suites. Do you know what they’ve done? They’ve increased the number of hoops you’ve got to go through to make that secondary suite legal. So a person who has a big home and says, “Well, I’m retired now. I’m going to rent part of my home,” then says, “Well, why should I spend all this money fixing up that secondary suite when city hall will never give me the approval?” Some municipalities don’t like that secondary suite inclusion.", "I know that in Toronto they’re very proactive on that, because tens of thousands of people have found new homes in those secondary suites, but in other municipalities across Ontario they have the ability to do that but haven’t done it. So there’s potential for a lot more housing there—to have fewer restrictions and less red tape, to allow people to have secondary suites in their homes so that they can make a bit of income, especially if they’re on fixed income, and then provide housing for a student or a single person. They could easily live in that big home, in a secondary suite.", "But again, many municipalities are not co-operating with that initiative. That’s why, with this initiative here on inclusionary housing, I hope that it will be taken up by many municipalities. I think it will be in the municipalities where there’s a very, very vibrant, active housing market. It doesn’t mean that all municipalities are going to look to it, but I think it is a good option, and I like the fact that it is an option, because one size does not fit all. It’s much different in terms of the housing market and the affordability market whether it be Toronto or Apsley. If you’re going to rent a place in Apsley, you could probably get it for about 500 bucks a month. You can get a nice place in Apsley, but Apsley is not Toronto." ],

But remember, it’s not just money alone that’s going to fix the affordable housing challenge. It takes changes in our zoning and our attitudes. It also takes the fact that there are many acres of land available in all our cities that could be made into housing. The problem is that assembling this land and making it available for housing is most expensive and difficult, so we have to make that easier to allow marginal land—even in Toronto, there’s all kinds of land available that could be used for housing, but because of the expense and the process and the time, sometimes that is years and years in the waiting.", "The good news is that in my own riding I have an amazing housing renewal project.

He knew it all, he’d seen it all and he led the way for political reporting in this province for many years.", "Adam, again, was another political reporter, and he and I were elected to our city councils at the same time, he in Toronto and me in Windsor. We were both political reporters and went into municipal politics. I always thought he was a New Democrat, and then, out of the blue—I’m surprised—he runs for the Liberals. He gets a better deal, and he’s the parliamentary minister to the Prime Minister right now." ],

It has a very difficult rental market, and I think that’s maybe not unusual for university towns where a lot of students move in every fall and there’s tremendous competition. So the rents are quite high for not-very-good-quality rental housing. The whole issue around providing more affordable—not just more, but also affordable—rental housing is huge, and I think this bill that’s before us will help that.", "One of the things with the whole issue of inclusionary zoning—that can work in a number of ways, but the principle behind it is that we want to have a variety of housing in one community or one project. There’s a project going through approvals in Guelph right now actually, in downtown Guelph at the old tennis courts across from the Church of Our Lady—now the Basilica of Our Lady. It’s actually a project that Guelph will be presenting as the current tranche of affordable federal-provincial housing.", "But what’s cool about it is that it demonstrates why inclusionary housing works, because it’s a private developer that’s proposing it, Tom Lammer. What he is proposing is to do a mix of market-rent and affordable-housing units, and the fact that you may get an extra storey, as my colleague mentioned, would enable him to go to up an extra storey, have market units but still include affordable units. I think this is something we need to do more of." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to give comment today to the member from Eglinton on Bill 7, the Promoting Affordable Housing Act, 2016. We’ve heard a lot of comments in the Legislature of the need for affordable housing. I hear it constantly in my riding of Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock. My wait-lists for affordable housing are in the thousands, and it’s many, many years—I’m talking at least over six years—to wait. Unfortunately, I have more and more people adding onto the list, waiting for affordable housing because the number one issue in my riding is the cost of hydro.", "I’ve said this many times in the Legislature, and it is absolutely true: It’s the tipping point for people, especially those who are on fixed incomes, the marginal people who were just making the bills as it was over the few last years. It’s actually heartbreaking, the stories I hear in my riding where they are cooking their food outside so as to not turn the stove on. They have load limiters on, like we’re in some other country, because they can’t afford the hydro. Hydro has actually come and put a load limiter to limit the amount of hydro they can use. I have people that are hitchhiking because they can’t afford a car now to get to the job to pay the hydro bill.", "My food banks are at their max. They worked hard. I can’t praise my food banks enough for the coordination among themselves to try and meet the ever-increasing need, the need for extra money. Look at the United Ways: 30% of their budget is helping people pay their hydro bill. Affordable housing, for sure, is needed, but the cost of affordable housing is going to be so much because they are going to have a hydro bill even if they get into some type of affordable housing. That has been something that is actually in crisis proportion in my riding—the level of people in poverty who are desperate and need more housing." ],

I was disappointed that the Conservatives didn’t mention whether they’re in favour of or opposed to the inclusionary housing provisions. They talked about hydro but they didn’t talk about the housing issue.", "I just want to say to the member from Windsor–Tecumseh, I think we have to do more to promote these great communities all across Ontario. I don’t think we really do enough of a job to say, “Hey, listen. These are great places to live. Whether it’s Hamilton or whether it’s Harrow or Amherstburg, these are fantastic places.” I think if we can do more of that, we’ll get people to move businesses and jobs. We’ve got to do a better job of that. Everybody hears of Toronto and they all come here. But these are things we’ve got to do more of.", "I just want to say that the one thing I wanted to emphasize is that when we’re looking at affordable housing, I think we’ve got to look at the macro picture, and that is that when we’re talking about affordable housing, we’re talking about keeping land affordable, keeping building lots affordable and encouraging development through these inclusionary housing provisions. We’ve got to look at building social housing. So it’s not just building one type of housing; we’ve got to think of ordinary people who may want to live in a small condo or a small bungalow. We’ve got to think of the whole spectrum of housing because it’s all interrelated and you can’t just say, “We have people waiting for assisted housing.” No. We’ve got to look at what’s happening to our land prices and our housing prices. Our children and grandchildren: Where are they going to live? Can they get a job where they live? So we’ve got to work together with the federal government and the municipal government. I think this approach is part of that collaborative approach which says, “We want to work with municipalities to provide more affordable housing when we build housing.”" ],

I was actually the deputy critic to the now critic for municipal affairs, Ernie Hardeman. I was a young woman. I had just turned 31. I was told by John Tory, our leader at the time and now mayor of Toronto, that I would be apprenticed to Ernie. So, of course, because Ernie has such great hair, I actually nicknamed him at the time “The Donald.” He never fired me, and he has assured me he will not be running to make America great again, but it’s wonderful to be able to be part of this again. Of course, he now sits beside me, and he’s the Chair of public accounts and I’m the Vice-Chair, so it’s a fun little thing. We’ve become really good friends over that past decade.", "He has put a great deal of thought into our response as Progressive Conservatives to this piece of legislation. I wanted to point out that one of the previous PC speakers, I think our colleague from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock, spoke about affordability in perhaps general terms but in real terms that affect the people of Ontario regardless if they live in big cities like Toronto or my city of Ottawa, or anywhere, frankly, across this great province.", "She talked about something that’s near and dear to my heart. This Thursday, I will be attending an event for the Barrhaven Food Cupboard. Speaker, you know that over the past decade I’ve talked about the Barrhaven Food Cupboard many, many times. I’ve raised tens of thousands of pounds of food and thousands of dollars for them, because I’ve noticed, as I represent one of the highest-growth areas in all of Ontario, that the need today in the province of Ontario for our food banks has grown. My colleague pointed that out.", "I’ll tell you why, Speaker: because of the increased taxes that we have seen, and I’ll talk about that momentarily. It’s the result of the increase in high hydro bills right across the province. By the way, on November 1, this government will yet again raise the price of hydro in the province through a rate increase, even though they promised that there would be an 8% rebate on the provincial portion of the HST." ],

I worked for an Ottawa city councillor. Her name is Jan Harder. She is currently the chair of planning in the city of Ottawa, and it’s appropriate, because she represents the fastest-growing ward inside the city of Ottawa, which is in Nepean–Carleton.

This is where I have a concern: The way that the government is going about this, you might end up seeing a system where affordable housing is paid for by a small group of new homebuyers and not by society as a whole. If society thinks that we need to have appropriate housing for those that need it, then it should be, in my opinion, funded by all taxpayers. We can look at a variety of different models. We discussed some in the city of Ottawa; we’ve discussed others here in the city of Toronto. But I think that there needs to be an idea here where we don’t ghettoize people. That is a concern that I have.", "I live in a great community. Speaker, I want to tell you something—I’m going to give you a little microcosm. The city of Nepean—it’s now the city of Ottawa. My little girl goes to a school that’s over 50 years old. It’s one of the oldest schools in Nepean, and it’s now an urban school. She is just incredible. The daughter of the deputy head of the paramedics of Ottawa goes to our school; we have an Olympian whose little sister goes to our school; I’m the MPP; 60 Syrian refugees are in this school. There are kids from every walk of life, every corner of the earth, from every income level. Those kids are amazing, and they’re not ghettoized. The kids know that they’re all equal. Now, some days I might get a call home because I’ve had a little 11-year-old who may have been misbehaving, but you know what? She does take after her mother. I shouldn’t be telling tales out of school, but I got one of those calls about two hours ago. But that’s okay. She’s not watching right now, so she doesn’t know I just did this to her.", "I have this concern because I believe that if we want to talk about education—and I’ve just talked a lot about it—that’s the great equalizer. I think we’ve moved past this notion in society where people of one income level live in one area and people of another income level live in another area. In fact, we want to integrate people to be inclusive.", "At the same time, I don’t know how the government’s current model will be well implemented, and I worry. Again, we provisionally are supporting this, but I worry, when you’re looking at a time where, over the past 25 years, tax bills on new homes have increased from 3% to about 25%, about how that will work the way the government is promoting this. When you look in Toronto, for example, much of the shortage has been driven by environmental policy. At the same time, government policy around here has been restricting housing supply. It has also implemented dramatic tax increases at this level.", "You look at the PST, you look at the land transfer tax and you look at the fact that we’re trying to generate social change here. I think that we have to have a full discussion on how to best approach this.", "I want to go back to my city. In Ottawa, the average price of a new, starter single-family dwelling is about $450,000. That’s pretty high. That’s probably not in one of the higher growth areas. This is a startling statistic that I got from the Greater Ottawa Home Builders: $110,000 of that is tax in one form or another.", "So if we want to talk about affordable housing, we’re going to have to look at some of the systemic challenges that people face across Ontario. There was a story in today’s paper, and it might be published for tomorrow but it’s in the Sun today, where it said, “Heat or Eat?” This was a phenomenon that happened in Nova Scotia about a decade ago when hydro prices got too high there, and now we’re starting to see it in what should be Canada’s most prosperous province but it isn’t.", "We see the HST. We see debt retirement charges. We see the new cap-and-trade. We see the health tax. This is making life more unaffordable for everyday families who are trying to make ends meet, or people who are trying to stay in their homes. That’s a concern, and that’s what’s driving them to the food bank, like my colleague from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock is saying. When you look at the amount of taxes, and now we’re contemplating new municipal taxes, it’s going to be much more difficult—and then you look at the development charges that are on top of that as well, and transportation taxes for LRTs and subways.", "All I’m suggesting is that we have to look at all of that as part of the package too, and have a serious discussion. In late December 2015, the province of Ontario approved another new tax that every municipality could adopt on top of their existing development charges, so once again, you’re going to see that going up. That could cost new homeowners about $5,000 per home, and it’s going to be paid mostly by new homeowners in high-growth areas like—and I’m going to go back to my community—Barrhaven, Riverside South, Findlay Creek and a new, emerging community called Greely.", "Speaker, I know my time is up, but I want to say that this is an incredibly important debate, one I’m glad that we’re taking very seriously.

Basically, they made agreements with the hunters and anglers of the province: “We’re going to charge you a licence fee, but we’re going to take the money from royalties that we get from the commercial fishing industry, we’re going to take the money from the fines we levy on people who are breaking the rules and regulations when out hunting and angling, and put it in a pot, and that money solely must be spent to improve the opportunities for hunting and fishing in this province.”" ],

We wanted to understand what’s going on with it so that we could make changes. We could ask the landowners to make changes, and the hunters, in order to strengthen the population of the deer. Their response was, “We don’t have the money. There’s no money. There is not $10,000 out of $75 million that’s collected.” So that raised the issue where did the money go? They have not had a single answer from this government of where the money goes and how it’s spent.", "In fact, what brought today’s question up was the fact that the district stakeholders had a freedom-of-information act, and they asked, “Can you give us details on how the money is spent?” The response from the government was, “We don’t keep those records.” However, the Financial Administration Act states that in order to disburse the money from a special purpose account, you have to provide receipts and record it. So the government is not doing their job. What are they doing with the money? It upsets the hunting and fishing population.", "Mr. Speaker, the regulation books the government produces each year have declined.

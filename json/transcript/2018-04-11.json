  "text" : [ "As I was just about to say, the Liberal government has had 15 years to do something about the gender pay gap in Ontario. This certainly has been a problem for longer than any of us can remember, and despite knowing about the disparity, it has continued to happen.", "Today, it leaves us with a pay gap of 30%. Women are paid 30% less than men. In terms of lifetime earnings, what that means is that if a man retires at the age of 65, a woman will have to continue to work until the age of 79 to make up the difference in earnings. And the gap continues to increase for racialized women, who experience a gap of 32%.", "Recognizing that this ongoing problem is an issue, the pay equity coalition, an organization that was founded in 1976, called on the government a year ago to bring in transparency legislation. As they pointed out at that time, the gender wage gap had changed very little over the last 30 years, unchanged over that time because the enforcement wasn’t there and the funding wasn’t there to back it up. They correctly called for transparency, for legislation that would force employers to prove they pay men and women equally. As Fay Faraday, the co-chair of the coalition, said at the time, “It imposes an obligation to actually expose what you’re doing.”", "They even sent draft legislation to the Minister of Labour back a year ago, but as with so many other things, the government did nothing. They did nothing over the past 15 years, and they figured, just a few short weeks before the election, that it was necessary to get it done.", "We had a bit of a false start way back in March when this bill was first introduced, but we didn’t get the opportunity to debate it then. Instead, the government chose to put forward silly motions to serve their own partisan political agenda, taking up valuable House time—time that could have been spent considering important legislation like this.", "Then, of course, they prorogued the House, wiping everything off the slate. This government bill, along with others and private members’ bills, simply died with the stroke of the Premier’s pen. Many, many pieces of legislation that people all across Ontario had a stake in died when Premier Kathleen Wynne prorogued this House. Legislation that we were hopeful would be passed or at the very least debated by this Legislature was sent back to square one. Everything has to start at the beginning again.", "So all that time has been wasted and now here we are being limited by time allocation here with this debate.", "Legislation that comes before this House deserves an opportunity to be thoroughly debated, and we have an important role to play and to make sure that we do not take it lightly. Our constituents send us here to Queen’s Park to speak on their behalf—that is what we’re here to do—but the never-ending time allocation motions that come before us stifle our debate time and time again. It’s truly a slap in the face to our democracy and to the people we represent.", "Proper debate is particularly important when legislation comes before us that is inadequate, and that is certainly the case with the Pay Transparency Act because I’m not sure that this really does anything to actually improve the situation for women in Ontario. We already have the Pay Equity Act here in Ontario, but this government has never been able to ensure that even they meet their pay equity responsibilities within the government.", "We have a Pay Equity Commission that saw their funding cut by the last Conservative government, funding that has never been restored in 15 years of this Liberal government. This is a commission whose job it was to make sure that everyone was in compliance with the Pay Equity Act, and we expect them to do more with less money, which is something that this government has continuously done regardless of what the sector was or what the piece of legislation was.", "Enforcement and a lack of funding was a problem and it continues to be a problem. Over the years, the government has put pay equity requirements on organizations that they fund. There can be no doubt that that’s a good thing in itself, but the problem is that they never increased the funding that allowed them to meet those requirements without making cuts elsewhere in their budget. I have met people who work with developmental disabilities, for example. To meet their pay equity requirements their employers had to lay people off, freeze pay and cut other benefits. Workers fell further and further behind, and our most vulnerable were left without the necessary services that they needed.", "The government had an opportunity, when they tabled this bill, to make a difference in the lives of many, but in so many ways, again, they have failed. What we have before us is nothing more than a desperate attempt to win votes before the June election, and it’s actually a step back for the women of Ontario.", "This bill, the new Pay Transparency Act, doesn’t even match the existing obligations of the Pay Equity Act. The Pay Equity Act, for example, as the federal legislation that was planned, applies to both private and public employers with 10 or more employees. This legislation, at first, will only apply to the Ontario public sector, with the private sector only coming along later—first, with those workplaces of more than 500 employees, and then those with 250 employees. We already have a requirement in Ontario law that all employers must provide equal pay; yet, for some reason, certain employers are exempt from this legislation. For the life of me, I don’t understand the reasoning behind this decision—that this doesn’t apply to every employer in the province.", "As members know, yesterday was Equal Pay Day. I had the pleasure of meeting with the Equal Pay Coalition. As I mentioned earlier, they have a long history of working to reduce the gender wage gap, going back to 1976. They have done a huge amount of work and research over the years on this issue, and they have a good idea about what works and what doesn’t work. They presented draft legislation to the Minister of Labour a year ago and had high hopes that it would be achieved, but, again, they were disappointed. Now they have suggestions about how it can be fixed.", "This, Speaker, highlights why we are opposed to time allocation. This legislation, like other legislation, can be improved, but it requires careful consideration and consultation. Thankfully, there are people like the Equal Pay Coalition who have been considering this type of legislation for some time, so they’re able to respond quickly. They are suggesting a number of amendments, and they have prioritized eight of them.", "The first is that the act be applied to all employers with 10 or more employees in the public and private sectors to match what already exists in the Human Rights Code, the Pay Equity Act and the new federal legislation that was announced in the federal government’s budget about six weeks ago.", "Transparency reporting obligations should be set out in the act and not in regulations. They should also reflect what already exists in the Employment Standards Act, the Pay Equity Act and the Human Rights Code.", "The act should include mandatory timelines for filing transparency reports. Again, this isn’t something that should be left to regulations.", "A purpose clause should be added to identify the core principle that can be used to interpret the provisions of the act.", "They suggest that the Pay Transparency Act be enforced through the Pay Equity Commission rather than the Ontario Labour Relations Board.", "They call for penalties to be identified in the act for non-compliance to ensure that annual pay transparency reports are filed.", "Recognizing the impact of systemic discrimination, the Equal Pay Coalition would also like to see a clear statement in the act that an employer cannot consider or rely on compensation history in any way that undermines an applicant’s right to receive pay that is free of discrimination.", "Finally, they call for a preamble that establishes the context of the act; that is, a preamble that clearly states that the act is a means to address widespread non-compliance with existing laws.", "These are proposals, along with others that we will hear, that deserve serious consideration so that this bill can have a real, positive impact on the gender pay gap in Ontario.", "Speaker, I speak to women regularly in my riding, I speak to women in my family, I speak to friends, and I speak to people in the community, women who struggle each and every day. Many of those women work as PSWs; they work as developmental service workers; they work in very heavily women sectors. They are the ones who struggle the most, and yet they’re the ones who are taking care of our most vulnerable.", "I know a women, very close to me, who has been a developmental service worker for over 20 years. She went to school, she paid for a good education, she came out, she started in the field and, of course, worked part-time for years, not being able to get a full-time position—because that’s the way the sector works—at a very low wage. After 20 years of being there, and being now a team leader in a home that takes care of our most vulnerable, Speaker, I was disgusted, I have to say, to learn that this woman makes $22 an hour. She is responsible for taking care of the people who live in the home that she works in. She is responsible for ensuring that the house is cleaned, that the laundry is done, that the meals are cooked, and then she has added responsibilities as a team leader to ensure that she is doing bookwork. She’s actually doing taxes for people who live in the home. She has a huge amount of responsibility, and she makes $22 an hour. That’s not even close to what she should be making. This is a field that we know is very heavily—the workforce is women, who are doing these types of jobs. To make $22 an hour to completely ensure that our most vulnerable people have a full, wholesome lifestyle is absolutely disgraceful.", "But this is what this government has done. For 15 years, they have just done nothing about it. And now, at the last second before the election, they are bringing out legislation to once again make a group happy, in hopes that they can desperately scramble in some of those votes.", "I think time’s up for the Liberals in this province. I think it’s time for them to hang up their hats and allow somebody else the opportunity to do the work that needs to be done, to have fresh eyes on different government sectors, and to be able to ensure that the people of this province have an opportunity for something better. They do not any longer have to choose between bad and worse. There is something better on the horizon, and New Democrats are looking forward to that opportunity come this June election.", "Thank you for the opportunity to have a few moments to speak about pay equity today." ],

It is part of what we call the women’s economic empowerment strategy.", "I just want to say that sometimes, when we talk about ensuring women get fair pay for their work, we forget about all the mothers, sisters and daughters that work in factories, that work cleaning offices; many of them work in all kinds of manual labour. They, essentially, are sometimes the forgotten women, when we look at fair wages for women.", "I recall this mother who lives on Hopewell Avenue in my riding. Her husband, unfortunately, passed away when she was a young mother with two daughters, so she had to get a job working at a factory. She lived at Dufferin and Eglinton; the factory was at Finch and Dufferin. In order for her to have enough money for her two daughters—she was widowed—she would walk to work, up Dufferin to Finch, and work all day in a factory; being from Hamilton, you know how difficult factory work is, Mr. Speaker. Imagine working eight or nine hours in a factory with a half-hour for lunch, and then having to walk back home to save the TTC ticket. The TTC ticket, at that time, she told me, was about a buck each way.", "These are the working sisters, mothers and daughters that are still working in these jobs that are hidden. They don’t make the front page of the newspapers. They don’t make television programs. This is what this legislation tries to do. It tries to at least say that we have got to start to recognize that our mothers, our daughters, our sisters deserve a fair wage. Right now, they are not—because there’s been this historical gap between men and women. It’s not only in Ontario; this is worldwide. The same thing occurs worldwide.", "That’s what this is trying to do. This legislation is not going to solve all the problems, but at least it’s moving in that direction. Hopefully from this type of legislation, we’ll get the people that employ and own the businesses, that own the factories, to start to recognize that our mothers, our sisters, our daughters deserve respect for the work they do. Right now, not enough of them are getting respect for the work they do.", "Think of all the immigrant mothers, daughters and sisters who have done all the dirty work in Ontario for the last 50 or 60 years. They do the cleaning. They do the care work. I think of all the amazing Filipino immigrants we have who take care of our vulnerable elderly and our sick. They work day and night, and their wages certainly don’t match the guys in suits downtown. You ask them, “What do you do in that suit downtown?” “Oh, I make 500,000 bucks. I’m a CEO.” “But what do you do?” “Well, I’m a day trader.”", "Never mind the guys in the suits downtown, like us with the suits here; think about the working mothers, daughters and sisters in the factories, cleaning, cooking. Then, on top of it, as you know, Mr. Speaker, our mothers, sisters and daughters are expected to come home and take care of the kids. They’re expected to come home and cook.", "I remember my dear mother; she was a seamstress and tailor. We lived downtown. She would go and work as a seamstress and tailor on Spadina. That’s where they had all the sweatshops, on Spadina, where you worked in no air conditioning. You worked all day in these factories on Spadina. She would go to work, come home, cook, clean, do the laundry. You know, Mr. Speaker, I’m sure you went through the same thing. In the early days, when we moved into Toronto as an immigrant family—we came from Italy—we also had four boarders in the house. She would also cook for the four boarders. So on Spadina all day in the sweatshop—usually it was piecework. A lot of these young people here in the Legislature have no idea what piecework is. My mother would come home after working piecework and not only cook and clean for us, the kids—and there were four of us—she would also have to cook for the four boarders.", "In the house, a small semi-detached house on Bellwoods Avenue here in Toronto, with three storeys, up and down stairs, she would have to come home and also take care—we had the boarders. People say, “Wow, you had boarders. Why?” That’s the only way you could pay for the mortgage. And we had one bathroom in the house: four of us, mom and dad, and at one time we had my aunt and uncle on the second floor with their two kids. We had one boarder, and then a couple of boarders upstairs—one bathroom. A lot of the young people in this Legislature probably have not ever gone through that.", "That was the early immigrant experience, and you know who carried the load? Certainly the incredible immigrant men that came and worked construction—pick and shovel and all this stuff—they worked like dogs and ruined their backs. We know the history of the injured workers. But then there were the silent heroes behind the scenes: the mothers, daughters and sisters. They were getting paid peanuts in the sweatshops on Spadina, then had to come home and do double duty as cook and cleaner, and then they had to essentially always be compassionate and caring. I don’t know how they did it. But nobody talks about these unsung heroes. I’m sure in Sarnia it was the same thing: the working mothers and grandmothers.", "So this bill isn’t just about the white-collar jobs or this thing called gender pay equity. It’s about being fair and recognizing working mothers, sisters and daughters, and that we’ve got to move the yardsticks on this. That’s all we’re trying to do here.", "The sooner we do it, the better, because this is still going on today, the incredible burden on women—I see them on Vaughan and on Eglinton Avenue rushing at 6 or 7 in the morning. These young pages have probably never seen that. They’ve got the two kids on the streetcar at 7 o’clock in the morning—rushing, with two children under their arms, to go work in a factory all day. Then after they work in the factory, they go pick up the kids and rush home.", "What do they do when they come home? Do you think they’re going to sit down, watch TV and play with their computer or their iPhone? Who has got time for that? They’ve got to cook, clean, make sure the kids are fed and help the kids with the homework. Then you know what they get paid? They get peanuts on the job, and we say, “Well, why are these women complaining?”", "That’s what I want to put on the record. I know nobody likes to listen to this. I know you, Mr. Speaker, understand that Hamilton experience. I know we had a lot of good relatives in Hamilton who worked very hard." ],

This is a very serious bill pertaining to corrections and yet they are time allocating it and then, as a result of that as well, they’re only going to have one day of hearings. Take that up with the corrections officers. Take that up with probation and parole officers. Take that up with that entire ministry and the people in the field who are working and who are suffering because of the fact that this government is refusing to support them in terms of making their workplace safe as well.", "Having said that, I am pleased to rise in the House today to address what I believe to be a very serious problem. This Liberal government has a history of producing incomplete, skeletal and poorly thought-out legislation. This bill is no exception to that rule. The Correctional Services Transformation Act, 2018, is supposed to be a thorough overhaul of a broken correctional system, but it has the same deficiencies as most other Liberal legislation. The bill will not solve what has come to be called the crisis in corrections.", "Before I get into the meat of the bill, let me tell you a little bit about that crisis. Last year, a report by the independent advisor on corrections reform described shocking abuses and disorder in Ontario’s detention centres. Detention centres are overcrowded and cell block violence is a huge problem. In fact, it’s at an all-time high. After violent incidents, inmates are often held in solitary confinement without access to rehabilitation programs, and lockdowns are often the only recourse due to short-staffing. This has the potential to invite serious abuses, but even when solitary confinement or segregation isn’t used as a punishment, it still poses a huge problem.", "On the Liberals’ watch, prisoners like Adam Capay have been held in solitary confinement while awaiting trial. Capay was held for four years in conditions so degrading that previous inmates of the same cell had died. But the Liberals just didn’t seem to care. They ignored repeated coroner’s inquests warning of unsafe conditions. Fifty reports went up to the minister’s office and they were all ignored—50 reports. It would be convenient to say that the corrections minister was simply asleep at the switch but, in fact, the minister at the time had made a personal visit to Adam Capay’s cell. Sadly, not even that prompted him to act, and the Liberal government continued to ignore the problem.", "Now, in fairness, I’m not going to put all of this on the current Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services’ shoulders. Since I have been the critic of this particular file for almost four years, we’ve had numerous ministers, and they’ve been refusing to act in a proper way, which would show respect not only to the inmates, which this bill is a lot about, but also respect to the officers, the staff working in our detention centres.", "Back to Capay: It only became a problem for the Premier and her government when Adam Capay’s case finally reached the newspapers—so much for the myth of social justice government and the social justice Premier. That’s how the Premier said she wanted to be remembered. I don’t really think it’s working.", "Also released last year, a surveillance video from the Elgin–Middlesex Detention Centre in London shows just how bad violence in detention centres can be. In that video, an inmate can be seen beating his cellmate to death. A staffing shortage prevented the kind of intervention that might have stopped the altercation and probably saved a life. That’s part of the systemic problem.", "Sadly, assaults on correctional officers and other staff have more than doubled over the past seven years. That’s a very alarming increase, and my contacts within the world of corrections mention it whenever we speak. Much of the violence in Ontario’s detention centres is derived from smuggling weapons and drugs. Full-body scanners would do a lot to keep those things out of detention centres, but not all Ontario jails have scanners yet.", "A year ago, the Attorney General promised to install full-body scanners in all of Ontario’s prisons, but we’re still waiting. I might add, at that same time when that promise of full-body scanners was made, he wasn’t the Attorney General at the time; he was the Minister of Community and Social Services. What’s the holdup? Why does it seem to take so long? Why does the government treat the corrections file as an afterthought?", "But, Speaker, it gets worse. Ontario’s probation and parole system is a joke. Yes, that’s exactly what criminals have called it—not me; criminals are calling it a joke.", "Our probation and parole officers are not to blame. In many cases, they are actively discouraged from checking up on criminals by making house visits because of insufficient resources. Many are told that they’re not even allowed to work outside of business hours. But guidelines published by the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services explicitly state that community visits are a valuable method of verifying information and enhancing supervision, yet they’re not happening. Offenders are left to self-report. But, obviously, very few do.", "A 2014 report by the Ontario Auditor General drew attention to this problem, and a shocking Global News documentary on corrections published last year came to the same conclusions. In that documentary, the corrections minister was unable to answer any questions seriously, and she was unable to explain why violent criminals were not being properly monitored. I found this to be outrageous. It’s clearly a pattern from this low-information government.", "Here’s what stakeholders are saying. Under the Liberal regime over the past 15 years, probation and parole policy-makers have put enormous emphasis on probation and parole offender risk assessments, such as domestic violence, sex offences, enhanced offender-needs risk assessments and so forth. Strangely, this has basically transformed the role of the probation and parole officer from that of a public safety peace officer to that of a psychotherapist or mental health clinician.", "Nothing brought this to light better than Carolyn Jarvis’s Global News National investigative report entitled Probation and Parole: Who’s Watching? The current minister, as I said, was interviewed in that documentary. It didn’t go well. I wonder whether anyone in the government saw it.", "Anyway, Liberal probation and parole policies prohibit officers from conducting compliance checks and monitoring their offenders’ adherence to probation and conditional sentence orders in the community.", "My friend Scott McIntyre, vice-president of OPSEU and probation and parole MERC representative—as he puts it, “The Liberals have removed the ‘community’ from community corrections.” Scott has a way with words, so I’ll quote him again: “Excessive workloads and a lack of appropriate safety and security measures for probation and parole officers has handcuffed us to our desks.” Handcuffed us to our desks, Speaker: That’s a shocking image. But I’m afraid it’s what I would expect from a tired, out-of-touch, low-information government that doesn’t respect its stakeholders.", "The ministry says that the police are responsible for performing P&P compliance checks. However, Global’s investigative report clearly confirmed that the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police do not agree that it is their responsibility to do so.", "Honestly, who’s monitoring and who’s performing the compliance checks on the near 45,000 criminals who reside in our communities? When we realize that 60% of those criminals are medium to high risk, the crisis in corrections seems even more severe. That is an outrage: 60% of 45,000. If I do quick math in my head, that’s about 27,000 criminals in our communities who are deemed to be medium to high risk." ],

If this statistic were more widely known, people would be furious. It would appear that the Ontario Liberals have foolishly released criminals from custody in a probation and parole system that has a critical workload crisis and which does not perform offender monitoring in the form of compliance checks. The Liberals have utterly failed at ensuring the safety of Ontarians by way of having sufficient staffing numbers of PPOs—probation and parole officers—in a system that actively monitors offenders in our communities.", "One of the most basic duties of a government is to maintain an orderly and safe society, but if criminals on parole or probation are not being properly supervised, then the government has failed to perform a key part of that duty.", "Front-line stakeholders such as corrections officers represented by the Ontario Public Service Employees Union are justifiably outraged.

As a result, there is a constant threat to the safety of inmates and staff.", "“Further, our probation officers have such high workloads that they are unable to safely and effectively monitor offenders released into our communities.”", "That justifies the number I said earlier, when I stated that of the 45,000, 60%—or roughly 27,000—are not being properly monitored in our communities. To me, that says our communities are not safe.", "“These are just two issues that have created a crisis in corrections. The crisis poses a clear danger to staff safety, inmate safety, and public safety—and it must be addressed without further delay.” And so forth.", "Emails went out to MPPs, with copies to the Premier, the corrections services minister, the Attorney General and the crisis-in-corrections team. It was a great example of civic engagement. But the response was appalling.", "Let me quote Chris Jackel, who was chairman of the bargaining team for the correctional bargaining unit. I’m referencing another OPSEU media release. Here it is: “It’s very discouraging when government MPPs try to deny that our correctional system is in crisis.... It shows just how completely out of touch the government is with the reality in corrections.” That’s exactly what he said.", "Furthermore, OPSEU condemned the canned, low-information response from the government. Mr. Jackel called the prepared messages “highly politicized.” He said that it was “the kind of non-response politicians use at question period to avoid answering difficult questions. When you use them to respond to the genuine concerns of workers on the ground, they’re just a slap in the face.”", "“Just a slap in the face”: These are strong words. But I’m afraid I have to agree.", "By way of example, Mr. Jackel came down hard on the government’s assertion that “Ontario’s streets are safer than ever.” That was the government’s assertion. Mr. Jackel “described the claim as ‘preposterous.’ He pointed out that a Global News investigation revealed there are no compliance checks for 50,000 offenders in the community—including sex offenders. Further, Ontario has the country’s highest recidivism rates.”", "That brings us back to the origin of this bill that we’re now debating. The Liberal government, which is about to shuffle off this mortal coil, wants us to believe that they’ve had a deathbed conversion—or maybe we might call it a pre-election conversion. That might be more accurate.", "I suppose the Liberals didn’t want to go down in history as dumb on crime. They wanted one last shot at addressing stakeholders’ anger, and maybe even at correcting their own mistakes. So less than 100 days before the next election, they finally introduced a bill which purports to resolve the crisis that I just described. Well, I really want to emphasize that word “purports,” because this bill is really the triumph of hope over experience.", "I note that OPSEU was pleased about one major aspect of this bill, however, which is that the government seems to finally have decided that there really is a crisis in corrections. Otherwise, the bill leaves much to be desired.", "When it comes to criticizing the bill, the problem is not where to begin but where to stop. So let’s start now.", "Let me draw your attention to one of the strangest aspects of this bill. Would you believe me if I told you that the government is giving itself 10 years to bring this bill into effect? That’s right: 10 years. Yet we just heard at the very beginning that the minister talked about—and that would be the Minister of Agriculture, who introduced this for time allocation; he said that we will have a total of two hours for a sham of a plan that would take the government 10 years to implement. Ten years to implement, and they are time-allocating. They are only having one day of committee, allowing people to come and state their case with regard to this bill. But it’s going to take them 10 years to implement?", "They talk about referencing or discussing aspects with their stakeholders, and I question who their stakeholders really are and how much time they spent getting the facts from their stakeholders. You can see it for yourself in section 147(2).", "What kind of government needs 10 years to pass and implement a law? Ten years? Did the Chrétien-Martin government pass legislation only to have it finally implemented under Stephen Harper a decade later? I don’t think so. Did the McGuinty government spend its early years passing and implementing legislation from the Mike Harris and Ernie Eves government? I don’t think so. Is Prime Minister Gerald Butts—I mean, Justin Trudeau—busy passing Stephen Harper’s bills? No, that would be laughable.", "So there are many things a reasonable person might conclude about this strange timeline. One is that the Liberals think that they deserve to be in power forever. They think they will be in power forever, or at least 10 years from now, so the ridiculous 10-year timetable will suit that fantasy just fine.", "Another, more likely, possibility is that the Liberals don’t know how to solve the crisis in corrections and don’t expect to be able to do so ever. Well, Mr. Speaker, my instincts tell me that the second one is true, not the first. This absurdly long timeline is a good enough reason on its own to reject the bill altogether.", "There are, of course, other good reasons. Let us remind ourselves again of the context of the crisis in corrections. The bill comes in response to a series of damning reports and investigations by the Ontario Human Rights Commission, the Ontario Ombudsman, the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre Task Force and the independent adviser on corrections. Sadly, some of their findings highlight problems that were already old but haven’t yet been addressed.", "My friend Monte Vieselmeyer, who is chairman of the ministry employee relations committee for correctional services at OPSEU, had this to say in a press release earlier: “The ministry has failed to give front-line staff the tools they need to properly manage segregation. I refer to these tools as the three Ts: training, technology, and time.” He goes on to say, “Of course, none of these things come without a price tag. They require substantial funding and staffing investments by the ministry. If they’re serious about easing the crisis around segregation, they have to address the larger crisis in corrections.”", "OPSEU president Smokey Thomas had some strong comments also. In response to the Ombudsman’s report on segregation, he had the following to say: “None of this is new—it’s all about a properly funded corrections system and properly funded public services. There’s just no getting around it, and nothing is going to change until this government finally takes responsibility for easing the crisis that its austerity agenda has created.”", "We’re talking about a serious breakdown in an important part of our justice system and a failure to enforce law and order. We’re talking about problems which extend to every part of the corrections system. Minor tinkering is not going to help.", "Let me repeat so that I’m not misunderstood: Detention centres are crowded. Cellblock violence is a huge problem. After violent incidents, inmates are often held in solitary confinement without access to rehabilitation programs.", "A newly released surveillance video from the Elgin-Middlesex Detention Centre in London shows how bad the violence can be. In that video, an inmate can be seen beating his cellmate to death. I talked about that earlier. A staffing shortage prevented the kind of intervention that might have stopped that altercation and, as I said earlier, may have saved that individual’s life.", "Assaults on correctional officers and other staff have more than doubled over the past seven years. Too many inmates are now held in solitary confinement, often in appalling conditions, and sometimes for years. The Ontario Human Rights Commission has taken the government to court over such terrible costs and abuses.", "Why am I reminding you of this, Mr. Speaker? Well, let me tell you. People often say that Canada’s founding motto is “peace, order and good government.” That’s from the British North America Act, the BNA Act, as we all call it. Apart from that, the maintenance of order is an important conservative principle.", "Edmund Burke, the father of English-speaking conservatism, put it best: “The only liberty that is valuable is a liberty connected with order; that not only exists along with order and virtue, but which cannot exist at all without them. It inheres in good and steady government, as in its substance and vital principle.”", "But what about order? Let me answer that question by quoting American historian and political theorist Russell Kirk. He says, “‘Order’ is the principle and the process by which the peace and harmony of society are maintained. It is the arrangement of rights and duties in a state to ensure that people will have just leaders, loyal citizens, and public tranquility. It implies the obedience of a nation to the laws of God, and the obedience of individuals to just authority. Without order, justice can rarely be enforced, and freedom cannot be maintained.”", "In our political tradition, we do not separate order from justice and freedom. Again, Russell Kirk explains: “‘Justice’ is the principle and the process by which each man is accorded the things that are his own—the things that belong to his nature. This concept the old Greeks and Romans expressed in the phrase ‘to each his own.’ It is the principle and the process that protects a man’s life, his property, his proven rights, his station in life, his dignity. It also is the principle and the process that metes out punishment to the evildoer, which enforces penalties against violence and fraud. The allegorical figure of Justice always holds a sword. Justice is the cornerstone of the world—divine justice and human justice. It is the first necessity of any decent society.”", "Then Kirk goes on to say, “‘Freedom’ is the principle and the process by which a man is made master of his own life. It implies the right of all members of adult society to make their own choices in most matters. A slave is a person whose actions, in all important respects, are directed by others; a free man is a person who has the right—and the responsibility—of deciding how he is to live with himself and his neighbours.”", "Speaker, again I say that the most basic duty of government is to maintain an orderly society. That is the foundation of justice and freedom. But if the detention centres are inhumane, and dangerous criminals on parole or probation are not being properly supervised, a government has failed to maintain an orderly society.", "The current Liberal government and its supporters should ask themselves how they allowed this to happen. They should start by asking themselves why they allowed appalling violence in detention centres to get so out of control. How did they allow detention centres to become so badly crowded? Why are they over capacity? There are those in the ministry who will deny that statement and say, “Oh, no, no. That’s not the case.” You know what? I would prefer not to talk to the ministry on that and use their numbers. I would prefer to talk to the correctional officers and those in our detention centres, because that’s where you will find the real truth of what’s going on in those detention centres. But I’m not calling the ministry any of those bad words that they might when the truth doesn’t really come out. I’m just suggesting that we need to talk to those in our detention centres to find out exactly what’s going on. That’s where the rubber meets the road.", "Why has it not occurred to the minister that crowded jails could, at least in theory, be combatted by reducing excessive wait times for corrections investigations and by providing the resources necessary for staff in detention centres? Why is it not obvious that the proper supervision and enforcement of probation and parole officers is absolutely essential? Why does no one seem to realize that it’s high time the government did something about enforcing its own guidelines?", "This pre-election conversion just won’t cut it. It’s fooling no one. Both recent reports that I mentioned paint a very grim picture indeed. Minor tinkering isn’t going to fix the crisis in corrections. The government must take serious action and thorough action immediately, not 10 years from now, which the bill purports to do: “Well, we’ll have it all figured out in 10 years, when that magical year comes.”", "Well, I beg to differ. I don’t think this government is going to be in office for 10 years. As a matter of fact, I’m questioning how long they’re going to be in office considering the June 7 election date. That’s probably somewhere around 62 days. If that’s the case, they’ve got a lot of work to do.", "The bill before us is totally inadequate. What does the bill propose? Let’s get at that right now. First, the bill attempts to redefine what “segregation” means. Let me read from the bill:", "“Inmates held in conditions that constitute segregation or restrictive confinement retain all rights and privileges of inmates in general population housing except those that can only be enjoyed in association with other inmates.", "“Certain inmates cannot be held in conditions that constitute segregation, including inmates who are pregnant, chronically self-harming or suicidal or who have significant mental illnesses or developmental disabilities. Inmates shall not be held in conditions that constitute segregation for more than 15 consecutive days or for more than 60 aggregate days in a 365-day period. The aggregate day maximum can be exceeded if authorized by a decision of the independent review panel. These limits do not apply in prescribed correctional institutions.", "“Superintendents may hold inmates in non-disciplinary segregation in certain exceptional cases if all other options to manage the inmate have been exhausted. The superintendent shall maintain a record of the options that were exhausted before the inmate was held in those conditions. The superintendent shall also conduct a preliminary review of the case within 24 hours after they are placed in those conditions. Inmates being held in conditions that constitute segregation for non-disciplinary reasons must be offered the opportunity at regular intervals to associate with others.", "“Provisions for regular visits by health care professionals to inmates held in conditions that constitute segregation are provided. In particular, a member of the mental health care service team must review the inmate’s mental health at least once every five days.", "“A referral must be made to the independent regional chair to have a hearing before an independent review panel when an inmate has been held in conditions that constitute segregation for non-disciplinary reasons for either five or 10 consecutive days. A referral must also be made for any inmate held in conditions that constitute segregation when they reach 30 and 55 aggregate days of being held in those conditions.”", "Are you getting confused yet? Well, do you know what? When you think about all of this, who is going to really monitor that? I think about the administration, the bureaucracy that is layered and layered and layered behind all of this to ensure that this is really going to happen. So then my question is: Is this really going to happen?", "“Upon receiving a referral, the chair shall convene an independent review panel to review the inmate’s case and determine whether it is reasonable to continue holding the inmate in conditions that constitute segregation. The panel can also authorize a superintendent to continue to hold an inmate past the limit of 60 aggregate days in a 365-day period.”", "Well, that might be an independent review panel for one person, but let’s compound it: how many people in a detention centre times how many detention centres we have. This panel is going to be really, really busy. It’s going to get really, really thick with administration. I’m probably just simply saying this: red tape. Red tape is going to be huge.", "Let’s pause for a minute and break that down. The bill aims to redefine segregation as any type of custody where an inmate is highly restricted in movement and association with others for 22 hours or more a day. Certain inmates, such as those who are pregnant, mentally or physically ill, or suicidal, will be exempt from segregation. Segregation will be restricted to no more than 15 consecutive days and not more than 60 aggregate days in a year, subject to review by—here we go—the independent review panel, which will be created by this bill in future regulation.", "Here is the essence of the problem. My contacts from the world of corrections tell me that this is a bad move. Why? The threat of segregation as a deterrent or its use as a punishment will be significantly reduced if the penalty for misbehaving will be predictably restricted to not more than 15 consecutive days and not more than 60 aggregate days in a year in segregation. Obviously, the legislation foresees the possibility of extending prolonged segregation, but the precise details of this are vague—that’s right, vague. Typical of a lot of the legislation this government brings forth, it’s vague because it’s left up to future regulations.", "My friend Monte Vieselmeyer is chairman of the correctional division at OPSEU. Monte acknowledged that the bill addresses a number of correction-related issues—fair enough—including segregation. But after examining the bill, he said that correctional officers were still awaiting alternatives to segregation. This is what he had to say in a recent news release: “If the government wants to address segregation, they need to provide alternatives for the various reasons it’s currently used. One inmate to one cell would solve the problem. In light of Canadian case law, we need answers.”", "What the bill describes sounds not only inadequate, but also pretty bad. I’m referring to the plan to create the independent review panel. Leaving aside the fact that most of what it will do and how it will be staffed and so forth—I kind of touched upon that a few moments ago—are left up to some future, undemocratic regulatory process, this panel sounds like little more than a whole lot of paper-pushing and bureaucracy.", "The independent review panel will review and decide cases of segregation after five and 10 consecutive days, and after 30 and 55 aggregate days of segregation over the course of a year. Here’s the description of it from the preamble of the bill:", "“A referral must be made to the independent regional chair to have a hearing before an independent review panel when an inmate has been held in conditions that constitute segregation for non-disciplinary reasons for either five or 10 consecutive days. A referral must also be made for any inmate held in conditions that constitute segregation when they reach 30 and 55 aggregate days of being held in those conditions.", "“Upon receiving a referral, the chair shall convene an independent review panel to review the inmate’s case and determine whether it is reasonable to continue holding the inmate in conditions that constitute segregation. The panel can also authorize a superintendent to continue to hold an inmate past the limit of 60 aggregate days in a 365-day period.”", "I hope my colleagues across the aisle are paying attention here. I don’t even know if they’ve read their own legislation, but I digress.", "The bill foresees an excessively bureaucratic process of report-writing, consultation and deliberation on inmate segregation. The independent review panel would review and make decisions on cases at intervals of five, 10, 30 and 55 days of segregation over the course of a year—potentially 16 or more reports over the course of a year. That’s for one person. It should be immediately obvious why this is ridiculous.", "This panel is obviously meant to address the abuse connected with the segregation of Adam Capay, who spent 1,560 days in solitary confinement awaiting trial in conditions so appalling that previous inmates there had died. What’s the problem, you ask? Well, senior bureaucrats at the Ministry of Correctional Services had been alerted more than 50 times about Capay’s segregation, and the minister at the time had visited Capay’s cell and seen for himself the horrendous conditions there.", "If 50 reports and a personal visit from the minister didn’t motivate this government to do something about Adam Capay and the horrendous conditions in which he had been confined, how will more bureaucracy and even more reports help?", "In this connection, I’m reminded of the quote from John Maynard Keynes: “Government machinery has been described as a marvelous labour-saving device which enables 10 men to do the work of one”—which enables 10 men to do the work of one.", "There is also that famous—one of the greatest presidents of the United States, Ronald Reagan. Here’s what Ronald Reagan said: “No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we’ll ever see on this earth.”", "Obviously, the Liberals are inclined to think that more bureaucracy is a solution to every problem, but I beg to differ. At best, all that the independent review panel will do is chew up and drain valuable resources. At worst, it may create a culture of excessive report writing in order to justify the existence of the independent review panel itself.", "The fundamental problem is not the number or frequency of reports; it’s the fact that in the case of Adam Capay, all the reports were ignored. More paper-pushing isn’t going to solve the problem. Only a better, more attentive, more competent minister and staff will do that.", "The present minister’s attempt to dodge questions about the dysfunctional parole system and the rest of the crisis in corrections is an appalling abnegation of her ministerial responsibility. Ministerial responsibility means that a minister is ultimately responsible for all actions of a ministry, whether he or she knows about it or not.", "Ministerial responsibility is not a statute or a codified part of our Constitution. It is part of our unwritten traditions, but this does not make it any less important. If waste, corruption or any other misbehaviour is found to have occurred within a ministry, the minister is ultimately responsible, even without knowledge of misdeeds or oversights by subordinates. The minister approved the hiring and continued employment of those within the ministry.", "Normally, if improper conduct occurred in a ministry, an honourable minister would feel compelled to resign. Obviously this hasn’t happened, which is another indication that the government just doesn’t take its work particularly seriously. In fact, the minister’s attitude and behaviour have seriously eroded ministerial responsibility and decreased the public’s trust in government.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m sorry to say that this half-baked piece of non-legislation isn’t going to get the Liberals out of a mess that they have created and worsened. They think it’s icing on the cake, but in fact, that icing is sour, the cake is flat and there’s no substance at all. This will not fix the crisis in corrections.", "Problems with the rest of the bill are basically similar to what I’ve just described. Let me repeat: Forcing bureaucrats to write more and more reports isn’t going to do anything as long as ministers and their staff continue to ignore them. But hang on to your pants because there’s a whole lot more report-writing coming.", "Lockdowns are a typical way of dealing with out-of-control cellblock violence, especially in overcrowded detention centres, but this government seems determined to put a stop to that practice and introduce new and more onerous bureaucracy. According to the bill, if lockdowns last for five consecutive days, the superintendent must write a report and send it to the deputy minister and the inspector general. Superintendents must make and submit a new report for every subsequent day of the lockdown—wow. Lockdowns occur because staff are outnumbered and unable to control cellblock violence in overcrowded detention centres. That’s the root of the problem. Increased report-writing isn’t going to address the root cause and will only serve to burden the front-line workers further.", "An inspector general will be established by order in council. That person will have a broad mandate to review the report and direct the treatment of inmates and conditions in prisons. Again, the big problem here is that the legislation leaves all further details about the position to be defined—you guessed it, Mr. Speaker—not in legislation but in regulations. So we’re going to have to say there’s no input, no influence and no control over that regulatory process.", "But get this: The inspector general is going to have a lot of work to do, taking care of criminals and making sure they’re comfortable. Why, you ask? The bill requires every inmate to have access to every kind of health care service. Inmates in segregation must receive daily visits from at least one member of a health care service team. This is better health coverage and treatment than most Ontario families will ever get. It doesn’t seem fair, and a lot of people would be justifiably upset if they knew about it.", "But it gets worse. Absolutely, it gets worse, Mr. Speaker. It’s as though this government thinks that every problem—every problem—can be involved by more bureaucracy and report-writing. But just let me say that if bureaucracy immunized us from problems, nothing would ever have gone wrong in Ontario.", "But let’s get back to the bill. The bill provides for disciplinary hearing officers to be created by order in council. Their job will be to conduct hearings and to sanction serious misconduct by inmates. All further details are left to—here’s that word again, Speaker—regulations—regulations.", "Here’s the relevant passage from the bill: “An allegation of serious misconduct shall be referred to a disciplinary hearings officer. The officer conducts a hearing and may impose more significant disciplinary measures if he or she determines that the inmate has committed serious misconduct, including imposing conditions that constitute segregation for no more than 15 consecutive days. The inmate may seek to have a decision of the officer reviewed by another disciplinary hearings officer.”", "The silliest thing with this is that “serious misconduct” is nowhere defined in the bill. Once again, future regulations will determine what that means. Again, as I said earlier, Speaker, 10 years? They’re giving themselves 10 years to implement this? They’re not taking this seriously at all. The crisis in corrections is now; it’s not, “Come that magic last day of that 10th year, it will all be taken care of.”", "You know what? The silliest thing about this is that “serious misconduct,” as I mentioned earlier, is nowhere defined. I think there are two problems with that right away. First, as I keep saying, the regulatory process is entirely undemocratic, and this arbitrary government will be able to force whatever they want on the corrections community.", "Speaker, I could go on and on about this particular bill, but I want to make a couple of points here. First of all, this bill doesn’t do anything to really help and ensure the safety of our correctional officers or our probation and parole officers who are out there. They are dealing with hard-core criminals in many, many cases. They don’t have the resources—for example, full-body scanners—that would identify any weapons or drugs that are coming in. I’ve talked to several correctional officers who have had to pull someone down who was hanging. You talk about PTSD and how horrifying that is. I’ve talked to correctional officers who have had—forgive me, Speaker—urine and feces thrown in their faces. They’ve been bitten. They’ve been stabbed with little weapons. And then, of course, if they have someone coming towards them, they stop them, and they get written up for using excessive force. That’s not right.", "This bill is a sham. As a result, we will not be supporting this bill." ],

On behalf of the PC caucus, I would like to welcome the family members of Ron Van Horne.", "Ron served as a member of this Legislature from 1977 to 1987. Ron was a teacher, a school administrator and a superintendent. He represented London North and of course was part of the Liberal caucus. Prior to election, Ron served as the PUC commissioner in London.", "He was first elected in 1977, defeating the PC incumbent, Marvin Shore, by 4,500 votes. Proving quite how well respected Ron was in his community, he maintained that margin in future elections. As an opposition member when first elected, he held various roles, including critic of education and critic of northern affairs.", "In 1985, the Liberals took power. Ron became a cabinet minister under Premier Peterson, and he served as minister responsible for senior citizens’ affairs. Mr. Speaker, if I were to raise certain issues such as home care and support for seniors, expansion of the scope of practice of health professionals, a public inquiry into nursing homes, prohibiting of smoking in hospitals, development of coverage for dental under OHIP, and a tax exemption for caregivers who looked after their family members, you would think we were talking about issues of today, but those were issues that Ron faced as the first minister ever named to address the concerns of seniors in this province.", "Mr. Speaker, Ron didn’t hold back. He tackled those issues. By collaborating with stakeholders, he tabled a white paper, A New Agenda: Health and Social Services Strategies for Ontario’s Seniors. It was the first time in the history of Ontario that a broad strategic plan for seniors was developed. In my opinion, the strategy laid out the groundwork for an emphasis on home care and improving quality in long-term care that continues to this day.", "Ron obviously had a good handle on the issues affecting seniors, and he knew the consequences of not addressing those issues. I do have a quote from him here: “Seniors are a significant constituency in the province. Forty years down the road”—and this was back in 1985—“their numbers will create more demand for chronic care, the province’s health and social services system, and pension financing.” He went on to say: “Coupled with the relentless march of time, concerns of the elderly will be an increasingly important, high-profile area of government attention.” Mr. Speaker, Ron was ahead of his time and very correct in his position.", "After the 1987 election, London was well represented by government members. With the Premier himself from London Centre and the election of Joan Smith in London South, Ron did not return to cabinet, but he did continue to have the confidence of constituents in London North. Later in 1987, Ron was quoted as saying, “I’ve been here for 10 and a half years and I feel that I’ve served the constituency and the people of Ontario to the best of my ability. Now with this new government, I feel that my ambition, my heart or soul ... is on the wane and it’s time to move on.", "“I am going to my family.”", "And home he went, to his wife, Mary Jane, and his children Barb, Mary Beth, Ron Jr., Linda, Tim and Kris.", "Speaker, Ron had his priorities in the right order, and that is why he had a successful career as a parliamentarian. But he didn’t stop giving to his community. He served as chair of the board of directors of Sunningdale golf club, co-chaired the Scatcherd charity golf classic, taught English to new Canadians, was president of the ALS Society, was a Kiwanian, and assisted children with speech and language needs.", "Speaker, as you mentioned earlier, we’re fortunate to have Ron’s family here: Barb and Sharon, Beth and Jim, Ron and Scott, Linda, Tim and Cindy, Kris and Miros, and his grandchildren Andrew and Courtney, Ryan, Avery, Keeley, Jessica, Jackie and Kaity. I’m sure they’re proud of Ron.", "To his family here today: Time is the most precious resource. We want to thank you for sharing your time with Ron with us and our community. Ontario and Canada are better off because you allowed Ron to give his time to his community. Thank you." ],

It is an honour for me to deliver these remarks on behalf of the Ontario NDP caucus.", "Ron Van Horne’s family was very important to him and, indeed, his determination to spend more time with his family was a big factor in his decision to leave public life in December 1987, after more than a decade in office as MPP for London North. This makes it all the more meaningful to have so many members of his family joining us today.", "I’d like to once again welcome his six children and his many grandchildren. His daughters Barb, Linda, Beth and Kristin are here, along with sons-in-law Jim and Miros. His sons Ron and Tim are here with their partners, Scott and Cindy. And finally, of course, we welcome his grandchildren Ryan, Avery, Keeley, Jessica, Jackie, Kaity and Andrew with his partner, Courtney.", "His children noted that their father’s career was deeply rooted in his passion for public service, exemplified through his commitment to public education as a teacher and high school principal at George Ross secondary school, Sir Frederick Banting Secondary School and Clarke Road Secondary School in London, and later, through his service as superintendent of special education for the Catholic board.", "In 1970, he was elected to London’s public utilities commission, where he served until 1976, including three years as chair. It is not surprising, then, that in 1977, Ron Van Horne decided to make the jump to provincial politics, winning his first of four elections as the Liberal MPP for London North.", "In 1985, with the formation of a minority Liberal government, Mr. Van Horne was appointed to cabinet as the first-ever Minister without Portfolio for senior citizens’ affairs. His work in that portfolio became one of his proudest accomplishments, through his leadership of a comprehensive and sweeping review of all senior citizen services and the release of a major report on the health and social service needs of seniors in Ontario.", "In December 1987, with the announcement of his resignation as MPP, Mr. Van Horne received a standing ovation from all sides in the Legislature and a spontaneous flood of tributes. I’d like to share some of the words that were recorded in Hansard at the time.", "NDP leader Bob Rae said, “When I came here we were on the same side and I can say that he very quickly, as one does in the atmosphere of the House, made a point of coming over and chatting and talking about politics, quite apart from partisanship, and about family....", "“When the government changed and the member became a minister, I took the earliest opportunity to share some concerns I had had ... in terms of care for the elderly. I want to say to the member that I know we all felt he was working with great distinction to talk about and to raise issues within cabinet, within his caucus and within the House that are of great importance to the people of the province.”", "PC leader Andy Brandt said, “We deeply appreciate the collegiality, the friendship and the contribution he has made to this House, to the people of Ontario and also to the people of his riding.”", "In addition to his years in elected office, Mr. Van Horne found numerous other ways to give back to the community, serving on the King’s College board, the board for Brescia college and the board for St. Joseph’s Health Centre. He helped teach English to new Canadians, was president of the ALS Society and assisted children with speech and language needs, all of which is a testament to the quality of his character.", "Throughout his career, Ron Van Horne was dedicated to supporting his students, serving his constituents and advancing the public good, which he always did with passion and conviction. As a fellow Londoner, it is an honour for me to pay tribute to his legacy." ],

All six children are here, and many of his 19 grandchildren. I don’t think any of the great-grandchildren are here; he had four when he passed away and a fifth has arrived since then. It’s a beautiful, big family, and family was everything to Ron Van Horne.", "Many of his kids, in fact, played a big role in his campaigns. When you took on Ron Van Horne, you took on the entire family. He had a ready-made and formidable team. The family was a big part of his political success.", "Of course, you can’t think about Ron Van Horne without thinking about his beloved Mary Jane. They celebrated 60 years of marriage last year. Mary Jane passed away within weeks of Ron’s passing. It was truly a beautiful love story. They were partners in everything. She was a great support to Ron, but she never missed a thing. She knew exactly what was going on. She didn’t take—I’m going to edit this comment. She didn’t take malarkey from anyone. She was a very strong person, and as I say, you can’t talk about Ron without talking about Ron and Mary Jane.", "I had the opportunity, as I was preparing for these remarks, to speak to some friends, and one of the people I spoke to was a long-time constituency office staffer of Ron. I think nobody knows us better than our constituency office staff, so I spoke to Carole Echlin, who said that Ron was absolutely beloved by his staff. He was passionate, but he was also calm. As things in a campaign situation got more chaotic, Ron got calmer. He had a big, big heart. He was a very special man. Carol told me that she still runs into people, all these years later, who have something to say about how Ron helped them out, whether it was as a constituent or as a teacher.", "When people think about Ron, I think there are three words or phrases that come up over and over again. The first is “family.” Family was first for Ron. Carol said when he had decisions to make about what events to attend, if his kids had something on, they came first. I think we can all learn from that.", "The other value is “community service.” Ron was absolutely committed to community service. He learned that from his parents and he passed that on to his own kids—and I’m sure grandkids and great-grandkids—who really believe in giving back to the community.", "The other word that comes up when you talk about Ron is “compassion.” He really, really cared about people and had a particular compassion for students with special needs, which is really where he focused his attention as an educator. But he combined all three in everything he did: family, community service and compassion.", "We’ve heard about his teaching career. I looked online at the obituaries to see some comments that had come in, and there were several from students that he would have taught decades ago. I’m going to just take the liberty of reading one of the comments. A student said, “What I remember is how sympathetic he was to me, as a new student, and how he recognized my reading and speaking skills.... I don’t remember the books we studied or the essays/tests I wrote. But I do remember him fondly for his generosity, and for his sustenance.” That was the kind of teacher that Ron was.", "As we’ve heard, his public service extended far beyond being here as an MPP. He was on the PUC, and he was on the PUC when the pipeline from Lake Huron to London was built.", "In 1975, he was asked by Pierre Trudeau to run federally, but Mary Jane said she would kill him if he said yes, because they had six little kids at home.", "But by 1977, he was so mad at what was happening to his beloved education system that he decided to run provincially. He ran under interesting circumstances, because in 1975, the people of London North elected a Liberal to come to Queen’s Park. That particular Liberal decided he would be more comfortable as a Tory, and so he crossed the floor and ran as a Conservative candidate in 1977. That did not work out too well for him. He got trounced by Ron.", "Election after election, Ron just increased his share of the vote in a way that I think we can all envy. In his last campaign, he got 58% of the vote in what many of us would consider a three-way race.", "Now, on election night in 1977—as I’ve said, the person he beat had run as a Liberal in the previous election, so there was a certain special kind of emotion that night. I hope you don’t mind, Ron, that I’m going to tell this story. Election night, the results were in, Ron had won, and it came time for that awful concession event. The previous member had wanted to concede in the parking lot. Mary Jane’s response to that: “You tell that ‘bleep’-head to get the ‘bleep’ in here and concede like a man.” So that tells you something about how straightforward she was and how strong she was.", "There are many, many, many stories about Ron. He was truly beloved in London. I want to say a big thank you to his family; he couldn’t have done it without you. You all carry part of Ron in you, and we all are better for having had him here. When I think of Ron Van Horne and when we think of Ron Van Horne, let’s just think about family, let’s think about community service and let’s think about compassion." ],

Thank you to everyone who attended our reception earlier, and thank you for taking the opportunity to have meetings throughout the day.", "FASD is an umbrella term used to describe a range of cognitive and developmental disorders that are caused by exposure to alcohol in utero. When a woman becomes pregnant, alcohol consumption can pose a significant risk to the fetus and result in fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, and alcohol-related birth defects. While FASD has proven difficult to diagnose due to its complexity, early prevention is key.", "It is estimated that one out of every 100 people may have FASD, meaning that as many as 130,000 Ontarians may be affected. Recent studies suggest that this number may in fact be larger.", "Last December, my motion to establish September 9 as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Awareness Day passed unanimously, and I thank all members for their support. Shortly, I will be introducing my bill to help support students living with FASD in schools. This bill serves to complement the motion by encouraging boards to establish best practices and foster greater collaboration.", "There is more work to be done. Today is about learning from those with lived experience, parents, families, friends and organizations. It is but a single step in a movement that has been the result of literally hundreds of individuals and hundreds of hours coming together over decades. Let’s keep it going." ],

  "text" : [ "Time allocation on the correctional services transformation motion: I had the opportunity earlier this week to address some of the issues that we felt were very important in this piece of legislation, because they were a long time coming, quite honestly. Our lead on this was by the member from Essex, who spoke at length about the long-standing flaws that exist within the correctional system. Our critic so eloquently outlined the lack of accountability within the system and the lack of safety within that system with regard to the working conditions of correctional officers, which, of course, are then the living conditions of the inmates in that system—having also realized that 60% of those inmates have never had their day in court. They were on remand, so they are waiting for a court system, a justice system, which is backlogged extensively.", "Given that nature and that urgency of the court system, which is actually stopping people from accessing justice—on Monday I referenced the long-standing image that we associate with the justice system in Ontario, which is the lion and the lamb. The system is supposed to treat those two entities equally. The court system, the justice system in the province of Ontario, is meant to level the playing field, if you will, and give those in our society who have ended up in the court system—and, of course, the correctional system—a fighting chance to access justice.", "With all of that in the context of where our correctional services are and how we got here, which was very well outlined by the member for Essex, this debate is so important, because it has taken so long for it to come to the floor of this Legislature, despite years of efforts on the part of opposition members to get the attention of this government. There are only four legislative items on the docket right now here at Queen’s Park. It’s a bit embarrassing that the government is now time-allocating what is such an important debate on the way that inmates are treated within our correctional facilities, because that also encompasses the workers that are within those systems.", "As I mentioned on Monday, I think there has been a very clear delineation by this government that, for so long, because those people, those fellow human beings—some citizens; some not—are behind those walls, we can actually discount their value to society. There are innocent people in those institutions. I think we have to acknowledge that, because they haven’t had their day in court. Studies have actually shown that the majority of people who have not been able to afford their bail or their legal representation—and, to that end, full advocacy—are disproportionately members of our racialized communities.", "I can tell you first-hand, because I had the really eye-opening and somewhat shocking experience of touring the Vanier institute for women in Milton, as well as the Maplehurst facility, in Milton as well. If I could do it over again, I wouldn’t have done two institutions in one day, because it was a lot to process emotionally and to process as a legislator, because the problems are so embedded, so systemic. But what I saw in the women’s facility—I think I mentioned this on Monday—really was incredibly disturbing, in that the mentally ill are basically segregated.", "I will never forget one woman’s screams from solitary confinement. To the credit of the correctional officers who were with me that day, they said, “You know, it’s untenable.” They spoke to me honestly: “This woman—this is not the place for her. She needs the kind of care that you do not find in a correctional facility.” I think we all had this moment, because it was very traumatic and very dramatic, where we all acknowledged that this woman was in a situation where she was essentially being tortured.", "The member from Essex also mentioned in his hour-long lead that he gave earlier this week that we haven’t had a truly honest, straightforward conversation about the impact of segregation. When Adam Capay was found to be held in segregation for 1,565 days of his life—this was found out when he was 23 years old, so he went into segregation when he was 19—the conditions that he was in were really a point of shame, I think, for this province. It was mentioned in the piece—which was very well done by Brian Platt, at the time at the Ottawa Citizen—that there were people within the cabinet who were aware that Adam was in this state, with the lights on 24/7. The only relief from the light pollution he received was to have a canvas bag put over his head, Mr. Speaker.", "To say that his rights as a Canadian and as an Ontario citizen were trampled would be a gross understatement, I think. The only good thing that perhaps came of this discovery, which came to the floor in this Legislature, was that it shed a light on the levels of segregation as a coping strategy for overcrowding in our institutions and as a coping strategy for dealing with the mentally ill. Many of us have said—because you can’t say anything but—that segregation for longer than 15 days is a form of torture.", "This bill addresses segregation because this government had no choice but to address it, because you couldn’t hide from it any longer. You got found out. You had to do another study and another commission to find out the things that you already knew. Inherently that is what is the most frustrating thing about where we are right now in the province of Ontario: that on several files, be it transportation—where the economic value of two-way, all-day GO was established back in 2007, when I was first a candidate—or that Highway 7 extension, Mr. Speaker, remember? That’s the first time that I saw the ribbon cut and the shovel in the ground and the promises made. Then it just became like a strange warped version of Groundhog Day, because every couple of years there was that same announcement. And then you wonder why people have lost their faith in this Liberal government and question all politicians.", "We are all in this together in some respects, because the level of cynicism—this Liberal government has doubled down on that. They put it all on the table because we have a better-than-free budget. That’s what they should get. The t-shirts should be made up as soon as possible while they still have some money in the coffers.", "But I must tell you, that is the problem. The credibility problem, the trust problem, is a problem with our democracy when governments commission reports on issues like segregation and the state of our correctional facilities and then shelve them and ignore them. One of the more powerful moments for me in this House has been when I worked with the member from Nepean–Carleton and the member from Ottawa South and we actually forced the government to pay attention to that coroner’s report on Rowan’s Law and not let it sit on the shelf.", "That shouldn’t be the way it is. There should be a greater—I don’t know; maybe “trust” isn’t the right word—but there should be a greater weight to the information that comes into this place. If we actually listened to the research and listened to the evidence, then this province would have a restorative justice strategy where youth offenders actually have an opportunity to face their victims and learn from that experience and then enter into a system where they are supported either through mental health resources or addiction supports or housing supports. The state of housing in the province of Ontario is a complete and utter disaster because this government has left that over on the sidebar, left it up to the private sector, accepted no responsibility for the importance of having affordable shelter to the overall health care system and to the overall economy.", "When I think of this legislation and then I consider the impact of time allocation—if you truly want to have a piece of legislation be informed by the province and the people that you serve, then stifling debate on it and stifling us as MPPs is really—you are paying a great disrespect to the people that elected us. So it’s not personal for me. I care deeply about this issue, and I know that the members from London and Windsor-Essex care deeply about this as well. But it’s the people in our ridings that are actually saying, “Where are the solutions? Are the solutions contained in this bill? We should have the opportunity to share our concerns and identify the gaps that exist in this piece of legislation.” Once again, this has been the pattern, where this government brings forward a piece of legislation, is very selective about how they address some of the problems—even if you can get them to admit that there are problems, because they still sort of deny that there’s a crisis in hospitals, in the health care system. If you go through that exercise, why not fix it? Why not make the legislation actually work?", "One of the biggest lessons for me as a relatively new member of provincial Parliament is that going through this exercise in our democracy is frustrating for those of us who are on the opposition sides. I must tell you, I’m really hoping not to be in the opposition for that much longer. We only have 13 days of this sitting session, but who’s counting? I think that change is afoot, so I’m feeling hopeful and I’m feeling optimistic about that. But I’m going to take the lessons that I’ve learned as an opposition member whereby when you’re looking at legislation and crafting what should be a solution, which is adapting the laws that guide, in this instance, our correctional facilities, then you look at it holistically and you are truly inclusive in your consultation.", "That said, it’s taken them so long to get to this point that I feel it’s important to comment on the actual act but also the process, because the process matters in politics. It matters to the people who we serve. Given the fact that the legislative docket has very few items on it—I think the budget piece is coming forward and there’s the so-called Pay Transparency Act; that’s another piece of legislation that doesn’t do its job. So I have to question the motives and the intentions as the various ministers come forward. Why not, in these dying days of this government, bring a piece of legislation that’s actually going to be effective, that’s going to address the core issues of mental health in our correctional facilities, and the lack of health care that inmates have in our facilities?", "Some of those health care issues that I addressed on Monday are pretty shocking. I did reference, of course, PressProgress, because they put out a piece in November 2016; the title of it is, “There Is Something Seriously, Seriously Wrong With Ontario’s Prison System.” They start with Adam Capay’s story of being held in solitary confinement for over 1,500 days, and then they go through a timeline of how Ontario prisons got so messed up. This is actually an important part of the process, because in order to address a problem, you actually have to admit that there is a problem.", "I was quite vocal, when I last had the opportunity to speak to this legislation, in thanking the media, The Fifth Estate, for really creating a narrative of actually what happens there and, more importantly, I think, connecting the people who are in those institutions to us who are outside. I’m sure this wouldn’t come as a big surprise to you, Mr. Speaker, but there’s not a huge level of empathy for prisoners, even when people find out that 60% of those people haven’t had their day in court.", "Over the six years that I’ve been working with the people of Kitchener–Waterloo there have been four cases where I’ve had to do some advocacy for parents of youth in the system or for adult children in the system—securing that consent and trying to navigate a system that is not designed to be navigated at all. One young man, who had agreed to a longer sentence because that longer sentence would actually have him access addictions counselling, was denied the addictions counselling because the wait-list was too long. And yet he had already agreed to the two-year sentence.", "Here is someone who’s genuinely acknowledging that they have a problem which has led to their incarceration, who has pleaded to a certain level of years and agreed to a longer sentence, if you can imagine—because having been in Maplehurst and Vanier, I would do anything in my power to avoid being in any of those institutions, to work in them or end up in them, quite honestly. That’s the kind of world that would destroy me as an individual. I’m not built to be in prison, so this is why I follow the law as much as I can.", "So here you have this individual who has really found himself at the end of a broken system that had promised him hope to receive addictions counselling, which I fully support. I think that if you go to prison, you should come out a better, stronger person.", "The people who end up in these institutions, Mr. Speaker, do not come out, even if they’re innocent and they go into that system and they wait the two years for their court date—and there’s a whole cost to that. There’s the social determinants of health cost, there’s the societal cost, there’s the child welfare cost, there’s the health care system cost. The cost to keep people in prison and not give them their day in court far outweighs, I’m sure, whatever crime they committed—unless it’s extreme, which would not be in the Vanier institute.", "My point is that the system has gotten to a point where the system is the problem. The government had this opportunity to address the court system where the backlog exists.", "I have several constituents who have been waiting longer than two years for court representation. They’re anxious to have their day. Some of them acknowledge that they crossed the line, and they want to serve their time and then move on with their lives.", "There is nothing restorative about the system at all, and that runs counter to the bulk of the research of how you rehabilitate those who have broken the law or who have shown patterns of criminal deviance. It’s true that some can’t be rehabilitated. But the one woman I met when I was in the Vanier institute was the victim in a human trafficking instance. She got caught for carrying product, but she was the victim in that instance. So you have the re-victimization of victims, in that instance—predominantly women. There’s no lens in this piece of legislation which acknowledges that this can happen.", "Until you have that first-hand experience—and I think this is part of the problem. That’s why corrections went under the radar for almost a full 15 years under this Liberal government. We have 13 days left, and now we have this piece of legislation, and now this debate is being time-allocated. One has to wonder, what is the goal here? Is the goal really to build a stronger, more responsive, more restorative system that actually addresses the behaviours in society which lead to criminality? No. This piece of legislation does not.", "It is shocking: It was just this past January when the government made the acknowledgement that segregation could be considered to be torture. Other jurisdictions have come to the fore and have finally recognized this, but way before Ontario.", "The PressProgress article, which I referenced last time and many people actually—it’s not just my mom who watches this; apparently, some other folks do, as well. I did receive some feedback when I mentioned from this article that, “While the government doesn’t keep track of how many inmates are placed in segregation”—which is shocking—“the watchdog found 1,677 segregation admissions in just five months of 2015 at the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre and the Central East Correctional Centres alone. His office has also received 557 complaints about segregation in provincial jails in the past three years.", "“Noting that solitary confinement can have ‘profoundly negative impacts on inmate health and welfare,’ Dubé called on the government to abolish indefinite inmate segregation, with restrictions on segregation exceeding 15 days and an outright ban on keeping inmates in isolation longer than 60 days.” Even 15 days is quite cruel.", "Finally, the legislation does not address the health of prisoners. We really have this two-system state of affairs in Ontario. There are those people who can have access to health care and those people who do not. To look at the numbers, the rate of hepatitis C in our correctional institutions is 28% compared to 0.8%. The rate of HIV is 1.2%, which is seven to 10 times higher than in the Canadian population. Mental health issues are two to three times more common than in the general population. Individuals die of natural causes 15 years younger than people living in communities. The lack of basic human rights, being access to medical care, in our institutions is clearly an issue.", "When I met with OPSEU, they raised this as a genuine issue. I’ve had very good conversations with correctional officers who have asked for greater training. They recognize that the populations in our correctional facilities with addictions and with mental health issues are not the populations that they were dealing with even 10 years ago. They want to be part of the solution. I think, quite honestly, they’re just happy to see anybody talking about correctional issues, period.", "We still have some outstanding concerns about it. Obviously, we are going to support some of the parts of this legislation. We’re going to try to make it better. That said, though, why is this government time-allocating when there is so much room on the docket for the next four weeks? There’s not a lot of legislation to be debated, so why not try to have this debate be open, be honest and get all the issues out so that we can strengthen the legislation together? It really isn’t too much to ask, Mr. Speaker.", "I’m thankful for the time today. I’m thankful for the opportunity to bring forward these concerns from the people of Kitchener–Waterloo. Hopefully someone on that side is listening." ],

  "text" : [ "I want to commend my colleague the member from Kitchener–Waterloo for an excellent 24 minutes of her thoughts and information and experience around this issue. This isn’t her file, she isn’t charged with understanding all the complexities of it, yet she explained quite clearly and poignantly what exactly the issues are in a way that we on this side of the House hope that the government members understand.", "It’s interesting that there are 13 days. There are 13 days left in this session before we head into a general election. You wonder why it has taken this long to address just some of the issues that face our corrections and community safety and probation and parole system.", "I spoke to this issue on Tuesday. I had the hour lead for our party. Since Tuesday, we’ve only had one other member speak on this bill, Bill 6, and that was just now, the member from Kitchener–Waterloo. In truncating debate, in minimizing the voices of elected officials on such an important issue, this government, I think, is indicating that they’re not really ready or willing to hear any ideas around how we get to a better place in our corrections system. That’s incredibly unfortunate, because if there were ever a system that required our full attention and collaboration, it is this system.", "It’s referred to, Speaker, as the institution of last resort. I say that because what has led the majority of the people into our corrections facilities are failures on the outside: failures to intervene in mental health and addictions issues, failures to intervene in affordable housing, in proper access to education, in proper health care—the fundamentals of life. Sometimes those things that we take for granted here as elected officials, as we are all quite privileged—I don’t think anyone would argue with me. Some in our society don’t have as easy access to some of those things that we take for granted. It leads them onto paths in their lives that ultimately intersect with the criminal justice system, our legal system and our penal system. That’s unfortunate, and that’s what adds to the complexity of the issue and to the narrative of this story, where we are today: a crisis in corrections. It is not only a crisis in corrections; it’s a failure of this government to address those issues that have led us to this point.", "One in two inmates currently housed in our provincial facilities suffers from mental health or addiction issues. That’s an incredible figure that indicates a systemic issue that isn’t being addressed on the outside of those walls. That’s why I and those who work within the walls of our facilities refer to them as the institutions of last resort.", "This government some time ago took the initiative to deinstitutionalize mental health services in our communities around the province. That was a good move. That was something that I think civil society was calling for and the available data and science were also calling for: that we could do better in the community, in supportive programming for those who suffer from mental health and addiction issues. Yet there was never an investment in the resources in our communities that would actually lead to progressive and tangible benefits for those who require them.", "Where do they end up? They end up in our criminal justice system. The member from Kitchener–Waterloo made an excellent point: that it costs us exponentially more to house inmates in facilities than it would to be proactive and to ensure that they didn’t end up there in the first place. That, I think, is a given. I think anyone you canvass across this province would understand the rationale around that.", "We have not seen this government—and even up to today, with 13 days left in the session, there are no resources attached to Bill 6. Bill 6 essentially takes two pretty comprehensive issues that I would say are important: the framework around the use of segregation, which was born of the Sapers report that calls on the government to have regulations and parameters around the use of segregation that I think are in line with international policies and regulations, and that’s a good thing. We think that’s important. That was born out of, again, a failure of this government to monitor the use of segregation in our facilities, which led to the story that we all know: of Adam Capay, a gentleman who was in segregation for four years, and which definitely should have been intervened on prior to that.", "The other component of this bill that is another pillar is the initiation of an independent investigator. The inspector general is the position specifically outlined in the bill. The inspector general will do just that; they will inspect the use of segregation in our facilities and, among other things, the rules around the use-of-force continuum and general parameters around inmates’ and corrections officers’ interactions. This is an important component that I think will be welcome and will provide invaluable data and insight, and independent data, on exactly how we alleviate and remedy some of the issues.", "But it doesn’t and won’t get to the underlying issues of massive amounts of violence that continue to occur in our facilities. It won’t get to the issue of contraband continuing to be brought into our facilities. It won’t get to the issue of dilapidated facilities themselves. Our actual prisons are falling apart. Some of them have been built a century ago and we still rely on them to house inmates. That is not a proactive approach around corrections and community safety. That’s a government doing the bare minimum to maintain our public safety.", "I want to give a shout-out to those who are on the front line, our corrections officers and our probation and parole officers, because those who are closest to the problem are closest to the solution. If this government have any gumption to actually address the issues, they would be working in tandem with those people because they are dedicated to their job and they’re dedicated to their communities. In fact, Speaker, you know what? They’re actually dedicated to the people they serve: those inmates, those who are on probation and those who are working their way through the system. They don’t want to ever see them in those facilities again. They don’t want to see repeat offenders. They want to know the programs are there addressing their issues, helping them enter society rehabilitated—and with some tools to be able to be functional and also to contribute. That’s their charge. That’s what we ask them to do and they are committed to doing it.", "They are committed to doing it in the face of some of the most horrific interactions that you could ever imagine. Speaker, they see things that we, as elected officials, could never see. They see things that traumatize them, that make the job so much harder: drug addiction overdose, suicide, inmate violence and inmate-on-corrections-officer violence.", "Often, you hear stories of bodily fluids being used as weapons—weaponized. This is their reality each and every day. You can imagine: If that was the reality for elected officials, for members of provincial Parliament, how long would it take for you to remedy that problem? Well, it wouldn’t be too long. If you knew that on any given day you walk into the chamber there was a chance that you would get feces thrown at you, guess what? In short order, that would have been dealt with—not 14 or 15 years after the fact.", "And even not through this bill, I would say, because the bill isn’t resourced. The bill has no additional resources to add to the complements of corrections officers in our facilities. The budget has some numbers attached to that; I’ll give them that. I’ll give the government that they actually threw some numbers at the wall hoping that they would stick.", "But this is a government that has lost its credibility. Let’s be frank, Speaker: They’ve lost all credibility. Every line item in that budget comes with a gigantic grain of salt, and a huge caveat: “Elect us all and you’ll get everything you ever wanted and everything you ever wished.” The reality is that you had 15 years to address these issues and an eleventh-hour pardon isn’t going to cut it.", "Speaker, corrections officers have brought this issue to light for elected officials. They’ve rallied on the front steps of this building year after year. They’ve met and lobbied individual members. They’ve held consultations. They’ve studied the issue. They’ve added to the various reports and committees that this government has initiated. And yet, I don’t think that their input has been completely reflected, not only in Bill 6, but definitely not comprehensively in the recent budget that was tabled. If they took the time to actually listen to them, they would understand that the solutions aren’t so far-fetched.", "The solutions are pretty common sense: They need the resources on the ground. They need staffing complements that allow them to provide for the programming, that allow them to provide for the safe operation of the facility, that allow them to protect themselves and their colleagues. This is pretty fundamental in any workplace in Ontario, but yet when it comes to our corrections system, it seems as though it’s the bare-bones model of corrections.", "And that isn’t a far stretch from what you see in the United States, where a large majority of their prisons and their supermax prisons are now privatized, where not only are their corrections officers not unionized, but they are low-paid, part-time, temporary workers. We’re essentially getting there, Speaker. They’re just a couple of steps away: not adding resources or capital funding to facilities, allowing facilities to degrade to the point where they’re not even operational anymore.", "Even our newer facilities—I want to add this as a cautionary tale—that have been built under this government have been built under the P3 model, whereby you think you get the design, build and maintenance portion of a deal—that’s what they say is the cost-benefit or the value for money when you use a P3 model. Yet simple upgrades, like having door sweeps at the bottom of the cell, on the door, where an inmate wouldn’t be able to pass contraband under the door sweep, take thousands of dollars to get the private conglomerate or proponent to actually make because it’s not in the specs of the private deal, the P3 model that was brokered between this government and the proponent. That’s one cautionary tale.", "Often they come in over cost and over time, ultimately costing the taxpayer of Ontario. That’s money that I say could have been used more wisely and invested in facilities that are modern and that have the complement of front-line workers that actually makes them work.", "We know that our facilities require enhanced health care workers, nurses and doctors; dental staff have to be employed there too, and contracted. But yet, at the Windsor detention centre, the South West Detention Centre, they are understaffed. They’ve never been up to their full complement of nursing staff. It’s always a mix of part-time and, I would add, precarious nursing, professional nursing staff, who aren’t able to provide the services for those inmates, which then leads to downstream incidents that escalate and cause chaos in those facilities.", "That requires an investment on the part of this government. It requires them to actually be truthful with the status of corrections and identify and prioritize how to make those investments to bring it up to a level of just reasonable standards.", "I want to thank again the COs and probation and parole officers. Probation and parole officers, Speaker, I’ll just tell you, have the highest caseload number in all of Canada in Ontario. Our probation and parole officers carry the highest caseload per capita in all of Confederation. That’s certainly not a distinction this government should be proud of.", "Lastly, our corrections officers, for us to have garnered this information, have had to be incredibly open and transparent with the status of their working conditions, sometimes having to dig deep into those conditions, bringing about those stories of incidents that trigger some trauma or PTSD. We all know that they certainly have encountered it. I want to thank them for being so vulnerable. I want to thank them for being transparent and accessible and helping us understand exactly why this system is in crisis and how indeed we fix it, because certainly they deserve to work in a workplace where everyone is assured they go home at the end of their shift." ],

  "text" : [ "Thanks very much, Mr. Speaker. Just for context, for those viewing at home and just engaging in this debate, I had the opportunity yesterday for about 25 minutes to talk about Bill 31 and the budget. I started my remarks by sharing a story about my grandmother and how she got her Canadian citizenship, and I’m just going to share it again for context because it’s important to the broader point that I wanted to make with the speech.", "When my grandmother got her citizenship, she got it in the early 1950s. Back in those days, you got your citizenship down at the courthouse here on University Avenue. My grandmother told me when I was a kid that when she got her Canadian citizenship and the judge pounded his gavel and declared everybody in the room citizens, most of the people in the room started to cry. So I asked my grandmother, “Why did you cry?” She said, “I cried because I was relieved, but I was also proud.” Then she said to me, “But, you know, as proud as I was in that moment, I was prouder and prouder in the years that followed because, for me, Canada got better and better in the years that followed.”", "So when we put together a budget, this is not just about delivering on the needs of the people of Ontario today, but it’s about building the foundation for the future. Yesterday, during my initial 25 minutes, I spoke about how this budget lays a foundation that will help enable greater prosperity for the people of Ontario by strengthening education, by strengthening health care, by strengthening mental health supports, by providing free child care for families. All of these are examples of things that will help position young people for greater success. It will help support people of all ages when it comes to health care, it will help support our seniors through the free prescription drugs for those over 65, and I gave a number of other examples.", "What I want to do with my remaining time is just talk a little bit about some of the items in the legislation, highlight a few of the items in the legislation that, again, support that goal of laying a foundation to support Ontarians not just today but in the years to come.", "As I outlined yesterday, Speaker, our government has been implementing a long-term plan to grow our economy in a sustainable manner, and each step we have made, each investment we have made, has had a cumulative effect of not only helping Ontarians recover from the recession but also setting them up for a prosperous future.", "One of the key components to this legislation is the steps we have taken to protect consumers. Speaker, as you know and as many of my colleagues know, I have spent a lot of time as an MPP advocating and introducing legislation around consumer protection. This is an area that’s very close to my heart. Consumer protection is important because we know that an economy is made stronger when people can make confident, well-informed decisions in the marketplace.", "This bill will ensure that lawyer and paralegal contingency fees are fair, clearer for everyday people to understand and more transparent. These are the fees that form the basis of the “You Don’t Pay Unless We Win” slogans that you see on ads for legal service providers such as personal injury lawyers and paralegals. Ontarians have expressed concerns about the ease with which these arrangements can be manipulated to cost the clients more money. So our government is taking action to better protect consumers of legal services.", "One of the other areas that’s important to our future is retirement security. As you know, last fall we took steps to increase the guaranteed monthly payment from the Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund by 50%, to $1,500. With this legislation before us today, we are proposing to make this amendment retroactive to May 19, 2017. This will ensure that former Sears Canada employees can benefit from receiving this additional support.", "This bill also supports workers and retirees by proposing to amend the Pension Benefits Act to require disclosure to the Superintendent of Financial Services of events that may negatively impact corporate pension plans so that the superintendent can take more timely action to protect pension benefits. I’m proud that we’re helping to take care of those workers whose pensions were lost at Sears Canada.", "Another component to this legislation that’s important pertains to mental health and mental illness. Bill 31 supports our commitment to support people living with the burdens of mental illness by proposing to amend the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act to expand the presumptive entitlement to compensation for post-traumatic stress disorder made by workers in high-stress or high-conflict jobs: people such as nurses who directly provide patient care, provincial bailiffs, and probation and parole officers.", "Another component that I want to talk about is child protection. I’ve been talking, throughout my remarks today and yesterday, about laying the foundation for our future. To be able to do that, we need to make sure that we support and protect the health and well-being of our children and our young people. Schools should be safe spaces for learning, creativity and growth. This bill strengthens protection for children in educational settings by imposing tougher penalties for teachers and early childhood educators who are alleged to have committed acts of sexual abuse.", "Bill 31 proposes to increase the list of acts that result in mandatory revocation of a teacher or early childhood educator’s licence, and would require mandatory suspension for all other acts of sexual abuse. This bill would also require that the colleges governing teachers and early childhood educators provide funding for therapy and counselling for students and children who are the subject of alleged sexual abuse or an act of child pornography by a member of those colleges. This brings provisions for teachers and early childhood educators in line with rules and disciplinary actions that we have in place already for health professionals.", "Speaker, I come from the world of business. I used to be in management consulting before this. I used to teach at the business school at York University, in the MBA program. One of the things that I’m always thinking about is: What we are doing to support business? What are we doing to ultimately support our economy, create jobs and create greater prosperity for everyone?", "One of the groups of small businesses that have done a tremendous amount to grow our economy is small brewers. They’ve created a new microbrewery segment in our beer market. We are proposing to modernize and change the Small Beer Manufacturers’ Tax Credit to ensure that more breweries can expand their operations, create jobs and fuel economic development in local communities.", "This bill also proposes to support our province’s dynamic digital media creators, who contribute significantly to our province’s digital and economic vibrancy. The legislation would extend eligibility for the Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit to film and television websites purchased or licensed by a broadcaster and embedded in a broadcaster’s website.", "Speaker, at the foundation of our governments at all levels is a strong and vibrant democracy. It’s important that that democracy be strong at all levels, including the municipal level of government, so this bill will make it easier for the city of Toronto to change its council composition for the 2018 municipal election to better reflect the population changes in this ever-changing urban centre.", "We’ve reached an important milestone in our long-term plan. We have a balanced budget in 2017-18. I’ve been part of this. Members of our caucus, ministers and our civil servants have been part of some very hard work, over the past four years in particular, to achieve a balanced budget this year, and I’m proud of that. We’ve taken a number of important steps to make sure that we’re managing tax dollars responsibly and that we’re making strategic investments that enable people, businesses and communities to not only recover from the global recession but to come out stronger than before.", "We embrace change, and we help people get ahead today, while preparing them for the challenges of tomorrow. We struck an important balance and invested in people at a time when they needed it most. We helped families, but we also created opportunities and invested in top priorities like education, health and infrastructure. All the while, we helped the province transition to an economy that is more innovative and more resilient. And while we have navigated our way out of the recession, the global economy continues to evolve and we face a period of rapid change and uncertainty. I know that the people of Ontario feel that.", "We also have an aging population. More and more people are moving out of work and into retirement.", "Interest rates have risen from their extreme lows and there is the potential that they’ll be rising even more. Household debt is high and increasing.", "There is uncertainty with respect to international trade.", "There is rapid technological change.", "There’s a Buy America campaign and calls for protectionism.", "These new factors that I have talked about, and others, have caused us to be more cautious in our revenue expectations, but they’ve also reinforced the importance of safeguarding our fundamentals and letting our values guide our economic plan.", "As the Minister of Finance said yesterday, investing in the people of Ontario is an important and the right choice. By investing in their success, we are investing in the success of our economy as a whole, not just today, but in the years to come. By ensuring the people of Ontario can live more confidently, can shoulder the burdens of care in their lives, we are helping them to seize that opportunity and live that better quality of life.", "We have to adapt to the changes in the world economy. We have to become more resilient in the face of the economic uncertainty. We have to make sure that every Ontarian—whether they’re just beginning their journey through life, or studying for a future career, or bringing home a paycheque, or enjoying their retirement—can be more resilient as they forge a better tomorrow for themselves and for their loved ones. That is why, in this budget, we are focusing on care and we are focusing on opportunity. The two are obviously and inextricably linked.", "While I am pleased with Ontario’s economic performance, we know that more needs to be done to make sure that everyone is participating in that economic growth, because not everyone can right now. Not everyone is participating in that.", "When we look at the numbers, we know Ontario is doing well. It is one of the strongest economies in the G7. Our GDP is growing. Employment is at 20-year lows. These all demonstrate that our economy is performing well. But again, some people have struggled to recover. Some people are not participating in that growth. That’s really what this budget is trying to do, trying to lay the foundation so that everyone can participate in that success and that we maximize that economic success.", "In this budget, we are taking bold and tangible steps to help more and more people take part in the economy—an economy that has outpaced the rest of Canada and the G7 since 2014, that continues to innovate, that continues to attract investment and that continues to create jobs. We believe that is the job of government: to facilitate an environment where anyone and everyone has a chance to succeed, where hard work is rewarded, where values of inclusion, fairness and collaboration, and an enduring faith in and commitment to the talents and potential of the people of Ontario, will continue to be fundamentals on which we will build our economic plan for our province.", "As a result of staying true to our values and as a result of our dedication to fairness and opportunity, we are in a strong economic position. This budget reflects that. The fact that we are able to make the investments that we are making is a reflection of the fact that our economy is strong and Ontarians have delivered that economic growth; it is a reflection of the fact that we have managed our tax dollars wisely and by doing so allowed ourselves the opportunity to invest more and to deliver more services to the people of Ontario.", "I started my remarks yesterday and I started them today by talking about my family and my grandparents. I talked about how my grandmother talked about how she was proud to be Canadian when she became a Canadian but prouder and prouder in the years that followed because for her Canada got better and better in the years that followed.

I think it’s a piece of legislation that will make our province strong—not just today, but in the years to come.

They have everything for everyone.", "It kind of reminds me of a story, the story of a gentleman who had identical twins. The one son was the eternal pessimist; the other was the eternal optimist. He wanted to snap his son out of that pessimistic attitude that he had, so he went out and bought a bunch of Tonka toys and put the brand new Tonka toys in his bedroom. But for the eternal optimist, he went out and brought in a whole bunch of horse manure. The little boy went into his room—the pessimist—and said, “Oh, my, these toys are so beautiful, so nice. I’m afraid to take them out of the box, because they might get chipped, they might get broken. They’re just so beautiful, I don’t want to touch them.” All of a sudden, the father heard, from the other room, “Yippee!” He opened up the room of his eternally optimistic son and he said, “Son, what’s so exciting about all of this?” And he says, “Dad, with this much horse manure, there’s got to be a pony in there somewhere.”", "My point is simply this: As much as the Liberals want to give a pony to everyone in this particular budget, I’m sad to say that there’s way too much manure to wade through to get to that. This budget is simply an election ploy for the Liberals. They’re giving everything to everyone. They initially had promised balance, and now it’s $6.7 billion that they’re adding on. They’re going to end up borrowing a total of roughly $32 billion: “Let’s just put it on our credit card.” Well, guess what,? That credit card is already over its limit." ],

That’s a big savings for a senior who’s on four or five drugs and pays $20 for drugs. They look at that as a benefit to them. They asked about the $750. They ask me, “Does that mean that if I’m over 75 I will be able to get my grass cut out of this money?

It’s called, Hey, Big Spender. I want to talk first about the election document that’s here and then I will talk specifically about Bill 31. Both of these are government documents. I call it an election document, Speaker, even though the government refers to it as their 2018 budget. But that book is absolute proof that this Liberal government will say anything, do anything and promise anything to cling to power.", "Speaker, just months after promising balanced budgets for years to come, the government would plunge Ontario families into six more years of deficits just to announce a series of expensive election promises—because that’s all these are. We’ll prove that when we get to the discussion of the actual bill document.", "These promises are designed to fix the problems created by the government in the first place. Through cuts and inaction, the government created a crisis in mental health. Because of skyrocketing hydro, cap-and-trade and increased fees and taxes, families are facing challenges with child care and other costs. Seniors deserve the best health care possible, but weren’t receiving it. They’ve had 15 years to address these problems, but chose to show they “care” only weeks before the election.", "So let’s talk first about the things we know are in the actual budget and in the bill. That starts with personal income taxes. They’re raised, Speaker. What the government failed to announce when they read their document about the budget—they announced a lot of programs that are not going to be in the bill, but what they failed to announce, but what forms a major part of their budget, are $2 billion in new taxes on families and businesses, and skyrocketing debt that will further dilute the services families expect.", "In Ontario, there are currently five personal income tax brackets and two surtax brackets, and they are charged once you eclipse a certain amount of annual income. But the government is removing the two surtax brackets and instead creating seven tax brackets. This will raise taxes on an additional 1.8 million Ontarians by $200 each, and this personal income tax will take $275 million out of families’ pockets.", "There are also business tax increases. The government is adding to the employer health tax, impacting 20,000 businesses. Medium-sized businesses will each pay an additional $2,400 every year. That’s $45 million more in taxes. The government will also match the recent federal government tax changes, including reducing tax exemptions on passive income. That’s a fancy way of saying hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes to small business will be collected by this government.", "Altogether, the tax increases are $2 billion over the next three years: $510 million this year out of your pocket, $715 million next year, and $780 million the following year.", "But what’s really interesting in this budget is the small print, and it has to do with what the last Liberal speaker was talking about. It’s on page 224, down at the bottom, in the very small print. For those of you who want to go online, on page 224, it’s on the right-hand side, the third line up from the bottom. It’s one word, and it says “efficiencies.” So the government is admitting there are efficiencies to be found in the budget. In fact, they are planning $1.425 billion worth of efficiencies, to be precise.", "Now, annualized over the four-year term of the government, that first year of efficiencies alone will bring in $5.7 billion. When you find the same amount of efficiencies the second year and annualize that—that means years two, three, and four—that’s another $4.275 billion. And in the third and fourth years, that totals $14.4 billion in annualized “efficiencies” this government is promising.", "When we here in the official opposition use the phrase, “We are going to find efficiencies,” the government screams, “Cuts. It’s going be cuts.” But when they find more efficiencies in their own budget, they explain that “Well, no, these are transformations.” They’re finding savings.

They talked about seniors, they talked about other areas of child care, they talked about health care—it’s all talk. They talked about drugs, prescription care, mental health care and care for dental health, but it’s all talk. Because when you open the actual budget bill, the one that we’re going to vote on, none of those funding announcements that we’ve just outlined are in the bill. Not one of those so-called care items is in the bill.", "Instead, this bill is, as the analysts and as the ministry personnel called it, very consequential. It’s a lot of housekeeping. We can change the words “police force” to “police service.” It’s this kind of housekeeping that is in this entire binder. You do not find dental care. You do not find health care. You do not find child care in this document. This is what we’re voting on. This is the budget bill, not the speech that we had from the minister or the Premier who is out on the talking circuit. She can talk about care, but the only thing she cares about is getting re-elected.", "Here’s what is in the budget. It’s things like the Assessment Act, the City of Toronto Act, the automobile insurance act—of course, we recall the discussion on automobile insurance in an earlier budget, in the 2013 budget, when the Liberal government promised that they would reduce insurance by 15% by August 2015. That’s what they announced back then, and of course we know that the Premier called it her famous “stretch goal.” But it’s back in here. Now, they did hit a 5.5% reduction; that’s a far cry from 15%, and that’s a far cry from 2015, so that is just an absolute out-and-out issue.", "There’s the Corporations Act, the Corporations Tax Act, the Credit Unions and Caisses Populaires Act—you’re going to continue here—the Labour Relations Act, the Law Society Act, the Loan and Trust Corporations Act and the Pension Benefits Act. You’re going to get into the Ontario Loan Act, the Pooled Registered Pension Plans Act, the Police Services Act, the Revenue Integrity Act, the Solicitors Act, the Tobacco Tax Act and the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act.", "This is what this is: It’s a technical document. Many, many times throughout the briefing, the good people from the ministry would say, “Well, this is another one of these sort of consequential areas. It’s just housekeeping.” Again, nothing that the Premier has promised is mentioned in the bill that she is passing. You would think, Speaker, that if the government was even remotely serious about implementing any of the promises they made to seniors, parents, the disabled and others, they would get started immediately.", "They talk an awful lot about mental health. I can tell you that there are members here in the gallery from all three parties who were on the pre-budget consultations, and when we were in Sudbury we heard from somebody who had attempted suicide. It was very brave of them to stand in front of us and talk to an audience, knowing that it was being filmed and streamed live, knowing that every word was recorded and their name was out there. It was brave of them to stand there and tell us about their attempt at suicide. They were saved.", "But every one of them, this first one especially, told us that there’s nothing in place to help them. If you show up at the hospital with a broken leg, you’re going to get a cast. Your leg is on the way to being fixed, and out you go. But this Liberal government treats mental health differently. You’re going to attempt suicide, and you get an appointment in six months. Another one told us 12 months, and one told us 18 months.", "So we went to Ottawa, and there was another brave person who stood up in front of that same committee with the cameras, clerks taking notes, Hansard recording every word, and the legal department was there. They were brave to tell us about their attempt at committing suicide. Luckily they were saved, and again they told us, “There was nothing for me at the hospital when I presented myself.”", "But sadly, Speaker, the third one that we heard from we had to hear from the hospital administrator. Very tragically, they told us the story of the person who had presented themselves in the emergency, and when they realized “no hope,” they committed suicide in the parking lot of the hospital. There is such a huge demand for care, but it can’t be hollow words. If you’re going to tell the people, if you’re going to tell seniors and families and all other groups, organizations and individuals about care, well, you’d darn well better put it in the bill that we’re going to pass.", "We’ve only got a dozen or more—16, maybe—sitting days before we’re gone into the election. The writ will be called on May 9 and the election will be on June 7—these are our presumptions. Speaker, there’s no care in the bill. They don’t care. They only care about one aspect of the bill, which I’ll get to in a moment.", "Again, Speaker, if you think that the government was serious, even for a moment, about implementing any of the promises they made, they should have gotten started immediately. They might have actually put some of these things—one of these things—in the bill that we’re debating. Many of our days between now and when we rise are going to get eaten up debating this bill. I can tell you one thing that we will be able to talk about, and it’s what they actually did put in the bill: all of their tax increases. Those, remarkably, made it into the bill. They thought enough about their election document to make sure that the taxes that they promised got in the bill, but none of the other promises have made it into the bill.", "There’s no time to be wasted before the tax increases will make it into law. They’re going to see to that. They’re going to see to the fact that those tax increases will make it into law before we rise; those, they saw.", "It’s really interesting, Speaker. I want to talk about a couple of specifics. If you go to the back of the book here, right at the end of the book, on page 307, the last page that has any writing on it at all, the last possible chance for you to read exhaustively through 307 pages, you finally come to the one last thing. There’s one really interesting word that’s in here. That word alone speaks volumes. The word is “likely.” They’ve added this word “likely.”", "It brings into law—this is their bill. Schedule 3 is what it’s called. They made sure they got that in there as well. This change gives the government a very wide latitude to divert the cap-and-trade revenue to projects that are “reasonably likely” to reduce greenhouse gases.", "I’ve stood in this Legislature time and time again talking about the fact that they have a little clause in last year’s budget, and the year before and the year before that, first for the sale of Hydro One, to divert the revenue from Hydro One. If you remember, Speaker, they announced that the sale was so they can take that money and put it into infrastructure. If only that were the case, because they put a clause in there that allowed them to pay for any of their other announcements that were even remotely related.", "They thought, “Wow. We pulled the wool over the taxpayers’ eyes once; let’s do it again. We’ll use the same schedule to fool the people on the cap-and-trade tax as well.” The same clause, that cap-and-trade tax—the revenue can be used to pay for already approved, already announced projects. They got away with it again. We talk about it and talk about it. It’s interesting that they now have gone to even—I’ll call it “lower depths”; I was going to call it “new highs” in figuring out how to pull the wool, but I’ll call it a lower depth that they’ve gone to.", "Again, their announcement on the cap-and-trade tax was justified, according to them, because they were going to use that money for infrastructure. Then we find out, of course, in the fine print in the last budget, that money can be for infrastructure that is unrelated; it can be for any road, any highway, any public transit, those types of things.", "Very deep into this last page of the budget, it actually says, “Amendment of two subsections of the Climate Change Mitigation and Low‐carbon Economy Act, 2016, with respect to the reimbursement of expenditures incurred by the crown”—that’s what they got away with last time; now it’s “for the purposes of funding initiatives that are reasonably likely to reduce” greenhouse gases. That’s just an open season that they’re going to pay for bills that are unrelated because there’s no legal definition of “reasonably likely.” So here we go.", "Speaker, as you get into the bill, the actual bill here, you realize that they also have another clause that they’ve put in here. This one is even more amazing. They are going to pay for $366,445,123 worth of expenses that they paid for in 2015. They are now going to be able to backdate this to pay for those bills because they want to include these somehow. Speaker, this is before the act was ever written—they’re now paying for bills that occurred. This is before cap-and-trade was discussed. They’re paying $336 million worth of 2015 bills. That’s this wool over the eyes that they like to do, Speaker. This goes all the way back to 2015 now, and they said, “Oh, no, no, no. Don’t worry. It’s just a timing issue.” A timing issue? It’s 2018, for heaven’s sake, and they call these “surgical amendments.” Yes, I can understand that surgery is necessary to slice and put this in.", "Speaker, I guess it’s more timely to mention that even though they have all these cap-and-trade funds, and they have to go back to 2015 to find something to have spent it on, when we got public accounts this year, it was really fascinating to see that $3 billion was left unspent in our infrastructure fund. In fact, if you go back three years, over $6 billion was left unspent in the infrastructure fund. It is shocking that they can’t even figure out how to get these projects. We call a lot of it photo-op environmentalism. They like to announce a project and have a picture taken. Again, it’s all aspirational and never operational. They like to have a picture, send out a press release and have lots of fanfare, but to actually get her done, it doesn’t happen. They don’t know how to get it done. That money is left unspent, even with all of these changes in the design of how they have manipulated the cap-and-trade funds.", "That’s a bit of a rundown on the election document that we have, all 307 pages of it. I might refer later to some of the other areas that I have marked in a bit of a synopsis. I’ve also talked about what’s not in the bill. Here we are. We’re supposed to be here to debate the budget bill—there’s nothing to talk about. I know they talked about it, but it’s not in the bill. The home care, dental care: None of that is in the bill.", "We always said, right at the beginning, “That’s never going to happen. They’re making this up.” So, Speaker, let’s look at some of the comments that came in the media the day of and the day after the budget was read in the Legislature. The post-budget headlines basically instantly captured the sentiment that took place across Ontario. Here are some of them, and these are quotes:", "—“Spending Taps Open.”", "—“Brace Yourself, Ontario.”", "—“How Much Will All the ‘Freebies’ … Cost?”", "—“Election Free-for-All Costs Us All.”", "—“More Spending, More Fiscal Problems, More Debt.”", "—And another quote: “Too Much for Voters to Swallow.”", "Interesting. I read the Toronto Star’s comments earlier, which were probably the most stinging. They knew what they were up to, and they outed them. They said it was too good to be true, and as it turns out, none of it was true. None of it is in the bill.", "So, as is the custom after the budget is read, the minister gets on TVOntario and The Agenda and gives his version, and then the finance critics follow and give our version. It was quite fascinating. The only phrase I could use would be unparliamentary, Speaker, so I’m going to move on.", "I’ll tell you what the minister said. He was filmed in his office across the street in Frost Block, so he wasn’t in the studio and we didn’t get a chance to speak directly to him. His segment was filmed in Frost Block, and we were watching from the studio. I have got to tell you, my jaw dropped, because he said, “The government has slayed the deficit.” Then he went on to say, “We’ve balanced the books.” Again, my jaw dropped. Then he went on to say—these are all direct quotes, and he’s talking about new jobs here—“We’re projecting 140,000 jobs every year.” Then he has another quote: “We are the top in foreign direct investment” and “Our debt-to-GDP remains the same and will be tapering down.” I have given you five quotes, word for word, verbatim from the transcript of TVOntario’s The Agenda the night of the budget.", "I don’t know what book the minister was reading. I don’t know if he actually read the budget. I know he read his speech on the budget, but certainly if he looked at the actual budget document with the Ministry of Finance’s data in it, he would realize that he should not have said any of those five items. Here’s why: because none of them are accurate or remotely accurate. In fact, Speaker, the polar opposite of any of those statements would indeed be accurate. Let’s just take a moment, and we’ll go through them one by one, because I know how much you enjoy that, Speaker.", "I ask, how can the deficit be “slayed” when the budget itself reveals deficits for the next six years? We have a deficit for six more years. How can you possibly say the deficit was “slayed”? That means, “It’s killed. It’s gone. It doesn’t exist. We’re done. We’re finished with it. Look at us; aren’t we great?” Wrong.", "Then he said, “We’ve balanced....” Well, that is another pipe dream, because the books today are artificially balanced, if you do a whole bunch of things. First of all, take all of your reserves and put them back in: $643 million in surplus according to the document, but $600 million gone from the reserves. That’s one.", "Let’s look at the Auditor General, who also said the IESO, the pension money and the so-called fair hydro plan are not included. So if you don’t include things that are Canadian standards in terms of accounting practices, as the auditor said, and if you are leaning towards having an opinion from the auditor that says your books are bogus, which she has said, then I guess it’s artificially balanced somehow, if you just don’t include all the other expenses. You can just keep pulling expenses that you don’t like out of there. That doesn’t really make it balanced, Speaker. That makes it bogus, and I guess that’s why the auditor qualified her opinion twice and has said that she is very seriously looking at an adverse opinion this time.", "Those are two that have nothing to do with reality. Then the minister said, “We are going to create 140,000 jobs every year.” Those were his words. Well, in his book, if you go and actually read this book, on page 193 they say that their forecast is to create 128,000 jobs, followed by 121,000 jobs. The next year it tumbles to 77,000 jobs, and then it settles down at 62,000 jobs. Again, nowhere in here is his number of 140,000 ever mentioned. It certainly won’t be 140,000 every year, when he’s down to 62,000 two years from now, in 2020. So there’s three times that the minister looked in the camera and told us something where the actual opposite of that something is more correct.", "Then he said, “We are the top in foreign direct investment.” Well, Speaker, at one time, before electricity rates were skyrocketing, before businesses were strangled with red tape, before—as the chair of Fiat Chrysler, Sergio Marchionne told us—you made Ontario the most expensive jurisdiction in North America in which to do business, yes, at one time, we were indeed the top destination for foreign direct investment, but we’ve fallen to third. We are no longer the top. We were in that prime spot, and then the Liberal government took over and brought in all of these job-killing programs. We’re not number one anymore.", "In fact, I could extend that into the mining sector. When this government took office, we were the number-1 jurisdiction in mining in the world—the number-1 mining jurisdiction on the entire planet. Today? No. We’re not number 2 or 3; we’re number 18, because you can’t get permits in this province in a timely manner. It is this government’s red tape and skyrocketing hydro bills that make Ontario unattractive for business.", "I mentioned in the Legislature recently, and I’ll repeat it again, that he says here that we’re number 1; we’re not. Ontario is not. Look at Google and Amazon. Both recently announced their first-ever data centre locations in Canada. Did they pick Ontario? No, they both went to Quebec. Why? They both cited lower hydro rates in Quebec, and one of them cited that Ontario is the second-most expensive jurisdiction in North America to do business. So they did not bring those jobs and that wealth to Ontario; they went next door to Quebec. We are no longer the number-1 destination for foreign capital, so he is wrong about that.", "Speaker, he talked about our debt to GDP. His quote specifically was, “Our debt to GDP remains the same and will be tapering down.” That’s his quote. Well, let’s look at the book again and get the facts." ],

It is expected to rise to 38.2% in 2019-20, and 38.6% the year after that. How can the minister say that it remains the same, when it went up, and that it will be tapering down, when it’s still going up? That’s incorrect, and again, the absolute polar opposite of what he said is true.", "Speaker, this is the Minister of Finance. This is the representative of the government who only four hours after he started reading the budget went on television and told five items that are absolutely painting a picture of Ontario that does not exist. None of those are correct. I would defy anybody in the Liberal government to challenge these. Here’s his statement and here’s his book. I am reading you the facts out of the book, unless they’ve printed something in the book wrong. If they’d like to retract and issue an appended book, that may be something to see, but right now we’ve got 307 pages. Other than the areas the Auditor General said are bogus, we have to presume that their own debt-to-GDP—because these numbers aren’t falling; they’re rising. If they were going to fudge them, Speaker, they would at least have put a lower number in, not a higher number in. But he goes on television and tells us five things that are opposite of facts.", "Early in my remarks, I mentioned that none of the funding announcements that were in the budget made it into this actual bill. It’s interesting, Speaker: On TVOntario, after the minister spoke, I referred to these five correct versions. I corrected the minister’s record for him.

Their number 4 top-10 highlight—this is from the government’s own release—is the seniors’ healthy home program, which they announced and which, of course, is just another announcement, not a real program. The most interesting thing about this top-10 budget highlight is that it specifically states it’s designed for seniors to help them “live independently.” I’d just like us to remember those few words: to help them “live independently.”", "This is this brand new program that they announced. Now, funny thing, sadly, is that in 2017 they had cancelled a similar healthy homes tax credit that was designed to help seniors live independently. So they announced one, but they had just cancelled a similar one.", "The reason they cancelled the program was actually in last year’s budget: “The credit has had significantly lower take-up than projected and provides little support to lower-income seniors.” So they turfed the program, lo and behold, only to have it reappear magically this year as a new program to help seniors live independently.", "It’s really fascinating that they can do this. They must think that we don’t read. They must think Google doesn’t exist. Well, actually, it doesn’t exist in data centres in Ontario, as I talked about. That is exactly why we said that they never delivered a budget; they delivered an election document and no more. None of that is real.", "I was talking earlier about the Toronto Star. They wrote a further editorial, and it was fascinating. It was entitled, “Ontario Liberals’ Ambitious Budget May Be Too Much for Voters to Swallow.” Earlier, when I read “too much to swallow,” they said it was a right-leaning newspaper that had said that. Obviously, I’m now letting you know that that specific quote is from the Toronto Star.", "“So much at such a ... cost will strain the credulity of voters, who may well wonder why the Liberals didn’t do more during their 15 years in office.” That’s a quote from the Toronto Star. They really spent some time on this editorial.", "They go on to discuss the importance of many of the ambitious programs, but they deduce that “these aren’t announcements from a government with a clear path to turning them into reality.” Well, does that ever sound familiar. We had said exactly the same thing. They’re great-sounding, they’re aspirational-sounding, and they’re not operational because they ain’t ever gonna do them. At least now we know that we weren’t alone in suggesting that they’re never going to turn these into reality.", "The Toronto Star goes so far as to conclude, “With election day ... just over two months away, voters are bound to see them for what they are—$20.3 billion worth of promises from a government and party fighting desperately against the odds for re-election.” Well, Speaker, I’m certainly glad that we have this from the Toronto Star, and from many others you’re going to hear in a moment. We’re pleased that we’re not alone in our thinking.", "The pile-on continued as RBC Economic Research prepared a sobering budget report entitled Deficits by Choice. It’s an interesting title, because they conclude that a return to deficit is a matter of choice. “The cumulative deficit over the coming three years totals $19.8 billion,” approximately the same amount equal to the government’s $20.3 billion in newly announced initiatives. They say, “What is worrying about this plan is … most of the measures … are recurring entitlements. It makes the … choice fraught with risk.”", "It’s very interesting. They’ve really narrowed down and shown us that this is going to be built into the budget now permanently.", "While the government offers a return to balance in seven years, “there are no details on how they will achieve it. This is concerning since so much spending … kicks in late in the fiscal plan…. Six more years of deficits may be optimistic.”", "And like virtually all analysts, they ended with, “If Ontario is running large deficits when the economy is performing at capacity, what happens if a recession comes along? A pre-existing deficit and an elevated debt burden will limit the government’s ability to respond and virtually guarantee a rapidly deteriorating fiscal situation.”", "Of more concern should be the warnings from the credit rating and bond rating agencies. Both Moody’s and DBRS immediately issued warnings to the Ontario government over their plan to run deficits for the next several years. The two credit rating agencies said that the fiscal plan, which includes billions in new spending, would harm the province over the long term.", "Moody’s Investor Service led off with: The return to deficit spending is “credit negative”—that’s an important term in ratings—“as it raises the likelihood that the province faces a structural deficit, in addition to increasing our forecast of the debt burden to accommodate the associated new borrowing.” That is very alarming and very serious.", "DBRS followed with: “It demonstrates in the clearest terms that the province is not committed to disciplined … fiscal policy.” While both agencies stopped short of downgrading Ontario, they shared that Ontario’s “creditworthiness could come under pressure” as a consequence of returning to deficits.", "As mentioned earlier, a deficit would likely weigh in on Ontario bonds as well. And that’s exactly what occurred, Speaker. When Ontario and Quebec offered up their bonds at the beginning of the month, Quebec came out on top, selling their securities at a spread of eight basis points, closer to the federal benchmark than Ontario. Quebec sold $500 million of their 2.75% bonds at 65.5 basis points above the federal government bonds, while Ontario sold $750 million of their bonds at 73.5 basis points over that benchmark. All the bonds had a maturity date that was similar.", "Why did Quebec win out? Well, Speaker, I can tell you: They outlined a plan to deliver a balanced budget for five consecutive years, to pay down debt and to lower taxes for small businesses. In contrast, Ontario will plunge us into six years of deficits, add billions in debt and increase business taxes.", "Robert Kavcic at BMO summed it up with, “Quebec has made meaningful progress on its fiscal situation, while Ontario has done little else but spend the recent economic windfall.”", "The cumulative effect of Ontario’s record high input costs caused the Ontario Chamber of Commerce to weigh in. They have asked the government to rescind the small business tax increases included in the 2018 budget: “At a time when industry in Ontario is feeling the impact of the rising minimum wage, significant labour reforms, increasing global and US competition, and rising input costs, we need government to reduce the cumulative burden not add to it,” said Rocco Rossi, the president. The chamber called on the government to remove the two proposed tax reforms that will cost employers nearly half a billion dollars in new taxes, $2 billion over three years.", "Now, the government, as you can tell, doesn’t acknowledge the fiscal imbalance that they and they alone have created, nor do they understand the trouble that they have caused in the marketplace. Perhaps the 51,000 job losses in January should have given them some signal that there’s trouble. The early April numbers are also out, Speaker. Exports continued to fall; exports decreased in February. Small business confidence continues to fall. It fell to 57.1 on the index, from 59. Toronto home sales were down 39.5% compared with a year ago. This is a lack of confidence in the economy in Ontario.", "The fact that this government themselves have told us that they expect—even with the tax increase of half a billion dollars, they still expect $1 billion in lower revenue from the taxes on corporations this year because of the economic conditions—that’s in their own books—they and they alone have forced on the business community in Ontario.", "Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to have this hour to present the facts, and I want one closing comment: Change is on the way." ],

He shared that the budget wasn’t truly balanced because they put money on to OPG’s books for this fair hydro plan.", "At the end of the day, this is truly a budget document, but it’s an election promises document to try to cling to power. We are going to be in tougher shape because of this budget, and I believe the people of Ontario know better." ],

  "text" : [ "I listened with some interest to the comments from the member from Nipissing, the leader of the official opposition, who clearly has deep knowledge of financial issues. He studies the Auditor General’s reports. He’s clearly studied the budget document. That does make me wonder what he thinks of the current plans of his leader to privatize whatever he can get his hands on, to leave no stone unturned in that quest to privatize government services. This member knows the Auditor General has shown that privatization, the P3 model, cost people in this province $8 billion more than was necessary, that privatization cost the taxpayer in the long run. So I wonder what he thinks about that.", "I also wonder what he thinks about the commitment to make a 4% across-the-board budget reduction to every ministry in this province, when he knows that health care is in dire crisis in Ontario because of the actions of the Liberal government in failing to address the people who are lined up on stretchers in hospitals across this province, from Ottawa to Windsor, from London to Sudbury. How he thinks that the PCs can address this crisis in hallway medicine with a 4% across-the-board budget reduction, with $6 billion of cuts to the provincial treasury, is just inexplicable to me. That member will have to do some explaining as to how those books are going to work out, because you simply cannot remove that volume of revenues from the provincial treasury and still address the pressing needs of the people of this province around health care, pharmacare and many other things." ],

I presented 60 minutes’ worth of data and statistics, but it all boils down to what has really happened in the province of Ontario, the Ontario that we live in today. All of these numbers, we’re going to debate back and forth. I’ll stick with the Auditor General and her numbers, but we’re going to debate that back and forth. I’m certain of that, Speaker.", "But what we can’t debate back and forth is the fact that we do have people who are lined up in the hallways of hospitals. When I was knocking on doors a couple of weeks ago, the first door I knocked on—I had CBC cameras with me; they had asked if they could follow. I said, “You pick the doors to knock on. You tell me what subdivision to go to, you tell me what door to knock on, and I’ll knock on the door.” They came behind me as we knocked on the first door, and the woman was still in her scrubs. She’s a nurse. I’d never met her before. I asked her if the CBC could tape us, and she said yes.", "She told us the story about that night’s shift and the fact that they needed a bed for a patient. They ended up converting a closet. So something that was a closet one hour is now a bed, and four hours later the patient was admitted and put in this closet. That’s the Ontario that Kathleen Wynne has created.", "We can dispute all these numbers back and forth, but it comes right down to real people with real lives and real situations, and there’s no disputing the fact that Kathleen Wynne has made life harder for people in Ontario. That is indisputable, Speaker." ],

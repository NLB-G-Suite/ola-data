  "text" : [ "It will be a pleasure to talk about Bill 178. I had a little bit of time yesterday to basically explain that we are talking about the Smoke-Free Ontario Act at the same time that a mega change is coming in our country. This mega change, we all know what that is. It is that using cannabis will become legal in our country, and that means it will become legal in our province. There is a huge, pent-up demand from people who want this to happen. That’s fine. It will be happening. It’s a promise that was made.", "But, Speaker, everybody understands that the Smoke-Free Ontario Act and the Smoke-Free Ontario Strategy are to help people quit smoking. It’s to make sure that new people do not pick up the habit and become the next generation of smokers. We all get this. I dream of the day when we have an end strategy—and believe me, Speaker, this is coming. Soon we will have an end strategy in our province so that nobody picks up smoking anymore and nobody smokes anymore. I think I will see this in my lifetime.", "But here we are, expecting a change in law that will legalize cannabis for recreational use, and we are debating this bill called the Smoke-Free Ontario Act. Why are we debating this bill? Because the Liberal government refused to listen. We just debated that bill about a year ago. We debated it at length, but throughout all of this, the Liberal government had already made up their minds as to what they wanted to see in this bill. They did not listen to the thousands of people who sent emails. They did not listen to the hundreds of people who came and made deputations. They did not listen to the members of the opposition. They did not take any of our amendments.", "And now, a couple months after we did all this work on the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, they realized, “Look at this. We didn’t get it right. We need to change four words.” But in order to change four words in the bill, you have to go through first reading, second reading, public consultation, third reading—which we’re doing now—and royal assent, which will come as soon as our Lieutenant Governor comes back.", "This is all time wasted because we have this huge change coming to our province where a lot of people who are non-smokers right now—they’re not cigarette smokers, but they are marijuana smokers. And now, we will make that legal. That’s good and that’s fine. The people of Ontario have been asking for that change for a very long time. But how about, as government, we take our responsibility seriously and look at this through a public health lens? How about, as the Liberal government, showing they take this responsibility seriously? At least have their eyes open to see the tsunami coming toward us of increasing smoking.", "There are lots of drugs where I come from. Lots of people smoke cannabis right now illegally, and they’re all very much looking forward to doing this legally. But what will that mean, Speaker? Most of them, when they roll, roll with tobacco. As you make it legal, as you make it more accessible, as you make it more available, what are you doing? You are not only allowing people to smoke cannabis more freely—all good with that—you’re also putting a lot of people at risk of becoming tobacco smokers once again because it is a whole lot easier to roll a joint when you mix it with tobacco. It holds better. It rolls better. This is what everybody does.", "The public health effect of this is well known and well documented. You read the Toronto Public Health report that was just released on May 13, or any other public health report, and you will see it there. The crossover from marijuana to tobacco is there; it’s real. Rather than seeing smoking rates go down, we will see them go up. All of this is preventable if the Liberals will only listen.", "We have this bill. It will be voted on at noon today. It will pass. But even after all of this, the regulations are still not ready. So now we will have a bill that says “and other prescribed substances”—four words. Although we’ve known for a long time that those four words needed to be added so that we can deal with cannabis, the regulations are not ready. They’ve had two years to get the regulations ready.", "They will blame us for slowing down the bill. To what avail? The bill will pass this afternoon. The Lieutenant Governor is not here to proclaim royal assent. But it makes no difference because the regulations that will describe what those other prescribed substances are—because the bill doesn’t say “marijuana”; it says “and other prescribed substances.” The other prescribed substances—we all know it means marijuana—will be defined in regulations that are not ready.", "Meanwhile, you have smoking businesses and marijuana businesses opening everywhere. I think on the last count, we’re at 83 just in downtown Toronto. You can go to any little city, including my own, and the people are way ahead of the government, although the government knows full well that this is a very big threat to public health. Why are they not acting?", "Whenever I ask, they say, “We’re waiting for the federal government’s change in legislation.” Really, Speaker? You cannot do an education campaign to show children, youth and their families that marijuana is not without risk? Really? You need to have the federal government pass a law? Do you really think that, no matter what is in that law, the health effects on young, developing minds will change? None of this will change.", "Rather than using millions of dollars to tell us that the health care system is fine, our hospitals are doing well, our home care system is perfect and our long-term-care system is no-fail, use that money to educate people. Use that money to educate our youth so they know: Marijuana, absolutely, is way safer than tobacco—we know that—but it is not without risk. It is not without risk for the developing mind, for the developing brain. The body of evidence is pretty good on that. It has an effect. It has an effect on lowering IQ. It lowers the ability of the brain to develop language skills and many others. It has an effect on mental health for youth. We’ll see more depression, more suicide and more severe mental health illnesses, like bipolar disorder, if youth start to use legalized marijuana.", "Don’t go out with the usual, “Drugs are bad,” because we all know that doesn’t work. There are evidence-based ways to make sure that youth understand the risks and youth understand a moderate way to take advantage of this new product. Educate youth and educate their parents. Do a strong and robust health promotion campaign.", "I was in Estimates yesterday, so I took the opportunity to ask how much money has been put aside for the campaign. You’ll be happy to know, Speaker, that it is zero. Not one dollar has been put aside to do this education. Why? The answer I got is that they’re waiting for the federal government to change the law.", "What do changing a law and educating people about the health effects of recreational cannabis have in common? Apparently, for the Liberals, those two are linked. For the rest of the people in this province, they are not. The health effects of cannabis do not change whether it is legal or illegal. They stay exactly the same, and a good health promotion campaign needs to happen so that people know that, and so that parents know so they can guide their children. To say that we’re going to wait before we do anything—there are responsibilities that fall upon us. We have a bill in front of us. Why aren’t we doing that?", "The federal government is not going to say what the age of sale is. For example, there are people who say that it should be 25 because of the health effects on the young mind. Others say, “Other jurisdictions put it at 21. It should be 21.” Others say it should be 19, the same as alcohol. Why aren’t we having those conversations? Why are we allowing this huge vacuum where nobody talks?", "When the government doesn’t show leadership and doesn’t show they have a plan for this tsunami coming at us, then other people take the lead, and unfortunately, most of the other people who have taken the lead have taken the lead in a way in which they could cash in on that, that they could get rich, that they could make money, that they could make a living, that they could make a business. There’s nothing wrong with that. It is okay to make a living, and it’s okay to have a business, but it is not okay for the government to sit back and be silent when there are hundreds of thousands of Ontarians who want their government to speak up, when there are hundreds of thousands of Ontarians who want to know how the system is going to work so they can be part of it, so they can develop an economy, so they can make a living out of it, and so they can be farmers and distributors. But none of this is known, because we’re waiting for the federal government.", "I’m sorry, but the federal government is not going to tell us what the age for people to have access is going to be. Because the age for alcohol varies from one province to the next, they’re going to stay out of this. The federal government is not going to tell us what the distribution system is going to look like in our province, because this is our responsibility to take, but the Liberals are quite happy to sit and let this happen.", "Then they say, “Oh, but we care about public health, and we care about people stopping smoking, and we’re very proud of our Smoke-Free Ontario Act,” when really, when they have an opportunity to be proactive, to show leadership, it is radio silence on this side. This is not acceptable, Speaker. This is not acceptable at all.", "I want a clear communication plan. I want to know what the availability and accessibility of this new substance will be like. We talk a lot about the cannabis control board of Ontario, basically aligned with the liquor board of Ontario. Lots of people talk about that, except for government. What is the end goal going to be? Right now, if you look at alcohol or tobacco—because we’re talking about the Smoke-Free Ontario Act—the main goal at the end of the day for the government is to cash in. If you look at the LCBO, it generates over a billion dollars in revenues for the government. If you look at the taxes on tobacco in Ontario, they also generate billions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues for the government. Is this the path that we’re going to take with this new drug, this drug that’s going to be legalized? Is this the path that we want, the path that is driven by commercialization? Maybe. But why is it that we don’t know?", "Why is it that when I ask the Ministry of Health, they tell us, “Oh, no, we’re going to take a path of health first. We understand the effect that legalization will have on public health, and we’re taking our responsibility seriously by doing nothing,” by bringing the Smoke-Free Ontario Act back to this Legislature year after year to add four words. I want more than four words when the Smoke-Free Ontario Act comes in front of this House. I want this bill to make sure that we look forward, that we show leadership, that we know that there is a huge potential of increased smokers in Ontario and that we will show that we want to help people quit smoking and we don’t want people to smoke more.", "A lot of people are saying that there are other ways right now. Most of the people who use cannabis smoke it. But there are other ways to use those substances. One way is through edibles. Why don’t we have a clear policy that says, “If you’re going to smoke recreational cannabis, it’s going to be more expensive than if you consume it in a way that doesn’t promote smoking,” to make it clear that this substance is going to be legal. If you want to use it, go right at it, but the edibles, the drinkables, the chewies, the vapour, all of the other forms of consuming cannabis will be cheaper for the same effect than if you smoke it. This is a way to clearly show to people that it is a legal product. You are allowed to use it. You use it within guidelines, which I hope will be coming out soon—but it’s not soon enough. People want to know now. It is not like it’s a brand new substance; it has been there forever, and hundreds of thousands of Ontarians use it. Why is it that it is radio silence on this side? Why is it that I have a bill in front of me that doesn’t talk about this, as if it does not exist? I can’t stand that, Speaker. I can’t stand that.", "I was not always a politician. I worked in health promotion for a long time. We know that changing people’s behaviour requires a tonne of work, and to do that tonne of work, you need time. It’s not after the bill from the federal government is presented and tabled and debated that will be the time to start doing education. Now is the time. But there is no work plan. There is no direction. There is nothing. We have a bill that changes four words. That’s what we have.", "Canada is about to become the second country in the world to legalize non-medical cannabis. We are the biggest province in this country, and we are doing nothing: no strong regulatory framework in sight, nothing in this bill we are putting forward.", "People will know that whether you talk about marijuana, hashish or hash oil, it all comes from the cannabis plant. The cannabis plant has more than 61 chemicals called cannabinoids, all within the plant. The main psychoactive ingredient is THC. If anybody is interested, THC is short for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol—THC is a lot easier. But it also contains what is called CBD. This is the cannabidiol. This product does not have any psychoactive effect, but it does help with pain management and has been approved in a pill form to help people with MS.", "The medical use of marijuana and cannabis will also have to be looked at, because right now, there are a lot of people who seem to qualify for a prescription for medical marijuana. I would tell you by experience that some of those people got prescriptions for medical marijuana in circumstances that are hard to justify from a health point of view. I can tell of an example of somebody who has gingivitis. That qualifies for a medical marijuana prescription. There is no best practice that shows that marijuana is effective, there is no link between this disease and treatment with marijuana, but you can go into this doctor’s office and get a prescription.", "I’m telling you that because medical marijuana is there and will continue to be there. As we roll out those new regulations for the legalization of cannabis throughout Ontario, all of those have to be taken into account: the fact that there is a pent-up demand, the fact that it does have an effect on the developing brain, the fact that it is not without harm.", "You realize, Speaker, that when people smoke marijuana, although they may not smoke it as often as people smoke cigarettes, they will take a breath and they hold their breath so that they can maximize the effect of the THC. If there is tobacco in that joint—and most of the time there is—what does that mean? That means that the tobacco is also held in your lungs for longer. I hope that I don’t have to explain to anybody that tobacco smoke has a harmful effect on human lungs. Tobacco is the only product that will kill half of its users if it’s used as directed. Tobacco is the only product that kills half of its users.", "So here you have a new form of smoking that will become more and more prevalent once recreational marijuana becomes legalized, where the way you smoke changes for the worse, if you look at lung health. I see that one of my colleagues who is very passionate about lung health is here.", "What are we doing? Absolutely nothing. We’re changing four words in a bill to say “and other prescribed substances.” Those prescribed substances have to be defined in regulation. We’ve known this for two years, and yet the regulations are not ready. Meanwhile, a lot of good, hard-working people who are starting to open up smoking lounges, dispensaries and all of this are being dragged through the courts and have police coming down on them because we have this vacuum of direction coming from Queen’s Park. This has to change.", "The NDP is on record forever on end saying that we should decriminalize recreational marijuana. Nothing good comes from making criminals out of recreational marijuana users. Once a person goes through the courts and, God forbid, ends up in jail, you will bring hardship onto those people for the rest of their lives. The punishment far outweighs what we were ever trying to do. I will make a parenthesis on that. Although the NDP has always been for decriminalizing marijuana forever on end, there will still be a criminal offence if you drive under the influence of cannabis and under the influence of marijuana.", "How proactive are we on educating people on that? How ready are we, as a province, to deal with that? Not whatsoever, Speaker, not whatsoever. Yet it is quite clear that people who drive under the influence of marijuana have twice the chance of getting into an accident while driving. We know there will be an increased risk. We know we should be doing something about that, but we are doing nothing.", "We have a bill in front of us that could lead the way for leadership, that could send a clear message to the people of Ontario that your government is on it, that we are ready, that we are prepared, that as soon as the federal government passes their law, we will be ready. We will have a health promotion approach to this. Our youth will know about it. We will know how the distribution will be done. We will know how the taxation will be done. We will have a clear plan that everybody understands, that everybody had a chance to participate in, but I’m dealing with a Liberal government who is going to wait until the train leaves the station.", "I want to bring you back, Speaker. You remember when cellphones became the norm. Everybody has a cellphone—pretty much everyone. People started texting while they were driving—lots of accidents, lots of hardship, lots of really severe damage done to humans and vehicles. Years down the road, we passed a law that says texting and driving is illegal. It was too late. For human beings, once they get a habit, it is really, really hard to change this habit. So for all of us who, while they’re driving or sitting at a red light, have a quick peek at their cellphone just to see if the little light went from green to red—once you start doing this, to get a human being to change this behaviour is really hard.", "The law that says you can’t text and drive at the same time will be effective for the new generation because, right now, if you’re a kid taking driver’s ed, the first thing they do when you start—the first time at the wheel—is ask for your cellphone. They give you this nifty little pouch. They open up the trunk of the car and they put your cellphone in the trunk of the car. This is the first thing you learn before you go on and learn to drive. And that’s great. The new generation of drivers won’t be texting and driving because you taught them from the beginning. But for the rest of us who started to use their cellphones in the car before the law was there, very few will change.", "I’m telling you this story because the link is the same. If you look at the use of recreational cannabis—if we don’t get the regulations right before it becomes legal, it will be too late. You will not be able to go back. If you want to look at things like changing the age rather than having it line up with the age of alcohol, putting it at a different age; if you want to make some of the regulations as to where you can and cannot consume recreational marijuana—all of those have to be done ahead of time, communicated ahead of time and bought in by the people of Ontario ahead of time.", "Whenever I ask about what is coming, the only answer I get back is, “We’re waiting for the federal government to act.” In my mind and in the minds of everybody who cares about public health and in the minds of everybody who cares about making sure that people don’t go on to be smokers, we’re hearing that they’re going to miss the boat. It’s going to be too late for those hundreds of thousands of people who presently use recreational marijuana in an illegal way, who are biting at the bit to do this in a legal way. We have to talk to those people. The longer we have radio silence, the less of a chance we will have to put a healthy public policy forward.", "Why is it that I have this bill in front of me and there is nothing in this bill that will do that? It disappoints me. I expect more than this. I was really proud when Ontario was the first Legislature to have a Minister of Health Promotion. It looked like we cared about health promotion. It looked like we finally understood that if we invest in health promotion and disease prevention, not only are people healthier and better, but you also have a pretty significant impact on the health care costs down the road because people stay healthier longer and use the health care system less, because we use the health care system when we’re sick.", "We don’t have a Ministry of Health Promotion anymore. It has been amalgamated. Frankly, when we had a Ministry of Health Promotion, it was less than stellar. Here again, we have the same opportunity in front of us right now, and we’re about to miss the boat.", "There’s a slew of research as to who uses cannabis for recreational purposes. It starts in about grade 7. We have stats for students in grade 7. Those are young people between the ages of 11 and 12. We know most of them smoke because right now, to get your hands on drinkable or edible or chewable or vaporizing is not easy, so most of them only have access to the smoking form. It’s pretty high. Those are young people who, in theory, don’t have access to tobacco, don’t have access to alcohol, but they do have access.", "We have this other mega problem of all of the illegal trade coming in. Do you really think that organized crime, which brings a huge part of our drugs into this province right now, is simply going to sit back and say, “Oh, it is legal now. We will go and make money someplace else”? No, absolutely not. This has to be taken into the equation, and it doesn’t seem to be.", "I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the proactive work that a legal framework for cannabis could look like. There are benefits to legalization. You can make sure that the product that will be sold is actually what you’re buying. Right now, everybody buys their recreational marijuana on the black market. They don’t really know what they’re buying. I can guarantee you that there are no labels on it and there are no quality controls on it or anything of the sort.", "The legalization will allow us to do this. It would be good for the government of Ontario to start to ask people: What kind of labelling would you want? What kind of information would you want to see? Basically, What kind of regulatory models would you like?", "The criminalization that we have right now—we can put a big X on that. That did not work. We could have government control or what we call a government monopoly, or we could have commercialization. Of course, we have prescriptions also. Why isn’t the government forthcoming as to what exactly that will look like? You cannot have a public health approach to regulation in silos without talking to anybody. I know that there are really some good people within the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of the Attorney General. There are some good people who are working on this, but they’re talking to themselves when they should be taking a public health approach and talking to all of us.", "What will accessibility and availability look like? Where will it be sold? What kind of density of access are we talking about? Will we have any regulation in Ontario?", "The federal government is not going to look at this. This is our responsibility. Put it out there so that people can tell you what they want and so that we strike the right balance that respects our goal to have a public health approach.", "What will be the minimum age? Why aren’t we having those conversations, Speaker? There is more and more data and evidence being built all over us that says that people want this. This should be in this bill. This should be part of the Smoke-Free Ontario Act because we know that most people consume marijuana in a smoking form. We know that when we add the four words to the bill “and other prescribed substances,” what we really mean is the regulation of marijuana. But none of that is done.", "Density of sales of outlets: How many of those will we have? What will the marketing and promotion of recreational marijuana look like? Why aren’t we talking about this? Why aren’t we, as legislators, setting out the regulations that will tell you what you will and will not be allowed to do?", "There are a lot of people who have a lot of ideas about this. You can walk not far from Queen’s Park and see that marijuana is being advertised on the front of many businesses right now. Is this what we want? Is this what we should move forward? Are we going to watch Hockey Night in Canada and see who is having a sale on recreational marijuana? Some people think it’s a good idea; others, not so much.", "When you put a public health approach lens to this, you realize that it is the government’s responsibility to say what will and what won’t be, because if you don’t regulate, then people are allowed to expect and to bring forward business ventures where they will be able to take advantage of this new trade, of this new product, of this new commerce opportunity.", "But if we do not want, when we watch Hockey Night in Canada, to have the latest flavour of marijuana advertised over and over and over, then the government has to speak up. And how do we speak up? We speak up by making modifications to the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, which is in front of us right now. And what are we doing? Nothing.", "How about pricing and taxation? We all know that, especially for young people, price is a huge decision-maker for them. We all know that taxation allows you to regulate the price. It’s not going to be the federal government who tells us how much the province is going to tax this product, is it, Mr. Speaker? Why is it that we’re waiting till the federal government has finished its work before we start ours?", "Nobody is going to tell the provincial government how to tax recreational marijuana. The people in this House, the people in this chamber, are the ones who are going to decide. Hopefully, it will be done through a public health approach. Hopefully, it will be done through the Smoke-Free Ontario Act. Why aren’t we talking about that? Why do I have this bill with only four words? I want more.", "We also have to have driving measures. How are we going to do this? Are we going to follow alcohol, where it’s 0.05, and once you pass this, you have a penalty, and the penalty increases exponentially if a whole bunch of other factors come in? Are we going to follow this? Are we going to say zero tolerance right off the bat and not move from there? I can tell you that there are a lot of people who are pushing in that direction. But here again, we have an entire Liberal government that is happy with radio silence.", "One of the areas that is near and dear to my heart is health promotion and education.

We cannot wait to start educating their parents. We cannot wait to start educating all Ontarians as to what this will look like, what the health effects are, and do it in a way that is not this patronizing, “Drugs are bad. Don’t do it.” We already know that doesn’t work. There are evidence-based education campaigns and health promotion campaigns that exist that are effective and that make sure people use cannabis in a way that is respectful to their health and the health of everybody around.", "There are also additional considerations. We talk an awful lot about climate change and we talk an awful lot about zero carbon, but right now I can tell you that most of the production of cannabis in Ontario is done indoors. The indoor production of cannabis has an incredible carbon footprint. We’re talking through the roof here because they use intensive lighting and climate control. When it’s minus 40 outside, it has to be warm in there. I can give you an example. One joint represents 1.5 kilograms of carbon—for one joint. It’s the equivalent of driving a hybrid car for 35 kilometres.", "So how about right off the bat we ask that whoever will cultivate cannabis does it with carbon-free electricity generation, so that you’re bringing in a brand new product and you make it carbon free, or you force them to have 100% offset of their electricity consumption with renewable energy. This would be leadership and this would be getting ready for the tsunami that is coming. But what are we hearing from the other side?

On le sait tous. Mais ce n’est pas sans dangers, surtout pour les jeunes. On sait maintenant que la consommation du cannabis chez les jeunes qui grandissent a un effet sur le cerveau.

Dr. McDonald and a team of incredible collaborators conducted their groundbreaking research in 2000 at the world-class Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, 2,000 metres below the surface in the city of Sudbury. I had the privilege of visiting the lab a few years ago, and I can confirm that it is indeed a spectacular research centre.", "Through his discovery that the tiny particles known as neutrinos have mass, Dr. McDonald created new knowledge that has challenged what was long thought to be a fundamental truth in quantum physics. In doing so, he has joined the ranks of the titans of physics such as J.J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Enrico Fermi, Abdus Salam, and Wolfgang Pauli, who created the concept of the neutrino.", "Dr. McDonald made the discovery that the Nobel committee themselves indicated “has changed the understanding of the innermost workings of matter,” the discovery of which could “prove crucial to our view of the universe.”", "Albert Einstein once said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge since imagination embraces the entire world and all there ever will be to know and understand.”", "Our willingness to imagine, to accept that we don’t know everything, and our tireless pursuit to obtain new knowledge is fundamental to every advancement and every major discovery that modern society has known. It is through groundbreaking work like Dr. McDonald’s that we have the opportunity to so clearly see the limitless possibilities of modern science.", "We rightly focus our mind on Dr. McDonald earning the 2015 Nobel Prize in physics, the world’s premier award for major achievement in the field. But I also want to recognize that shortly after that, Dr. McDonald was honoured with his second major international award of the year, the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics.", "At that time, his mother told a story about when Dr. McDonald was a very young man growing up in Cape Breton. Even as a two-year-old, Valerie McDonald said, “He would sit and stare at the ticking clock resting on the window ledge of his childhood home.” And even then, Mrs. McDonald said, she knew that his young and inquisitive mind was trying to figure out exactly how that clock worked. And with determination, collaboration and, yes, imagination, that mind has made a major contribution to global knowledge and inspired all of us in the process.", "Dr. McDonald, on behalf of the Liberal caucus, I want to not only congratulate you but thank you. Thank you for reaffirming to the world that life-altering discoveries can and do take place in the province of Ontario, a province that prides itself on the talent and the skills of our people and on our strength in research and innovation. And thank you for showing our young people that knowledge can only be created by asking questions, by testing what is assumed to be true and by working closely with others in a truly collaborative way. Your work and the work of others like Dr. Takaaki Kajita, co-winner of the Nobel Prize for 2015 in physics, has made our understanding of the world richer. As a scientist, I know that you share these awards with the many others you have worked with over the years. To that end, I would like to thank all of you here joining Dr. McDonald in the gallery of this Legislature.", "Mr. Speaker, my fellow parliamentarians: These faces, led by Dr. McDonald, are what innovation, imagination and knowledge creation are all about. So please join me once more in congratulating Dr. McDonald and his partners for their incredible contribution to physics, to human knowledge, to Ontario and to our wonderful country, Canada.", "Thank you very much.

McDonald.", "Thank you, Dr. McDonald, for being here today with us. I would also like to welcome some of your guests: Michael Fraser, Dr. Nigel Smith, Yvonne Cooper and Anne Martineau. Welcome also to Queen’s Park.", "Dr. McDonald’s accomplishments follow a lifetime of dedicated work in physics, leading to breakthrough discoveries that have helped us and will help future generations better understand our universe.", "That dedicated work began in the classrooms and science labs of his native Sydney, Nova Scotia, where Dr. McDonald’s brilliance was evident early on. In fact, in the years after he left his mark at a North Sydney high school, students were wary of even taking a seat at his former desk due to the legacy it already held. If a student brave enough to take that seat answered a teacher’s question incorrectly, the teacher would often shake their head and say, “Do you realize ‘the’ Arthur McDonald used to sit at that desk?”", "Dr. McDonald grew that legacy through his post-secondary years in Nova Scotia, obtaining both his bachelor’s and master of science from Dalhousie University in Halifax before attending the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, to obtain a PhD in physics.", "If Pasadena seems familiar to those who believe they have a grasp of science because they’ve caught themselves watching a marathon of Big Bang Theory a time or two, you should know that the connection is not that far-fetched. In fact, there’s a very real connection that traces back to roots from Dr. McDonald’s years as a professor at Princeton University. While he is now positioned as a professor emeritus and former university research chair at Queen’s University in Kingston, it was during his time at Princeton in the 1980s that he taught a young David Saltzberg, who went on to become the Big Bang Theory’s science consultant. Fast forward a couple of decades. When David heard about the Nobel Prize win, he invited Dr. McDonald to a taping of the show. Apparently, David occasionally gets to bring a real scientist, known as “geek of the week,” to the set to meet the producers, writers and actors of the show.", "From geek of the week to Nobel Prize winner of the year in physics: both significant accomplishments to be sure, Speaker, but it’s the latter and the breakthrough discovery it speaks to that is really the “big bang” that has literally changed scientific theory forever.", "Dr. McDonald’s big bang actually came from ongoing research at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, or SNOLAB, looking at neutrinos that come from the sun. Dr. McDonald, the director of the observatory since 1989, discovered in 2001 that those neutrinos from the sun changed their identities and were not disappearing on their way to earth. Interestingly enough, this discovery led to the far-reaching conclusion that neutrinos must have mass, dispelling the long-held notion that they were massless. I know that’s what I always thought, Speaker.", "So it was Dr. McDonald’s work in the underground science laboratory, located two kilometres below the earth’s surface in the Vale Creighton Mine near Sudbury, that forever changed how we think about the solar star some millions of kilometres above the earth. As Dr. McDonald noted himself, “It’s ironic that in order to observe the sun you have to go ... kilometres underground.”", "In awarding Dr. McDonald and his co-winner, Dr. Kajita of the University of Tokyo, the Nobel Prize academy indicated, “The discovery has changed our understanding of the innermost workings of matter.”", "His discoveries have helped to inform and inspire. As Dr. McDonald’s legacy grows, he speaks about his hope for more young people and women to get into science. The example he has set should help to inspire young and aspiring scientists to know that they can accomplish great things right here in their backyard. His legacy will inspire for generations to come, just as he has inspired this generation: his students, research associates and those who know him personally.", "Dr. McDonald, on behalf of Patrick Brown and the PC caucus, we are so proud of your work here in Ontario that has transcended boundaries and shaped the way we understand our universe. We look towards the future with great pride, knowing that amazing things lie ahead for you and your dedicated team at SNOLAB, based on the discoveries you have already made.", "I personally, as one dedicated Leafs fan to another, trust your foresight in moving forward. You are clearly a brilliant decision-maker. On behalf of the Ontario Legislature, thank you for the contributions you have made to this province and to the rest of Canada. We of course look forward to seeing what comes next." ],

Since receiving his doctorate degree in physics, he has been using numerous techniques to study the fundamental laws of physics. As we’ve heard this morning, this has led him to study neutrinos.", "Neutrinos are elemental particles in physics that have one of the smallest masses of known subatomic particles. They are created either by radioactive decay, by the sun, by nuclear reactors, supernova etc., but they are really hard to detect. In 1989, Dr. McDonald became the overall director of a project trying to detect neutrinos from the sun.", "The neutrinos are extremely difficult to observe due in part to background radiation. What he decided to do was to study those tiny particles—and when I say tiny, Speaker, look at the top of my thumb. Right here, right now, there are a million neutrinos going through that little bit of space. They’re tiny.", "So Dr. McDonald built a detector. The detector is the size of a 10-storey building. It has detectors within it all over, and it is filled with millions of dollars’ worth of heavy water. But he had to do this two kilometres under the ground in Creighton Mine, in an environment that is about a thousand times cleaner than the cleanest operating room in one of our hospitals—not an easy feat for him, for his team or, I would say, for a few cage operators and hoist men who had to bring all of this equipment down two kilometres to the site.", "It took almost a decade to build it—that was in the 1990s—and then in the year 2000, the experiment started.", "By the time of its opening, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory was the lowest-radioactivity location that had been created on Earth. The SNOLAB continues to be a world-class facility and continues to focus on subatomic physics, largely neutrino and dark matter physics. It is a source of pride for all of us.", "I had the opportunity to visit the SNOLAB and—get this, Speaker—I had my picture taken with a supernova detector and a dark matter camera. Let me tell you, at the time, the theme song for The Big Bang Theory was playing in the back of my mind. I thought I was pretty cool.", "While the study was taking place, there were many postgraduate PhD students with Dr. McDonald, as well as his second-in-command, Dr. Doug Hallman, professor emeritus in physics at Laurentian University. All those smart people would gather at Eddie’s. Eddie’s is a sports bar that had this online trivia. So all of those great minds would go online and play this science trivia with the world. You will be happy to know that they were the champions every single time. We now have a plaque in Eddie’s Sports Bar that shows that they are the winners, and I’m happy to report that scientists from 63 different countries speaking 40 different languages have come to Eddie’s Sports Bar to see the feat that was done by those good people.", "Dr. McDonald is also a very humble man. After winning his physics Nobel Prize, he came back to Sudbury and went to Science North, our science centre in Sudbury. At the time, there was a group of high school students visiting. He gave them, I would say, a one-hour lecture as to what neutrinos are, and what changing-flavour neutrinos are all about. All of those kids understood, because he has a way to make things clear and understandable, even for people like me.", "He was also wearing his Nobel Prize medal at the time. I’m putting it out there that he agrees to take selfies—just so that people know. This is a pretty incredible medal. If you ever see one of those, it will impress you. I can guarantee it.", "Science North has also created an amazing exhibit that focuses on the work he has done and what it’s all about. The exhibit will open at Canada House in London, England, on Canada Day at the end of this month, and then it will come back to Canada and tour all the museums and universities so that, young and old, we can all learn about the incredible accomplishment of this man, his work and the work of the SNOLAB.", "I will leave you with an anecdote from Art. After waking up one morning, he asked his wife, “Did I really win the Nobel Prize for physics?” Yes, Dr. McDonald, you did. You are our hero and you will always be welcomed back to Nickel Belt. Thank you." ],

According to the member, the release of this plan to the media before its announcement or tabling in the House amounted to contempt of the House. The member from Timmins–James Bay, Monsieur Bisson, and the government House leader, Mr. Naqvi, also spoke to this matter. Having reviewed the relevant media references, the precedents, the authorities, the Hansard for June 7 and the written submissions of the member from Simcoe–Grey and the government House leader, I am now prepared to rule on the matter.", "The member from Simcoe–Grey referenced section 7(6) of the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016, which provides as follows: “The minister shall, before January 1, 2017, lay the action plan before the assembly and make it available to the public on a website of the government or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the regulations.” According to the member, this provision required the plan to be tabled in the House before the media received it. The government House leader had a different interpretation of that provision. In response, I have to say that I cannot rule on the interpretation of that provision because, as members well know, Speakers traditionally avoid interpreting laws.", "The member from Simcoe–Grey also cited rulings by Speakers of the Canadian House of Commons. The rulings relate to the premature disclosure of the contents of bills prior to their introduction in the House. In the rulings, the Speaker ruled that the premature disclosure of the contents of “bills on notice” amounted to a prima facie case. The reference to the words “on notice” is important because the standing orders of the House of Commons require 48 hours’ notice before bills can be introduced in the House. Such bills are House business. Under our standing orders, however, neither bills nor policy announcements are placed on notice. Therefore, the cited rules are not applicable to the case at hand and as a result I am unable to find that a prima facie case of contempt has been established.", "In so ruling, however, I want to remind members that from time to time previous Speakers have expressed misgivings about new government initiatives being announced outside the House before being announced inside the House. As I indicated in this House on April 14, 2014:", "“Whether it be the government’s financial plan, or any other measure or announcement, Speakers have repeatedly looked unfavourably upon it when the House has not been the first to receive such information. There are rulings almost too numerous to compile in which Speakers have admonished governments for doing this, and defending the Legislature’s claim to be the first recipient of major announcements.”", "And in a November 2, 2009 ruling, the Speaker ruled as follows:", "“I and my predecessors have repeatedly conveyed our deep concern about how these types of extra-parliamentary announcements erode the stature of Parliament. Speakers have repeatedly implored governments to consider the impact of this erosion and how it damages the reputation of the foundation institution of this province.... In an ideal world where the legitimate and historic role of the Legislative Assembly, and specifically of the loyal opposition, were given first consideration, I expect that what a previous Speaker referred to as these types of ‘administrative discourtesies’ would not arise.”", "The incident raised by the member from Simcoe–Grey is different in that it deals with the media—not the government—announcing a government initiative, but the reality is that the media somehow acquired the information. In the case at hand, I have no personal knowledge that the government released details of the initiative to the media, but I would have more than misgivings if such releases were motivated by a patently obvious desire to undermine parliamentary processes.", "In closing, I thank the member from Simcoe–Grey, the member from Timmins–James Bay and the government House leader for their submissions.", "Deferred vote on the motion for third reading of the following bill:", "Bill 178, An Act to amend the Smoke-Free Ontario Act / Projet de loi 178, Loi modifiant la Loi favorisant un Ontario sans fumée." ],

In doing so, I want to recognize a number of colleagues, friends and family who have come to Queen’s Park today in support of today’s debate. They are my brother, Ed McMahon; Constable Hugh Smith from the Toronto Police Service; from the Ontario Provincial Police Association, Chris Hoffman; from the Police Association of Ontario, Stephen Reid and Bruce Chapman; Jamie Stuckless, executive director of the Share the Road Cycling Coalition, and Share the Road board member Ian Brisbin, a lawyer from Hamilton. Thank you all for being here.", "Ten years ago this week, my life and the lives of many people dear to me changed forever when a careless driver struck and killed my husband, OPP Sergeant Greg Stobbart, a veteran police officer in his 25th year of service. Greg was killed while on a training ride in Milton. He was 44 years old and in the prime of his life.", "As many of my honourable colleagues in this House know, Greg’s death and his life’s work as an OPP officer have been the impetus for the direction I’ve taken in my life over the past decade. It has shaped my approach to and my decisions regarding advocacy, and my decision to fight for changes to legislative constructs, enhanced infrastructure funding, and education and awareness for motorists and cyclists when it comes to sharing the road, all in the interest of road safety.", "Our response to this tragic loss was, in 2008, making the case for legislative changes that would enhance road safety by providing front-line law enforcement with the tools they needed to reduce the number of motorists who continue to drive under suspension. This was in response to Greg’s case but also to the estimated half-million suspended drivers in Ontario, with an estimated three quarters of these people continuing to drive despite their suspension. Greg’s Law provided for enhanced penalties for motorists who drive under suspension, in the hopes of reducing repeat offenders and in the hopes of reducing the number of uninsured drivers and getting them off the road. It passed in 2009 and came into force in 2010.", "In 2008, we started the Share the Road Cycling Coalition, a provincial cycling advocacy organization with a mandate to bring about legislative change in Ontario that would enhance road safety, empower municipalities to make their communities more bicycle-friendly, change the conversation, and enhance education and awareness of the importance of sharing the road, reminding people that whether you’re a driver, a cyclist or a pedestrian, we all have responsibilities when we’re on the road.", "During my time at the coalition, I’m proud to say that, working together with many members of this House, we made tremendous progress for cyclists, and indeed all vulnerable road users. This progress included the first provincial infrastructure program for cycling, with $25 million in dedicated funding for projects that are now being built in communities across Ontario. We drove major changes to the Highway Traffic Act, including a one-metre safe passing law, the second in Canada, as part of the most significant update to the Highway Traffic Act for cycling in our province’s history, Bill 31, in 2015. A provincial investment in cycling education programs was another major and very recent step forward. All of these were recommendations of the 2012 Ontario coroner’s review into cycling deaths—and I was honoured to sit as a member of that review. All of this is Greg’s legacy.", "While I’m tremendously proud of what has been accomplished, at the end of the day, like all of the 129 cyclists who were part of the coroner’s death review, like the hundreds of Ontarians who die on our roads each year, Greg’s death was preventable.", "The driver who killed Greg had five previous convictions of driving with a suspended licence, two convictions of driving with no insurance, and had collected $15,000 in traffic-related fines. His sentence: His licence was suspended again, and he received 100 hours of community service. And just 62 days after this man hit Greg, he hit someone else. One of the conclusions to be drawn from this is that, despite his actions, despite the fact that he killed someone as a result of his carelessness, he continued to drive without the kind of due care and attention which is the minimum standard expected of all of us and which the careless driving statute, section 130 of the Highway Traffic Act, which I hope to amend today, demands.", "Tragically, Greg’s story is not unique. Every year in Ontario, lives are taken because another individual made a bad choice. In 2015, in the city of Toronto alone, 64 people died in traffic fatalities—this is up from 35 in 2011 and 51 in 2014, so in six years the number of lives lost, all of them preventable, has nearly doubled—and of those, 38 were pedestrians and four were cyclists, meaning that 67% of those were vulnerable road users. I’m willing to bet, although statistics are not kept in this regard, that a good chunk of those led to charges of careless driving and to outcomes for all concerned—the victims, their families, the police officers laying the charge—that were less than satisfactory from the perspective of some kind of assurance that the penalties associated with the outcomes were sufficient.", "Of course, when you lose someone you love, like I did, nothing is going to bring them back and nothing will feel sufficient. But of this I am sure: The current statute, which lacks specificity both in terms of the charge and the sentence provisions, is calling out for reform.", "Carelessness is the cause of most deaths that result from vehicle-related accidents. By the year 2020, it is estimated that road traffic injuries will become the third-greatest contributor to the global burden of disease and injury. These kinds of injuries and fatalities are preventable. In fact, according to the 2012 coroner’s report that I mentioned earlier, of the 129 deaths reviewed, 100% of them were preventable, because all drivers make choices, whether it’s choosing to text and drive, choosing to get behind the wheel after a few beers or, instead, choosing to concentrate on the task at hand, focusing on the road and arriving at their destination safely.", "A police officer friend of mine once said, “Sometimes they’re just accidents, Eleanor.” Fair enough. But if your poor choice results in injury or the death of another human being, if you are inattentive behind the wheel even for a moment, if your carelessness and disregard for others leads to these results, if Bill 213 passes, the penalties you will pay are significant. By contrast, the person who is the victim of your carelessness, who may be seriously injured, will face a life of difficult challenges, and so will their family. And if you kill them, then the sentence that you will have imposed is a life sentence, as I know only too well.", "As police officers know, it’s unlikely that these types of collisions, including those causing death, will result in criminal charges and the stiffer penalties that come with federal statutes. Indeed, most will result in a traffic violation under the Highway Traffic Act. It’s far too common for drivers who have caused the death of another human being to see penalties as simple as a fine of a few hundred dollars, demerit points or a suspended driver’s licence. Worse still, as happens so often with traffic offences, a plea bargaining process ensues, with a lesser sentence often applied. If we provide officers with the tools they need to lay a charge that speaks to the behaviour of the motorist as well as the outcome, and if we provide the courts with greater specificity when it comes to sentencing options, with the full force of the highest penalties allowed under provincial statute, then we are sending a clear signal to all Ontarians that driving is a privilege and not a right, that driving carelessly is serious, and that lives matter, especially when the family of the victim serves a life sentence of grief.", "For repeat offenders, the current penalties run the risk of continuing to have little deterrent effect. I’ve seen that first-hand.", "Under the Highway Traffic Act, careless driving is one of the most serious offences. It is defined as driving without due care and attention. In order to charge a driver under the Criminal Code, there would need to be established an intent to kill or cause bodily harm, or the driver in question would have had to be so outrageously dangerous that the driver would have known that killing someone was a likely outcome.", "Our legal system requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict someone of a criminal charge, and for good reason. It’s an important pillar of our justice system. But in cases of careless driving that cause death, unfortunately that means that most of these drivers are charged under the Highway Traffic Act, where the driver’s actions are under scrutiny, not the fact that an innocent person was seriously injured or killed.", "Personal injury lawyer Patrick Brown, a colleague with whom I called for a review of cycling deaths by the Ontario coroner and with whom I served on that review, recently noted that of the cases studied in the review, charges were laid in only 30% of the cases, with 19% of them under the Highway Traffic Act and 11% under the Criminal Code. I’m not advocating that all motorists should be charged and penalized as criminals, but I do believe that we need to encourage safe driving and deter careless driving so that preventable deaths are just that—prevented.", "There’s clearly a gap between careless driving and the criminal offence of dangerous driving or criminal negligence. Bill 213 seeks to close that gap. Currently, under the Highway Traffic Act, the minimum fine for careless driving is $400 and the maximum is $2,000. Drivers could face up to six demerit points, a licence suspension of up to two years, and up to six months in prison, although this is rarely, if ever, delivered as a sentence.", "Indeed, a friend of mine, a member of the Toronto Police Service with 29 years of service, told me recently that in all his years on the job, most of them in traffic, with all of the careless driving charges he has laid, none of them has resulted in a jail sentence, despite the fact that people have died as a result of the carelessness of a motorist.", "To him and to all the officers across Ontario who serve our province, who work so diligently to keep our roads safe every day, I say this: In Greg’s memory and in memory of all those whose lives have been lost, for all the accident and collision reconstructionists, the guys and gals patrolling our roads and provincial highways, today’s bill is for you.", "Greg’s frustration with the lack of specificity inherent in section 130 and his frustration at his inability to lay a charge which fit the offence was something I heard about very often.", "Today, we are changing the conversation about what careless driving should mean. This bill aims to fill the gap between less and more severe offences, providing additional charging options to both law enforcement and our courts. It aims to recognize and provide a tool for collisions that result in serious injury or death by creating a separate offence of careless driving causing death or bodily harm. Bill 213, if passed, would increase penalties under this new category, making a clear distinction between careless driving and careless driving causing death or bodily harm. It will also give police officers more time to conduct an investigation, and collision reconstructionists the time they need to do these often painstaking investigations.", "Under the proposed new category, fines would be a minimum of $2,000 to a maximum of $50,000. The driver could face a maximum of two years in prison, the maximum allowed under provincial statute, as opposed to the current maximum for careless driving, which is six months. Their driver’s licence could be suspended for up to five years. Their sentencing options will include the requirement to complete a road safety or driver training course, as well.", "Ultimately, the goal is to have penalties in place that discourage careless driving and encourage good choices behind the wheel. But we will also use this opportunity to help promote public awareness of the threat posed by motor vehicles in the hands of the wrong person. And finally, we will draw attention to the fact that when a motorist is careless and hits a cyclist or a pedestrian, the outcomes are much more significant.", "With Bill 213, both our officers and our courts will have the opportunity to send that very clear signal that driving with due care and attention matters, arguably more so when it comes to our most vulnerable road users.", "In closing, I want to thank all of my colleagues on all sides of the House for their support for road safety, for community safety, and, most of all, for their support for cycling and all of our combined efforts to make sharing the road easier and safer for all Ontarians.", "To my family, to my policing family, it is my privilege to table this law on your behalf.", "And to Greg, wherever you are, I hope the skies are blue, the road ahead is clear, and that you are pedalling with all of the joy, the enthusiasm and the love of life that was so emblematic to everything that you were and that you meant to all of us. Ride on in the knowledge that we are working hard to make the roads safer in your name." ],

It’s not too often that we have an opportunity in this House to work through continued distractions, share common ground and bring all sides together for a common goal.", "I think we can all agree there is no doubt that we, as legislators, need to address new and emerging safety concerns on our roadways, as this bill proposes, much as we need to address those who cause safety concerns for those around them due to carelessness. The truth is that there are shared goals among all of us here for the protection of public safety for Ontarians using our roads, whether they are on two wheels, four or more. As such, I feel that the Highway Traffic Amendment Act (Careless Driving) offers one of these rare opportunities to encapsulate the work of government, opposition and our diligent safety partners in the effort to protect motorists, pedestrians and cyclists alike as we address carelessness on our roads.", "We’ve heard the government member’s proposal to amend the Highway Traffic Act to increase the penalties for careless driving causing death or bodily harm. An offender, once convicted, would be liable to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $50,000. There are also imprisonment increases to a term of not more than two years. If those do not work as enough of a deterrent to reckless behaviour on our roads, the bill also proposes that the offender may have their licence suspended for not more than five years, may be ordered to complete a road safety or driver training course, and the limitation period in respect of careless driving causing death or bodily harm will be increased to two years.", "Although I mentioned this bill acting as a deterrent to reckless behaviour—which I’m sure we all hope it will, if passed—it will also allow those in law enforcement to be able to see justice handed out for crimes, instead of seeing offenders simply walking away unscathed, oftentimes with their licence in tow, because the penalties, as they currently stand, do not include imprisonment or the loss of a licence. Under the Highway Traffic Act, this sort of infraction, even if it causes a loss of life, carries a maximum penalty of just $500.", "Unfortunately, the member opposite knows this tragedy far too intimately, as she has shared so passionately with us today. MPP McMahon lost her husband, OPP Sergeant Greg Stobbart, as the result of the recklessness of a man who had five convictions for driving while under licence suspension, four convictions for driving with no insurance and $15,000 in unpaid fines; two months later, he was involved in another at-fault collision—all of this while driving commercially. This man only received 100 hours of community service as a penalty, whereas the MPP from Burlington is facing a life sentence without her partner. This, quite frankly, is a shortfall of our own justice system.", "This type of story is something we hear far too often. In my region, a young woman was convicted of dangerous driving causing bodily harm for suddenly veering across several lanes of the Conestoga Parkway in a doomed bid to make her exit. She had been speeding and aggressively passing other vehicles as she approached the off-ramp. The reckless manoeuvre by the young woman on the afternoon of August 31, 2012, caused a devastating three-car crash that sent seven people to hospital, including Robert Jacques, 46, who spent six weeks in a coma and suffered life-changing injuries after her car landed on his roof, off the flyover ramp on southbound Highway 8.", "The judge sentenced her to six months for causing the car crash and imposed a 10-year driving prohibition, the maximum allowed, based upon her driving history and her behaviour on the road that day.", "Although we hear these stories far too often, we do not often hear of convictions for dangerous driving. As those in law enforcement know, it is quite difficult to convict, as you have to prove either intent or recklessness.", "Because of this, I commend the member from Burlington for being creative within the legislative tools we are afforded in this province to create stricter penalties for those who far too often slip through the cracks and loopholes in the justice system, and for sharing her heartbreaking story with us today in the hope that history does not repeat itself and we can continue to protect the lives of those on our roads.", "Thank you for your time today, Speaker." ],

I’m committed to ensuring that the roads in this province are safe and the regulations are fair across the board.", "The bill we have before us today, Bill 213, An Act to amend the Highway Traffic Act with respect to careless driving causing death or bodily harm, is an important one. It’s important because it helps to protect the most vulnerable members of our society who use our roads and because it helps ensure that in cases of careless driving that cause death or serious injury, the punishment will fit the crime. Those are two courses of action that are important for us to take.", "Vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, users of mobility devices and even motorcyclists face the highest risk of death or serious injury on our roads. A collision between a car and a cyclist or a pedestrian is vastly more likely to result in serious injury or death to the cyclist or pedestrian than a collision between cars.", "Far too often when collisions occur between a car and a vulnerable road user, the punishment for the driver of that car does not fit the crime. This has led to groups such as Cycle Toronto, the Bikers Rights Organization and the United Senior Citizens of Ontario to call for stricter penalties when a collision occurs between a car and a road user leading to death or serious injury, and I stand with them in this call.", "The Ontario NDP understands the need to protect vulnerable road users, and we support efforts to do that. Unfortunately, the bill we have before us today falls short of the standards set in the calls by the organizations I have mentioned.", "One of the main changes that these organizations call for is that motorists who cause injury or death should be required to attend court at the time of sentencing and hear victim statements. The simple fact that someone who causes injury or death doesn’t even have to go to court when they have their sentencing to hear from those whom they impacted is, quite frankly, I believe, ridiculous. This needs to change.", "The other area where this bill falls short is one that left me very confused. This bill would only mandate harsher punishment for those who cause death or serious injury as a result of careless driving. That means that in the 2011 case of a driver who made an illegal left turn and killed a pedestrian in Brampton, they would still only face the $500 fine that was levied against him at the time. That means that in the 2002 case that I spoke of before, Wanda and David Harrison, who were killed while out riding their motorcycle by a driver making an illegal left turn, the driver again would only face the $500 fine that was levied against him at that time. That simply is not right. Again, I’ve raised this. The families and friends of the Harrisons and of the Brampton pedestrian will tell you it wasn’t right then, and if we’re going to change the law, we need to get it right now.", "Here is where my confusion came in. Back in December of last year, I introduced a private member’s bill to this House called Bill 154, An Act to amend the Highway Traffic Act to create an offence of contravention causing death or serious bodily harm. The bill passed second reading unanimously and it has sat waiting to be heard at committee ever since.", "Bill 154 would have added a new section to the Highway Traffic Act that created an offence related to collisions causing death or serious injury. It would have ensured that any driver who causes death or serious injury, whether careless driving was involved or not, would face a punishment more consistent with the crime.", "There are some differences between my bill and the one we see before us today. The truth is, those differences are small. Clearly, the member from Burlington—my colleague—and I have the same goals in mind. I would have been happy to work with her and with her government to amend the bill. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen. I feel absolutely terrible about what happened to her husband, who was killed.", "I’m going to tell a story, because I think it’s important to tell stories like this—the one about the one that survives and what that does to their family and what that does to their kids.", "One day, a woman was coming down Lundy’s Lane. A vice-principal, early forties. A car pulls out and crosses the line and hits that woman head-on. It didn’t kill her, but her injuries were to her shoulder, her ribs, her femur—her foot was a club foot.", "That was 12 years ago. That woman used to play volleyball, used to go on walks, she used to ride her bike. She used to go for a walk with her daughter or her husband. The drunk driver who hit her had a minor knee injury, although he cried like a little baby when it happened. He’s up and about, got on with his life.", "The woman I’m talking about can no longer play volleyball, can no longer play slo-pitch, can no longer go for long walks with her daughter or her husband, and every step she takes today hurts. But even from that accident, that strong woman that she was, she made sure she got back up on her feet, even though she was in pain every day, and was able to go from being a vice-principal to a principal, even though every step she took in that school hurt.", "When we talk about these types of bills, I think collectively we want the same thing. I believe my friends and my colleagues the Conservatives want the same thing: We want to get the bill right. We don’t want to have it where somebody can drive without a licence for four or five times, or be charged with impaired driving two or three times, and get off with a three-month sentence, in most cases a suspended sentence. We don’t want that. I don’t think anybody here wants that. We want to make sure we get the bill right and, just like you—you want to get it for your husband—to make sure that no husband or wife gets killed on our highways by somebody driving carelessly or somebody driving drunk.", "I’m going to tell you, my colleague from Burlington—because I can’t say her name—I want the same thing, because that woman that got up off that car that afternoon at 5 o’clock, where her teachers and her colleagues at the other school had to take care of her daughter, and they had to call her husband, who was in bargaining, that woman was my wife, the strongest and the smartest woman I know.", "But if we’re going to make bills like this to make changes, we have to make those changes so that person knows that if they do this, there’s going to be a crime—they’re going to pay the punishment—and to send a message to other people that it isn’t right to drive carelessly, it isn’t right to drive drunk, and it certainly isn’t right to drive drunk at 5 o’clock in the afternoon.", "I know I took a little bit of my colleague’s time, but I support your bill. I think we can do a little better. I think we should talk about it and find out how we get this bill right for your husband, for my wife and for all the other residents of the province of Ontario.

Constituents in my riding truly embrace cycling as an essential part of Toronto’s sustainable transportation network and are proud that the needs of people who cycle are now taken into account in infrastructure.

As more bicycles share the road, the potential likelihood for fatalities and serious injury related to collisions between cyclists and automobiles may also rise.", "Many municipalities across Ontario recognize that multiple modes of transportation are accepted on roads, but through the proposed amendments, all drivers in Ontario will have to be aware of all those using the road.", "In 2013, there were a total of 63 traffic fatalities resulting from collisions between cyclists and automobiles. This was an increase of 43% over 2012. Pedestrians and cyclists have continued to be killed or seriously injured on the roads in Ontario and, sadly, in my own riding of Davenport.", "Carelessness is the primary cause of most collisions between cyclists, pedestrians and vehicles. Studies show that, by the year 2020, it is estimated that road traffic injuries will become the third-largest contributor to the global burden of disease and injury. But unlike any disease, these kinds of injuries and fatalities are preventable. We all know that if you choose to drive drunk or to text and drive, it is very dangerous, and that injuries and fatalities caused by careless driving or bad choices are preventable.", "As you know, Speaker, our government is committed to making multi-modal transportation safer in Ontario, and it is our duty as a government to ensure that all Ontarians who travel on our roads are safe. These amendments will address this by using the law to help promote the need for public awareness.", "While we all have a responsibility to share the road, these amendments are important as they will implicitly give motorists more responsibility in collisions, as they can cause much more harm and damage if colliding with a cyclist or other means of transportation. Specifically, the proposed amendments will fill the penalty gap between careless driving and criminal negligence to provide more options for prosecutors to charge those who get into collisions that result in serious injury or death as a result of careless driving. This will mean that drivers will be held to a higher standard of care when operating a vehicle in a multi-modal environment. Most importantly for my community in Davenport, the amendments will provide an opportunity to table further legislation and draw attention to cyclist and pedestrian fatalities. It is time to further emphasize the responsibility of motorists to drive with due care and attention, because careless driving can have a more significant result in these cases, as cyclists and pedestrians are vulnerable road users.", "As I’ve already stated, strengthening protections for cyclists while enhancing the ability for prosecutors to charge careless drivers who cause serious injury or death are part of this government’s plan to make Ontario’s roads safer.", "Once passed, I will be pleased to bring this legislation, aimed at protecting vulnerable road users, to Davenport, as my constituents and all Ontarians deserve to be better protected when using the road.", "We can all look towards a year when bicycles, pedestrians and vehicles share the road. This legislation is a true step towards this goal, and one that I fully support." ],

Motor vehicles are effectively deadly weapons, and unless we can find the means to truly relate the penalties for driving offences to the crimes themselves, then we’re not doing an effective job.", "We now have taken a better approach in penalizing drivers for distracted driving offences and driving while under suspension. I think we should also do a better job of bringing the penalties for careless driving to the point where they truly do act as a deterrent. The penalty has to match the crime.", "All of us have to understand that if, as a result of carelessness, an accident results and a life is lost, then there will be serious consequences. If we choose to eat while driving, drink hot coffee, use mobile devices or are tuning the radio while not looking at the roadway, the penalty may be vastly more than simply those that result from distracted driving.", "Distraction that leads to an accident attributable to the careless operation of a vehicle may now, under the proposed legislation, bring with it a much larger hammer. Under the proposed legislation, a person convicted of careless driving causing death would be liable to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $50,000 and he or she could be imprisoned for a term of not more than two years and have their licence suspended for up to five years. Currently, the penalties do not include imprisonment or the loss of a licence.", "Under the Highway Traffic Act, this type of infraction, even if it causes the loss of a life, carries a current maximum penalty of $500.", "Madam Speaker, driving is a privilege, not a right. Hopefully, this legislation will be a powerful deterrent to ensure safety for everyone on the road. I look forward to supporting it." ],

Maybe I’m just getting older, Madam Speaker, but there seems to be less and less courtesy being shown on Ontario’s roads, more and more careless driving, and in fact, in spite of all of the work that governments, police forces and groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving have done, we continue to see a sharp increase in the number of impaired drivers and drivers who are climbing behind the wheel when they’re drunk. I know we’re not addressing that here, but what we are addressing through this bill—and it’s a great bill—once again is reminding drivers that carelessness is the root that kills most people in vehicle-related accidents.", "I applaud and hope that this bill brings about some change, that it defines the difference between less and more severe offences, because careless driving seems to be, in my mind, in my layperson’s mind, such a catch-all for so many things. I am pleased to see that it would set careless driving causing death at a maximum of $50,000, up from $2,000; that imprisonment could be as long as two years; that a licence suspension would be as long as five years. I think this just might get people’s attention.", "That brings me to the point that, yes, it is important to increase fines and make the differentiation between less and more severe, but I think what this bill will really do is get people talking and get our attention as drivers. All of us need that every now and then, to be reminded of the privilege that it is to drive. For that reason alone, the conversation that this will spark, the reminder that it will make, I wholeheartedly look forward to voting in favour of this bill.", "I’ll leave it there, Madam Speaker.

They want to ensure that the fine—what they’re asking with this bill—is a minimum of $2,000 and a $50,000 maximum fine.", "We want to have this come to committee, to have the real discussion with the stakeholders in how to really get the message out. I think it has to be more than fines. We really need to educate people. Cars are getting more and more toys, more apps. They’re getting cars now with WiFi. These are all adding to distracted driving.", "We’re also seeing more electric cars. I don’t believe anybody has brought this up, but electric cars are very quiet and sneak up on people, including not just pedestrians but other drivers, and, as we heard previously, motorcycles and cyclists. That’s something that concerns me. I like the fact that electric cars are quiet, and I have to say that many of us have had times where we’ve had a motorcycle weaving in and out, and the only reason we knew it was there was because of the noise it made.", "I’m also concerned that when we have collisions on our roads, there are secondary and tertiary accidents as a result because people are rubbernecking, looking at accidents in the other direction. It’s very important to me that we find a way to address the lack of productivity, yes, but also the danger of our highways being blocked.", "I want to remind everybody that my bill had overwhelming support at committee, Bill 181, Reducing Gridlock and Improving Traffic Flow Act, and it hasn’t been brought forward for third reading in the House. I would ask my colleagues on all sides of the floor to please work with me to get a better response to clearing our roads, our highways, of accidents. I think that’s one of the issues.", "I want to also mention that June 6 is a sad anniversary for my colleague from Burlington. That was just a few days ago this week, and I’m sure that’s a hard day for her. I know she was working that day. That was the day her husband, former OPP Sergeant Greg Stobbart, lost his life by a careless driver, and the this wasn’t just any careless driver. This was somebody who was driving commercially yet had five convictions for driving under suspension, four for driving with no insurance and $15,000 in unpaid fines, and even after this horrific fatal accident, he was on the roads again driving. I think that technology is wonderful, but it does add to careless driving. Maybe there is technology that can be used so we can ensure that people who just don’t care—they have no thought, no regard for anybody but themselves—somehow we can track where they’re working and whether or not they are driving. That’s going to be a very tough one to address, because of privacy rules.", "I just want to mention that my dad is a really avid cyclist. His name is Alex. When I visit him in Florida—he refuses to have a car down there—we do everything by bike. Until you’re actually trying to run errands on a bike and not just sticking to bike paths, it’s a very different experience. I’m more of a “put the bike on the back of the car”—our colleague from Parry Sound–Muskoka had a recent bill about allowing bike racks to block licence plates.

In order to ensure that Ontarians are getting that message, I was very proud to support Bill 31, the Making Ontario’s Roads Safer Act, go through the Legislature and pass on June 2, 2015. In it, we started to tackle distracted driving, an area where more and more accidents are being caused. It is indeed starting to cause more deaths and destruction on our highways than alcohol or impaired driving offences. This is one thing that I am very proud we have passed. We’ve also passed a law to ensure that there is a one-metre safe passing rule for cyclists. We have ensured that dooring carries bigger fines for hitting cyclists.", "I also wanted to point out that in the Safer Roads for a Safer Ontario Act, 2007, we had passed a law against stunt driving and street racing.

One day, a woman—she is a member of my seniors’ advisory group—had a knock at the door. She opened the door, and there was a man in an orange jacket. She looked out beyond him onto the street, and she could see other people in orange jackets knocking at the doors of some of her neighbours.", "The gentleman said that he was with the energy company and that data showed that energy use was too high in the neighbourhood, and he needed to inspect her furnace because the furnace could be out of compliance. He asked to inspect her furnace; she of course complied. He inspected the furnace and said it was out of compliance, but he had a solution for her. He said that if she paid $129 a month right away and signed on the dotted line right there, he could get the furnace replaced very, very quickly and that, as it so happened, the government of Ontario was offering a rebate of $1,300 for anyone who signed right away to get a new furnace. She agreed to this.", "Afterwards, she realized that her previous furnace actually worked just fine and that she shouldn’t have signed this contract. So the day after, she called the company, as she’s allowed to do under law, under the cooling-off period, and asked to cancel the contract. As she was on the phone trying to cancel, they wouldn’t allow her to cancel, and the installers came to install the new furnace. They took her perfectly fine furnace away and they replaced it with a new one, and she started getting billed $129 a month. She never got the rebate, of course. Even though she was told that she would be able to save on her energy bill so much to make up for the $129, that of course never happened.", "When she complained and complained and complained, the company eventually said to her, “Well, we could give you a deal. You could buy the furnace we just installed for $9,000.” The furnace that replaced a furnace that was perfectly fine and worked fine, she could pay $9,000 for to keep. That was the deal the company offered her.", "This is all too common. This is just one example of the stories I’ve heard and I know other members have heard.", "I decided that I had to do something to end this predatory practice, so in March I started to consult with constituents and with organizations like those represented here. I started to look at the root causes of the problem, and what I learned is that Ontarians continue to receive unwanted marketers at their door who use misleading, aggressive and high-pressure sales tactics to entice people into bad contracts that take advantage of consumers. Under the guise of saving consumers money, many dishonest marketers dupe consumers into contracts that are more expensive than they should be, have harsh cancellation fees or provide inferior products and services that don’t work at all, or certainly don’t work as advertised.", "The problem is particularly concentrated in the sale and lease of air conditioners, water heaters, furnaces and water treatment devices. These four products alone cost consumers who reported their experiences to the government of Ontario $3.2 million in 2015. Those are only the people who raised their concerns with the government; the vast majority of people don’t. So we can imagine that people are being duped out of millions and millions of dollars every single year across our province.", "A good portion of those talked about misrepresentation. Others brought up issues such as partial or incomplete delivery of goods and services, billing disputes, difficulty in cancelling contracts—like the story I just told you. These are just examples of the challenges people have faced across Ontario.", "While this is an issue that touches people of all ages and all backgrounds, it’s alarming to me to see how often door-to-door salespeople who use these tactics target people who are the most vulnerable. Seniors are misled. Those with serious health issues are taken advantage of. I had somebody at the press conference, when I introduced this bill, talk about her mother, who has Alzheimer’s, who was duped into a contract, and the company refused to cancel and continued to charge her. Many others are locked into contracts with no way out.", "To me, it is beyond reprehensible that there are people, organizations and businesses out there who make a living and who have a business model based on taking advantage of the most vulnerable people in our society. It has to stop, and that is why I introduced Bill 193. If passed, the bill would ban the sale, lease or rental of air conditioners, water heaters, furnaces and water treatment devices at a person’s home. It would also allow the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services to add products to this list if necessary.", "I selected these products very carefully and very deliberately because these are the ones that have been prone to those aggressive, misleading and coercive tactics that I was talking about and the ones we’ve received the most complaints about.", "If a contract is signed, under this bill what would happen is that it would be immediately void. But it was important to me that there be real consequences for those who don’t comply, for companies that continue to try to sell people these products. I believe that we need to send a strong message that this practice is unacceptable and needs to stop. Stiff penalties would be put in place for offenders who violate this ban, who violate the bill. Individual salespeople who violate the ban could be fined up to $2,000, for instance, and organizations caught breaking the ban would be subject to harsh penalties of up to $25,000. Again, we need to dissuade companies from pursuing these misleading and coercive practices.", "In addition to the contract being voided, the consumer would be entitled to any money paid under the contract as well as the return or replacement of any product taken under the contract, so the consumer would not be out of pocket.", "Finally, if the company refused to abide by all of these requirements—did not pay the consumer back their money and did not replace the product that was working—the consumer would have the option to take the company to court and, if successful—if the judge ruled in the consumer’s favour—they would be entitled to receive double the amount owed plus legal fees. Too many companies are too eager to allow the consumer to go to court with them because they have the means to take them to court, and consumers are reluctant to do so. The goal here is to dissuade offending companies from doing just that.", "I also think it’s important to strike the right balance. I come from a business background. We want to protect Ontarians from coercive sales tactics, but we also want to ensure consumers have choice, that small businesses are still able to thrive and that we, of course, do not limit the activities of charities or not-for-profit organizations.", "Let me be very clear: This does not impede charities; it does not impede community groups; it doesn’t impede people like the Girl Guides, who come and sell cookies at your door, or the local boy or girl who wants to deliver the paper to your door. We’re talking about only four product categories where we know there are consistently coercive practices being used. This bill, to me, strikes the right balance.", "I’m pleased to note that I’ve received support from all corners of the province. First of all, I have to tell you that when we introduced the bill, my constituency office got hundreds of calls from ridings across this province. I bet I got a call from every riding across Ontario in my constituency office.", "I’m also pleased that I had the support of a number of key groups, including the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, known as CARP, who is represented here today; the Public Interest Advocacy Centre; and the Consumers Council of Canada, who is also represented here today. I thank you for your advocacy, I thank you for your input and I thank you for your support.", "I’m also pleased to note that a number of municipalities have passed motions supporting the bill and urging a provincial of ban on door-to-door sales of products in the home services sector. They include—and this is not an exhaustive list—the cities of Brampton, Hamilton, Markham, Mississauga, Oshawa and Pickering, the townships of North Dundas and Wellington North and the city of Toronto, amongst others. To me, this reflects the fact this is a concern to people north to south and east to west across Ontario. It’s not just an urban problem; it’s not just a suburban problem; it’s not just a rural problem; it’s a problem across Ontario.", "This issue has been covered widely by the media. I alluded to that earlier. I think this highlights again that it’s an issue that concerns people across the province. It’s not just media in Toronto that covered this. It’s not just NewsTalk 1010 or CBC radio that I talked about earlier. It’s Global News. It’s CP24. It’s the Etobicoke Guardian. It’s Metro News. It’s the Caledon Enterprise. It’s the Newmarket Era.

The salesperson targets Chinese residents, especially the frail seniors, into signing a contract they don’t understand. Current law prevents companies from activating the contract prior to the cooling-off period. I heard cases in my riding where the overzealous employee removed both furnace and air conditioner prior to the cooling-off period.” This is just one example of many MPPs who have spoken up on this issue in support.", "Consumers have spoken, advocacy groups have spoken, municipalities have spoken and MPPs have spoken. It’s time to take action.", "I started my remarks by sharing that I was inspired by my seniors’ advisory group, by seniors in my community who raised this issue with me.

I know we’ve all heard those stories.", "It is beyond reprehensible to me that some organizations make a living, have a business model that’s based on taking advantage of vulnerable people. We have to take action to protect Ontarians and end these predatory practices. I ask all members of this House for their support.

Back in 2002, we brought forward a 10-day cooling-off period. If you want to extend that, I’m happy to debate that, but that gave you a chance to get out of contracts after 10 days. We had significant sentences and fines, up to $500,000 for a corporation or $50,000 for a business. I think that’s a much better way to approach this issue than the sledgehammer of banning all these businesses, potentially, and treating seniors as unable to advocate for themselves or make wise decisions." ],

If passed, this bill would introduce legislation that would ban the sale, lease or rent of specific products at a consumer’s home.

Since being elected, I continue to receive calls, emails and constituents in my office urging that something be done to address door-to-door sales. So I’m pleased with the introduction of this bill by my colleague MPP Baker, the member for Etobicoke Centre, which, if passed, would help tackle the issue by banning door-to-door sales of products.", "While this is an issue that goes across all ages, it’s alarming to see how often door-to-door salespeople target those who may be more vulnerable, take advantage of them, force them to buy products or services at skyrocketing rates, and lock them into contracts with monthly payments and no way out.", "As you know, Speaker, I represent the riding of Davenport, which is home to a large senior population and home to many immigrants and newcomers.

A protected consumer and an informed consumer is always the best route. It allows for flexibility. It allows the industry to grow and hopefully get large enough that they have their own retail outlets. Especially in the trades, it’s very hard to go out and purchase a large business.

It has actually been in committee, where we’ve had some hearings dates.

We saw, as the member pointed out, that when it came to electricity marketing there was a huge amount of outcry on the part of the seniors’ community for people who signed themselves in and locked themselves in to some pretty expensive electricity contracts that they were stuck with having to pay. It actually took members of the assembly coming into this House and raising it day after day in question period and at every opportunity that finally the Conservative government, I believe, or it might have been the Liberal government—I don’t remember; it was one of the two—actually brought in a bill to somewhat regulate those people, because it was really getting to be a problem.", "I remember, as other members in this House and, I’m sure, the member from Niagara—" ],

I would imagine this bill will get passed at second reading—we’ll find out when we vote later. I don’t see why we wouldn’t. But the process by which to pass a bill is one that’s very dependent on your own caucus, because the way it works is, normally we try to negotiate at the end of session, spring and fall, a package of one, two or three private members’ bills from each caucus.

I’ve had my kids sign contracts for summer employment, and I said, “Did you read the contract?” and they’re embarrassed, because no. All they were doing was working at a summer camp. But in that contract, it says things that they might not be responsible for. That made me uncomfortable, that you raise your kids to think before they sign, and they go ahead and sign a contract.", "We need more than Band-Aid fixes, and I have a feeling that this is a Band-Aid fix: You’ll still be able to find seniors—you’ll still be able to find vulnerable people—and sell to them, just at other places.", "We just saw legislation pass for payday loans. Instead of working it so that banks could somehow supply low-cost bank accounts for people who don’t have normal bank accounts, we’re just seeing that people can get a loan from one payday loan place and then go down the street and go to another payday loan place.", "So it doesn’t really solve the problem.

This legislation takes important steps to protect those who have been subjected to aggressive and coercive sales tactics.", "The riding of York South–Weston, which I have the privilege of representing, has a high number of seniors and also new immigrants and people who speak English as a second language, who are vulnerable to these kinds of devious sales tactics.", "When I say “devious,” anybody could fall prey to these tactics. I had someone who knocked on my door and said that they worked for the government of Ontario. I knew better, but there are people who are new to Canada, and that could be very intimidating to them. They will let that person in.", "Time and time again, my constituency office has had to come to the rescue of a number of constituents who have fallen prey to fraudulent sales representatives. Mr. Speaker, it is time for this practice to end.", "I would like to demonstrate the significance of this legislation by providing just a few examples of how my constituents have been affected by these unfair schemes. For example, one of my constituents was targeted by a company that promised to install a new furnace and AC. The sales representative urged the constituent to sign the contract right there in front of him and threatened that, if he didn’t sign immediately, he would lose the opportunity to receive the government’s heating-and-cooling incentive. The constituent signed the contract and was told that someone would install the unit the next day.", "Fortunately, the next day, he decided to call my constituency office. We promptly contacted the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, who advised us that this contractor was not on the list of participating contractors in the heating-and-cooling incentive. As a result, the constituent immediately cancelled the contract and, luckily, there was no financial loss in this specific case.", "However, not all of my constituents and people across Ontario have been so fortunate, Mr. Speaker, to survive without being robbed of hundreds of dollars. In another instance, for example, I was contacted by the son of an elderly couple who were approached in their home by a sales representative of an HVAC company who inspected their eight-and-a-half-year-old furnace, which was supposedly installed by the same company in the past. The couple were told that the pressure switch and the flame sensor were not working and to pay $600 right on the spot in order to fix it.", "The next day, the furnace was not working. The same representative came back, could not get the furnace to work and advised the elderly couple that they needed a new furnace and took the old one with them. So this couple was left without a furnace and robbed of hundreds of dollars, and we had to contact, again, the ministry to fix the issue.", "Mr. Speaker, I feel that this bill is really important for all of us and all the consumers in Ontario, and therefore, I support it wholeheartedly." ],

Welcome to Queen’s Park.", "Brain tumours are not an issue that typically receive a great deal of attention from the public. The goal of this bill is to start that conversation about brain tumour awareness and to do that all year long, but specifically to kick it off each May. We know that this is an illness that can affect anyone. The brain is the most important organ in the body. It controls our five senses, as well as the ability to speak and move. Brain tumours are surprisingly common, and symptoms can be subtle. Every day, 27 Canadians hear the words, “You have a brain tumour.” An estimated 55,000 people across Canada live with brain tumours.", "One of these individuals was Evan Leversage. Evan was from the small Ontario community of St. George, near Brantford. Evan was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour. In December 2015, doctors told Evan’s family that they were unsure if Evan would live to see Christmas, and perhaps they should celebrate early. You’ll probably remember the community’s reaction. It came together in an outpouring of love and support for Evan and his family to ensure that Evan’s celebrated that Christmas. An estimated 7,000 people joined the celebration, more than double the population of St. George. Supporters lined Evan’s street, cheering as he passed by homes lit by Christmas lights, decorations and even fake snow. The photos of Evan sitting next to Santa in his sleigh with a smile on his face were magical. Sadly, Evan died December 6 of last year.", "Brain tumours also impact the strongest in our community. Newmarket Hurricanes hockey player Kevin Lord died in 2006 of brain cancer. Kevin was young, strong and fit. He was a dedicated athlete, teammate and friend to many in both the hockey and ball hockey communities. Each year, the Newmarket Hurricanes, an Ontario Junior Hockey League team, holds the Battle of York, a benefit hockey game that pits the Aurora Tigers against the Newmarket Hurricanes in memory of Kevin. A portion of the proceeds of the game go to Southlake regional hospital’s cancer centre. To date, this event has raised $50,000.", "Top of mind when we think about brain tumours, perhaps, is the announcement recently that the frontman for the Tragically Hip, Gord Downie, has an incurable form of brain cancer. We were all stunned. Gord’s family, friends and fans have rallied around him as he vows one final tour with the band. It will be a remarkable tour.", "Madam Speaker, this is personal. My family has been touched by brain tumours. My wonderful, wonderful father-in-law, Marvin Green, died of a brain tumour 11 years ago. It seems like just yesterday. Another family member who’s rather shy and didn’t want her name used was diagnosed at age nine with a brain tumour. Her outcome was much brighter. She was successfully treated at SickKids. Now, as a vibrant young woman, she is expecting her first child soon.", "When you look at the stories of Evan, Kevin and every other person who has lost the fight against brain tumours, and those who have survived, there are a few similarities. Brain tumours do not seem to target a specific type of person. They don’t discriminate between young and old, women or men. It appears that there is simply no reasoning behind it.", "This private member’s bill is a product of conversations between myself and organizations such as the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada. This terrific organization was founded in London, Ontario in 1982 by Stephen Northey, who lost his eight-year-old daughter Kelly to a brain tumour. Dr. Rolando Del Maestro, a neurosurgeon, and Pamela Del Maestro, a neuroscience nurse, are also founders. Since its founding over 34 years ago, the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada has been dedicated to helping to find the cause and cure for brain tumours.", "The Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada is also an active participant in the International Brain Tumour Alliance, which works with organizations in over 100 countries around the world. These organizations focus on raising awareness of brain tumours, advocating for positive change and supporting brain tumour research.", "Through conversations with the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada, I have learned that one of the biggest hurdles in finding a cure for brain tumours is the lack of data. To date, Canada has relied on data from a number of American and Canadian data resources to guide Canadian research, raise awareness, secure government funding and provide support programs. This data is not necessarily a true reflection of Canada’s brain tumour community.", "In moving towards a cure, the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada established the Canadian brain tumour registry in November 2012. This project will count every person with a brain tumour in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, which accounts for approximately 90% of the brain tumour cases in Canada. Having this information will accelerate advocacy efforts to ensure equal access to drugs, treatments and services for all brain tumour patients. Collecting this data will bring us one step closer to finding a cure.", "Our government understands there are many steps that we need to take to fight brain tumours, including investing and learning more about the brain’s function. That’s why, in 2013, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and the Ministry of Research and Innovation partnered to provide the Ontario Brain Institute with up to $100 million—$20 million a year—over five years. This funding is helping to sustain and expand the Ontario Brain Institute’s coordination and commercialization support for neuroscience research.", "However, there is always more work that can be done to further this conversation, which is why I’m presenting this bill. As I mentioned at the opening, for several years the month of October has been recognized as Brain Tumour Awareness Month. In an effort to raise the profile of this disease, the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada has chosen to highlight May as Brain Tumour Awareness Month, aligning itself with the United States and the province of British Columbia. If passed, this bill will see Ontario declare May as Brain Tumour Awareness Month to build awareness.", "Personally, I’m putting forward this bill for Evan Leversage, Gord Downie, Kevin Lord, Charles Mott, Ben Diplock, Marvin Green, and every other person who has been touched by this terrible disease.", "I want to make one final comment. Ben and Charles have proven that brain tumours are not always fatal. When an Ontario resident is told, “You have a brain tumour,” it need not be a sentence of death.", "I’d like to read this quote from brain tumour survivor Ben Diplock, the young fellow who grew up on the street where I was raised. At the press conference I held last week, Ben said this: “After the operation to remove my tumour, my parents were told that I would never ride a bike, drive a car, or learn at the same pace as my classmates. Yet, I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by health care providers, loved ones and mentors who instilled in me the belief that I was capable of anything to which I put my mind. And with this positivity, I learned to ride a bike, drive a car, and graduated from university with honours.”", "I might add that young Ben has dedicated his life to finding a cure for brain tumours. As I mentioned earlier, he’s currently a clinical research coordinator at Sunnybrook Research Institute.", "It’s my hope that this bill, in some small way, will help in brain tumour prevention and cure and help raise support for those living with a brain tumour. I look forward to the support of those opposite and everyone in this House as we move this bill forward.", "Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, for the opportunity to rise today and discuss this important topic." ],

She was able to come through that treatment with full restoration of her abilities, and a full life. It was a tough time for her, a tough time for her husband, and certainly, for them, months—actually, when you think about it, years—of trepidation.", "Another constituent was working with me on an issue in my riding about two years ago, and suddenly, one evening, just said, “I can’t make it to the meeting. I’ve got this brain tumour diagnosis. I’ve got to drop all this stuff. I’ve got to focus on my health. I’m going to have an operation within a week or two.”", "I hadn’t heard from her for a while. I was canvassing through my riding about a month ago, going door to door, knocked on the door, and there she was, looking great. She had gone through a very difficult time, but was fully restored to all her faculties, the diagnosis behind her, her life ahead of her. The simple reality is that even with our limited knowledge now—and it is limited—the potential is there for effective treatment that allows people to take hold of and live their full lives.", "We shouldn’t be surprised that people are working on this issue. People have worked on and continue to work on a variety of cancer issues. A number of years ago, Speaker—you and I were representing the same area at the time—I brought forward a bylaw in the city of Toronto to ban smoking in restaurants and bars. It was quite an experience because on the one hand, we had everyone who was pro-smoking or who, if they weren’t in favour of smoking, felt that having smoking was critical to the success of their restaurant or bar; and on the other hand, we had oncologists, surgeons and people who had spent far more than their fair share of time in cancer wards.", "It was a profound battle because what I heard from the pro-smoking side was that if you stopped smoking in bars and restaurants in Toronto, the city would be hollowed out. Tourists would never come here again. It would be the end of economic life as we know it and the beginning of the dark ages. As you are well aware, Speaker, that in fact didn’t happen. Tourists still come to Toronto, birds still sing in the sky, the sun still shines, and people can make advances in dealing with environmental factors that cause cancer.", "I don’t know enough about brain tumours; I don’t know enough about the environmental factors, the genetic factors, or others that play into the origin of the disease in any one individual, but it’s pretty clear that there are cancers, like lung cancer, that could be traced very commonly to environmental causes, tobacco smoke being one of them.", "A number of years ago, I had the opportunity in this Legislature to bring forward a private member’s bill, the Community Right to Know Act, something that’s in place in California. We got through second reading here; we got through committee here. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to get it passed into law. But in California, if you have a product the use of which will expose people to carcinogens, you have to reveal that on the label of your product. What they found in California was that a number of companies reformulated their products to eliminate elements like benzene or other common carcinogenic substances that were in everyday products that people were using.", "I think that enough people in this chamber and enough people in this community—and community writ large, Ontario—have had to deal with cancer that there is momentum and will to take the issue on, notwithstanding the fact that, from time to time, when you take on these big issues, you come up against those who have an economic interest in life and death continuing as they have for a long time.", "I want to commend the member for doing this.

It definitely brings a great, great impact to Canadian life.", "But at the same time, I know that institutions such as Princess Margaret, SickKids and the University of Toronto—these great institutions in my riding are working very, very hard to find a cure for cancer.

They know that they are different than the rest of people. But the kids—not too much. They move on; they’re happy. But although those were comforting words to me, it was heart-wrenching. It was very touching to hear that.", "I absolutely believe that more resources should be put behind cancer research, to find a cure as early as possible.", "I also want to take this opportunity to give credit to Gilda’s Club Greater Toronto. They do good work, not just in my riding but across the city. Every year for the last three years, I have participated in their charity run—actually a walk, a 5K walk—to raise money and raise awareness for the good work they do.

A friend of my wife from school just found out that her husband—very active, loved to play golf, loved to travel—has brain cancer, had a tumour removed but, of course, the diagnoses are never great. I say that not because I think of him as any different than anybody else. I think that everybody in this House would probably have more than a handful of people they know who are either living with it or have suffered from it. It is a major disease and, unfortunately, usually fatal.", "So it’s something that I think we have to do more with than awareness. In this case here, there’s nothing you can do yourself, so what we can do is take action and look at putting a stop to it and bringing research along so at least there’s better treatment and so that it’s not the death sentence that we see today." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to have the opportunity to speak today on behalf of the residents of Hamilton Mountain as we consider Bill 211, the Brain Tumour Awareness Month Amendment Act.", "Currently, Brain Tumour Awareness Month is recognized in October in the province of Ontario and the purpose of this bill before us is to change that to May. I think it’s for a good reason. May is Brain Tumour Awareness Month in both British Columbia and the US, and has been declared as such in Yellowknife, Calgary, Welland and Niagara Falls. By aligning Ontario with other northern jurisdictions, we increase the impact of brain tumour awareness, pooling our resources and working for a common good by recognizing it in the same month across the continent.", "There are approximately 55,000 Canadians living with brain tumours and another 27 are added each and every day. The Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada was founded 34 years ago in London, Ontario. They raise funds to lead research into the cause of and cure for the disease. They also run support groups and conferences to share information. They distribute the BrainStorm newsletter as well as provide handbooks and an online peer support centre. The foundation is a wonderful resource for the brain tumour community and I thank them for their excellent work. Just last week, on May 29, the Hamilton-Niagara branch held their Brain Tumour Walk at Dofasco park and raised an amazing $42,000 to help pay for all of the work that they do.", "Speaker, as I was doing a bit of reading and research about brain tumours, I was surprised to find that there are 120 different types of brain tumours. We also know that there are a number of ways in which they can affect those they harm.", "I want to recount the experience of one person I know who has been affected by a brain tumour. At the age of 10 months, his parents started to notice that sometimes he would go into sort of a trance, just gaze into space with a vacant look on his face. It didn’t happen often, it didn’t happen regularly. There was no rhyme or reason; it just happened from time to time. When it did happen, they would pick him up and they would hold him close and a few minutes later he would come around and go back and play just as any other young child would do.", "They took him to the doctor and after a short consultation they were told that what they were seeing was a learned behaviour. Their son, in just the few short months of his life, had worked out that if he wanted a cuddle all he had to do was gaze into space. They left the doctor’s office hopeful that their son’s actions had been explained, but they were not entirely convinced.", "When an episode happened again a few weeks down the road, they held back. Difficult as it was to do, they left him alone. They watched him stand there with a blank gaze on his face and swaying a little. Slowly he came around and, as before, he carried on to play. It happened again and they made another appointment with their doctor. Again, the learned behaviour explanation was put forward. It takes a while to unlearn behaviour, they were told. More episodes followed, and more visits to the doctor. The symptoms remained the same.", "Eventually, not long after his second birthday, they managed to get a referral to a pediatric neurologist. The neurologist couldn’t see anything that might be causing these episodes, but they got him admitted to the McMaster Children’s Hospital for closer examination and observation. After a couple of days, no explanation had been found and he was about to the discharged.", "As you know, Speaker, McMaster is a highly respected teaching hospital and, just as luck would have it, a young student doctor noticed that there was a very slight limp in the young boy as he walked through the ward—not much, but enough to make people take another look.", "A CT scan was ordered and, as a result, it came back as a shock to the family. After trying to understand the medical terminology being used to explain the situation, the parents had to ask the doctor, “Do you mean he has a brain tumour?” “Yes,” came the reply. It was about the size of a large orange.", "Just as this was all being explained to the parents, suddenly the space behind them erupted in activity as doctors and nurses rushed to the child’s bedside, as he had a serious convulsion. After the seizure had ended, the doctors had a chance to discuss the next steps and the parents were told that surgery was needed immediately. He spent the next five months in the hospital, during which he had three surgeries, lasting a total of 25 hours. The first was the longest and most traumatic. As the highly skilled team tried to remove the tumour, one of the major blood vessels began to erupt in his brain.", "When the exhausted neurosurgeon, an exceptionally compassionate, honest man, came out, he told the parents that he didn’t know if he had done their son any favours. He didn’t know what the future held. The good news was that the tumour wasn’t malignant. It had grown throughout the pregnancy. It would be the same size no matter what time they had found it. He had a large tumour in his brain the size of an orange when he was born. The pressure within his small head must have been immense.", "It was highly traumatic, and the effects remain. He is paralyzed on one side of his body—one quick second, Speaker; I’m almost there—and he has no peripheral vision on his left side. At the age of five or six, he started to have seizures. Medication was able to control it. Now he is able to live a pleasant, fulfilling life." ],

I have the privilege of working with Chris Ballard on a day-to-day basis and to speak with him regularly. I know how passionate he is about this topic. I know how hard he works on behalf of his constituents in Newmarket–Aurora. I think this is just another example of his good work, not just on behalf of his constituents but on behalf of folks across Ontario, on an issue that’s important to so many people.", "So many of the members who have risen have talked about brain tumours and the impact they can have on people. What I want to do is just focus my few minutes on how important it is that we do what Chris Ballard is asking us to do, which is to raise awareness about an issue that touches so many in such a profound way.", "The first thing I wanted to note is that changing the Brain Tumour Awareness Month from October to May would align Ontario with both British Columbia and the United States to create a North American Brain Tumour Awareness Month. I really applaud MPP Ballard for this, to create this alignment, because with improved organization across North America, more people will get the opportunity to learn about brain tumours and recognize their devastating impact. I think that coordination is important.", "We can all think of causes that we’ve raised awareness of across Canada or across North America and, as a result, we’ve seen positive results. In Canada, an estimated 55,000 people live with brain tumours, which is about 27 people diagnosed a day. That’s a really incredible number. I was shocked to hear that. Of course, in the US, the number is about 10 times that amount.", "Brain tumours don’t discriminate. They affect people of all ages, but it is one of the most common forms of cancer in children.", "Furthermore, coming from my background of business, I understand not only the communication reach that could be achieved by aligning these efforts but also the potential for sharing resources across jurisdictions. Rather than duplicating efforts across the year in different jurisdictions by having different brain tumour awareness months, aligning with the US, British Columbia and others will vastly improve the capability of our local volunteer organizations as well, such as the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada, to utilize their resources to the best of their capability.", "Our brain performs, of course, some of the most basic and important functions in our body. It gives us the ability to move, sense and feel emotions. It is its highly developed nature that sets us apart from millions of other living things on earth. That is one of the reasons why a brain tumour can have such a profound impact, not only on a person’s health but on their quality of life. By aligning these efforts, I think we’re doing an excellent thing.", "I can just say that, in my community, one issue that has been of great concern is Alzheimer’s and dementia. I recently had a consultation on our dementia strategy as a government. One of the things that came out of it was that someone who is an expert in the field got up and talked about the value of raising awareness in an aligned way. He spoke about the fact—in the context of Alzheimer’s and dementia, but I think it applies to this as well—that through awareness, through communication, we not only educate, but we create impetus for actions to be taken that will resolve this problem. If we were to resolve this problem, we know that we would have a meaningful impact on tens of thousands of people across Ontario and a profound impact on the quality of life for the people of Ontario.", "For that reason, I support this bill. I hope we can all support the bill that has been put forward by the member for Newmarket–Aurora." ],

This bill isn’t to create a month of awareness; it is to change that month from October to May so it can be aligned with other jurisdictions so that we can have a North American awareness month.", "I want to mention very quickly that there are probably other, more important bills that we could be debating, including my two private member’s bills, which seem to be locked in never-never land.", "We need to see time and money being spent on research, but this bill does support that, because what an awareness month does is help facilitate the charities that are fundraising to support the research we need. It helps them by having this month, because they also focus their resources and work together, and usually run their galas and fundraising programs during this month.", "Just yesterday, I toured the University Health Network’s new facility for research, which is very close to here—just walking distance. It’s the Krembil research facility. They’re struggling to get grants to do research. I specifically spoke to people about Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. These are all very important, Madam Speaker, as we know. There should be less effort made by these researchers just trying to get government funding; they should be focusing on the research itself.", "As a former optometrist, I just want to mention that one of things optometrists do is diagnose brain tumours. I’m going to give just a little bit of a description of what is called the optic chiasm. “Chiasm” is from the Greek letter that’s like an X. We have the optic nerve from each eye crossing in the back of the brain into an X. Depending on people’s visual fields, if they’re losing part of their vision, we’re able to test it now—we’ve got very fancy computerized equipment to do visual field testing.", "I’m just going to say that one of the symptoms of a brain tumour is missing part of your peripheral vision. For example, if you’re missing both the right and left from the centre out—everybody is going to go home, close one eye, point to something and do the little wiggle test to make sure they can see way out there. But if you’re missing the right and left temporal quadrants, that is bitemporal hemianopsia, as we call it, and that means that the tumour is right in the middle of that X. Then, depending where you’ve lost vision—if it’s a quarter quadrant, if it’s both or a quarter here and a quarter there—that will tell us where along the nerve the tumour is. Then, people go for a CAT scan or an MRI and, sure enough, the tumour often ends up being exactly where we were able to predict.", "So it’s very important that people who are having headaches or loss of peripheral vision take it very seriously, and when they make those appointments, that they explain their symptoms carefully and don’t just call and say, “I’m getting headaches.” They have to say, “I don’t normally get migraine headaches, and suddenly I’m having migraine headaches,” and ensure that they’re being seen quickly enough; to keep the pressure going until they’re seen, because time is of the essence, as we know.", "As we’ve heard, 27 people a day in Canada are diagnosed with brain cancers. This means that 55,000 are living with brain tumours. I think that, while there are many awareness months, as we heard, and some of them might sound a little peculiar, raising awareness of the symptoms of brain tumours—not just having a month to recognize that people have brain tumours, but using that awareness to warn people of what the symptoms are so they seek the medical attention, which is so readily available in our wonderful province, to ensure they get the earliest diagnosis and earliest treatment with the best outcome. That’s what it’s about, and I’m very happy to support this bill to move the awareness month." ],

I’m delighted to hear a lot of support around the chamber for changing Brain Tumour Awareness Month to May to align with other Canadian provinces. That’s no small feat, and it really does help to add to this debate why we need to do it.", "When I look down at the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada information sheet—it’s very, very important to have this information out there. It’s been said before in this debate that every day 27 Canadians hear the words “You have a brain tumour.” Now, think about that for a moment. Madam Speaker, I’ve been on the scene with families when they received that news from their physician, and it’s devastating. It’s devastating for children. I recall the first time that I had a little two-year-old at SickKids, and her parents were in the room with us when they had the devastating news from the physician. The father promptly fainted. This was a sign of how devastating it is to families.", "As a nurse, I was only able to offer so much comfort there, and it was very helpful, then, to be able to give some of the resources to the families from organizations such as the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada, to be able to go to them for information.", "The second time I heard that was from one of my friends who had just reached her 40th birthday. She complained a bit about having her 40th birthday and feeling over the hill. About two months after her birthday, she had been having some symptoms back and forth and she got the news that she, indeed, had a brain tumour. She said to me, “You know, here I was complaining about my 40th birthday, but the alternative is far worse.”", "In looking at ways we can try and relieve some of the issues around this, in terms of emotions and in terms of awareness, one of the benefits that we have of being able to have a Brain Tumour Awareness Month is really getting the information out there. You may have noted that some of your neighbours, your friends and your family have been having some indescribable symptoms and you might think that maybe that’s something happening in their brain, that maybe they need a bigger checkup. Maybe you need to go to a physician and say, “I noticed my family member is having a bit of a limp and their speech is off just a little bit or their vision is off a little bit. Can we please check for things?” It gives families a place to go to be able to look into some of the symptoms they might have, because as we know, early diagnosis means that we’re certainly able to treat the disease far more.", "In closing, I wanted to just give a shout-out to the member for bringing this forward.

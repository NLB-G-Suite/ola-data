As the longest-serving woman MPP ever elected in this province, she has represented her constituents well for more than 22 years, successfully contesting six elections between 1995 and 2014, and achieving a remarkable milestone for women in Ontario.", "Speaker, let’s reflect on what the Ontario Legislature looked like in 1995, the year Julia was first elected as MPP. Of the 130 MPPs who would be taking their seats at Queen’s Park that year, just 19 were women, who made up 14.6% of the provincial Legislature. Of the 82 Progressive Conservatives who were elected to the PC caucus, only 11 were women, making up just 13.4% of all PC members of the Legislature.", "As the Globe and Mail reported shortly after the 1995 PC victory: “Welcome to the new 82-member Conservative caucus at Queen’s Park, which met for the first time this week. It’s almost completely white, mainly male, with the overwhelming majority of its members coming from small business backgrounds.”", "I suspect the member for York–Simcoe was unfazed to find herself among her new colleagues. After all, both of her 1995 campaign opponents were men, and one was an incumbent, so she could certainly hold her own in the male-dominated world of politics.", "With her husband, John, she managed both the family farm as well as a dog breeding business, making her as knowledgeable as any of her male colleagues about the challenges of running a small business. As a secondary school educator for 28 years prior to her election, one can imagine that her discipline and classroom management skills were certainly an asset.", "A rookie MPP, Munro was appointed as parliamentary assistant to the Premier to promote volunteerism, prompting the Ottawa Citizen to comment: “Munro is a rare creature in Premier Mike Harris’s government. She’s actually been asked to come up with ideas rather than simply end, repeal or reduce things.”", "Julia Munro was born in Hamilton in 1942 and was raised in Toronto. After graduating with a BA in history from the University of Toronto, she began her career as a teacher in 1971. After 24 years teaching history in Markham, she became a secondary school department head for the York Region Board of Education.", "Like many women who become involved in political life, Julia saw a problem and wanted to fix it. A Toronto Star article covering the 1995 race states: “Munro says she used to sit around the kitchen table complaining about the state of politics and finally decided she had to get involved.”", "She became active in her local PC riding association, serving as riding president from 1992 to 1994, and she put her name on the ballot in 1995 for the riding then known as Durham–York. In 1999, she was re-elected in York North, a seat she held in 2003 despite the defeat of the government. She was re-elected in 2007, 2011 and, most recently, in 2014.", "I asked my NDP colleagues for juicy stories about Julia that I could share in my tribute. The thing is, there are none. She is always prepared and always professional. Her style is calm and reassuring, practical and unruffled. During legislative debates, her remarks are well structured and well researched. In committee, she is known for her ability to ask pointed questions that cut right to the core of an issue. Instead of juicy stories, what my colleagues did tell me about was Julia’s warm smile, her droll sense of humour and her dry wit, and the twinkle in her eye when one would least expect it.", "The member for Kitchener–Waterloo told me about the advice she received from Julia after the 2014 election. Noticing my NDP colleague despondent and alone in the dining room, Julia asked what was wrong. She listened carefully, reflected on what had been shared, nodded and said, “Catherine, the best thing you can do is sleep.” This quiet bit of wisdom exemplifies Julia’s pragmatic approach and helped change my colleague’s perspective on life at Queen’s Park. Julia still checks in every once in a while to see how the member for Kitchener–Waterloo is doing and whether she is following the advice that was imparted.", "Throughout her political career, Julia has been deeply committed to encouraging citizen participation in political life. Interviewed during her 2011 election campaign, she emphasized that an engaged citizenry is the key to our system and warned against the erosion of democracy that is caused by cynicism or apathy. Speaker, of all her accomplishments, this is perhaps Julia Munro’s most important legacy. For that, all Ontarians, and Ontario women in particular, are richer." ],

This is a truly impressive achievement and one we should all be proud of.", "For 21 years, the member from York–Simcoe has been serving the people of Ontario. For 21 years, she has been the voice for the people in her riding. No question: Her presence in the Legislature over the past 21 years is truly inspiring. The member has served her constituents and the people of Ontario longer than any other woman in our province. Just think about that. There was a time when people thought that there was no place for women in politics. Well, they were wrong. There is a place—room—for women in politics, and women like MPP Munro are living proof of that.", "No matter how far we’ve come, as Ontario’s first-ever Minister of the Status of Women I know that it is trailblazers like the member for York–Simcoe who have paved the way for women, and I thank her for that. She is a change-maker. The world has changed a lot over the last 21 years. More and more women are now getting involved in government, getting elected and becoming our leaders. Much of that is due to the strong and successful women in the Legislature, right here—women like the member for York–Simcoe, women who have shown us that it is possible to dream and it is possible to make that dream a reality.", "Throughout her career, MPP Munro has inspired many people and broken many barriers. It is especially fitting that we are recognizing the member today because this is the start of International Women’s Week. Later this week, we will also recognize International Women’s Day. This year’s theme is “Equality Matters,” and yes, it does.", "For our government, gender equality is of critical importance. As I look around this House, I see that two of our three party leaders, Premier Kathleen Wynne and NDP leader Andrea Horwath, are women. I also see Elizabeth Dowdeswell, our female Lieutenant Governor, and our new female Sergeant-at-Arms, Jackie Gordon. I see a cabinet appointed by our Premier that is 40% women, the highest percentage in Ontario’s history, and I see a government that has set a target of 40% of all provincial board and agency appointments by 2019.", "We are doing this because we are challenging not only ourselves but businesses as well to put more women in positions of leadership. We are doing this because gender diversity in Ontario leadership benefits us all. And we are doing this because, absolutely, it’s the right thing to do.", "The member’s service to Ontario benefits and inspires us all.

First elected in June 1995, Julia Munro, our respected colleague from York–Simcoe, now stands as Ontario’s longest-serving woman member of Parliament. Today, she has surpassed 7,944 days as a member of this Legislature.", "Julia’s career at Queen’s Park spans six consecutive provincial elections, three riding name changes, representing Durham–York, York North and York–Simcoe. After her first victory in the 1995 election, Julia was named parliamentary assistant to the Premier in the newly elected Mike Harris government. She would go on to serve as government whip, parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Transportation, the Chair of Management Board of Cabinet and Minister of Culture in subsequent Parliaments. And that is when things changed for Julia and our fellow colleagues, as the next election and the three to follow relegated “team blue” to official opposition status. Yet Julia continued her work as an MPP without missing a beat, understanding and respecting her role and representing her constituents with the same energy and care.", "In opposition, Julia has served as critic for culture twice, seniors twice, children’s services twice, community and social services twice and the Poverty Reduction Strategy three times, along with sitting on 13 different committees. That’s what happens when you stick around so long.", "Through all the years, with her beloved husband, John, and daughter, Genevieve, by her side, Julia’s devotion and dedication to politics and serving in office have never wavered. Julia has always been passionate about her policy work. An avid dog lover and breeder, Julia has fought for animal rights, regulations and standards of care. With her keen interest in the financial health and security of Ontarians, Julia introduced new legislation to establish a small business bill of rights and, most notably, advocated for her bill on pooled registered pension plans twice.", "As some of you may know, Julia was not always a politician. Prior to her time at Queen’s Park, Julia worked as an educator, serving the majority of her time as a high school history teacher. Not surprisingly, her reputation with her students reflected the level of commitment and perspective she imparted on their learning.", "Kicking up the cool factor, even for a history teacher, one of Julia’s former students was Tyler Stewart, the drummer of the infamous Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies. In an interview for Professionally Speaking magazine for a story entitled “The Barenaked Ladies Remarkable Teachers,” when Tyler was asked to choose the high school teacher who had the greatest impact on him, he chose Julia Munro. He praised her for her ability to make history interesting in a way that would relate to individual students’ interests. He went on to say, “I found that she really respected the intellect of her students. She really seemed to have a grasp of each kid’s capabilities and set jobs for them accordingly.”", "As much as Julia made history interesting for her students, she remains a history buff herself. Julia was asked who her political hero was, to which she answered Elizabeth Simcoe, also known as Elizabeth Gwillim. Elizabeth was a diarist, historian and artist, and the wife of the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe. Elizabeth’s diary and some 595 paintings left for us a vibrant story of life in colonial Ontario, and her name is lent to two townships in Julia’s riding, East and West Gwillimbury. That’s a testament to Julia’s love of history and government in one snapshot.", "To know Julia is to know honesty, integrity, sincerity and thoughtfulness personified. To work with Julia is to work with commitment, intention, compassion and conviction. Her success lies in a legacy of not only one fulfilled career, but two. Her bond with people, whether past students or current constituents, is based in genuine care, concern, admiration and respect. Julia has always seen her role as that of a conduit, saying, “The one promise I make to voters is to work hard and be accessible.... I have always kept in mind that I am here to speak up for my constituents.” There’s a humble grace for her purpose.", "As one of my dear colleagues reflected, she quietly and competently goes about her job, does it very well and never seeks the limelight. She draws attention to the issues she cares about but doesn’t try to draw attention to herself. She is beloved by her constituents and admired and respected by everyone at Queen’s Park, where she is often referred to as Lady Munro.", "It is only fitting that the former and distinguished history teacher who left her mark on her students so many years ago now leaves her own mark in our parliamentary history books as the longest-serving woman MPP in Ontario.

In his write-up, he described me as someone who had climbed out of the crib and crawled to the right. I thought that was okay. I didn’t mind that at all.", "I learned so much from the people who have passed through the halls of the Ontario Legislature, the people who have sat in the seats before us. I remember walking in here for the first time as an elected person and looking around the room, and at that point—I think it was the 36th Parliament, but I might be wrong. The point is that I sat down, I looked around the room, I saw all the chairs and I thought, “This is only the 36th time that somebody has come in and sat here. That’s overwhelming.” And to think that I’m one of them now, and to think that each of you is one of them, and the responsibility that that carries with it—it carries with it for today and the problems that we try to wrestle with today. It also speaks to the people who have gone before us, the people who have understood the important value of this building and what it stands for and the significance, and it has never left me, I’m pleased to say. I’m pleased to say that I can walk in here 21 years later and still feel that tremendous aura of what this building represents. I think our job as MPPs is to make sure that we contribute to that so that the next generation understands the value of what’s here.", "One of the things that I like to quote is one where it describes the system as a wild garden that needs tending.

The problem isn’t that a temporary job agency connects workers with employment. The problem is that people working through these temporary agencies are often seeing their salaries clawed back, and as much as 40% of their salary is clawed back by the temporary agency. Mr. Speaker, this is simply unfair.", "On top of that, workers who work through a temporary job agency do not receive benefits. This is unacceptable. This Liberal government has known about this problem for years. For over a decade, they have allowed this problem to not only continue but to flourish. It is simply unacceptable that people working beside a fellow colleague do not receive equal pay for equal work. That’s why I am calling on this government to ensure that this policy, this practice that is so hurtful, does not continue.", "We need to ensure that we have a province where workers receive equal pay for equal work. If you are working through a temporary job agency, you should not see any of your pay clawed back. In addition, you should receive full benefits. That is a minimum. That is a requirement that we should have in this province. I call on this government to implement a policy to ensure that people receive the fairness that they deserve." ],

Many small businesses will benefit from this cut as a part of the fair hydro plan that has been announced by Premier Wynne and Minister Thibeault this week. Bills won’t increase beyond the rate of inflation for at least four years. We are bringing hydro rates down by 25% and fixing the system’s structure.

By fixing problems in the system, we will be able to provide every residential customer in Ontario with an average of 25% off their bill.

Now available to even more low-income electricity consumers, consumers are able to apply online to receive $360 to $425 off per year on their bills through the OESP.", "Taken together, these changes will deliver the single largest reduction to electricity rates in Ontario’s history.

The Wyandot people were perhaps the first to live in the area of Toronto. They had a settlement on the banks of the Humber River. In 1750, the French established a trading post on the site of what are now the Exhibition grounds in Toronto. Not long after that, French North America was conquered by the British, and the site of Toronto became the capital of the province of Upper Canada.", "Since then, Toronto has always had an important role in Canadian history. Toronto welcomed the Loyalists fleeing persecution after the American Revolution. Toronto survived the War of 1812. The Rebellions of 1837 failed to shake Canadians’ attachment to the crown.

Macdonald’s vision of a transcontinental parliamentary monarchy was first developed in Toronto.", "When the writer Charles Dickens toured British North America in the 1840s, he found Toronto a vibrant and exciting place.

In many of those cases, challenges lay within the Child and Family Services Act, whether they be in child welfare, children’s mental health or youth justice. So I’m pleased to see this bill being brought forward so that we might debate it and give it a thorough review with public input at committee.", "It isn’t often that an act as extensive as the Child and Family Services Act, a bill that has enormous ramifications for our future as a province and, in particular, the future for some of our most vulnerable citizens, gets thrown out and replaced with a complete new act. If our child protection system is going to work, if it is going to do what it has to do for children and families, it must have the confidence of the public.", "Several events over the past number of years have caused that confidence to waver, to the extent that even the Premier contemplated blowing up the system. This new legislation is not the result of blowing up the system; far from it. Much of the language used in the new Child, Youth and Family Services Act comes directly from the existing act. But it is a new act, and it is important that we get it right.", "I’ll say right off the top that I am pleased to see some important foundational principles that are set out in the act. First and foremost, I was pleased to see that within the first few lines it states, “Service provided to children and families should be child-centred.” This, of course, was the central part of Katelynn’s Principle, which was recommended by the jury in the coroner’s inquest into the tragic death of young Katelynn Sampson, and also formed the content and provided the name of my recent private member’s bill, Bill 57.", "When Bill 89 was introduced back in December, the government made mention of it being consistent with Katelynn’s Principle, but I note there is no reference to Katelynn’s Principle in the act, and I will talk more about that point later in my speech. Nonetheless, I am pleased to see it recognized that children should be at the centre of decisions being made affecting them, and that they should have input into those decisions.", "I am pleased to see that language has been modernized to reflect the times we live in and to respect the children, families and communities served by the system, language that strives to ensure that the many facets and characteristics of Ontario’s diverse children and youth are given full consideration in the provision of services.", "I am pleased to see more stringent accountability measures being put into place. I am pleased that protection will now be extended to 16- and 17-year-olds. I am pleased that rules are proposed regarding the collection and use of data, and also that individuals can access their personal information held on them at no cost. So there are definitely good steps forward with this bill.", "Ontario New Democrats support any initiative that aims to keep children and youth safe and provide them and their families with the services and support that they need to reach their full potential. But I want to be clear: We certainly have some concerns with the bill as it is presented.", "First, and I have heard this from a broad range of stakeholders in the sector, many of the provisions laid out in the bill are severely lacking in detail, details that are important for us to understand exactly how these provisions will be implemented, details that will inform us on how the act will impact the operation of service providers and, more importantly, the lives of children and youth.", "All of these will be prescribed in regulations. Regulations that are not even written yet will determine how successful this legislation will be. Two hundred and six times, Speaker: That’s how often the words “prescribed” or “prescribe” appear in the body of the bill. This not only makes it difficult to properly evaluate the bill, but it also causes concern that important decisions will be made without any debate or input at the legislative level and with no guarantee of public consideration of changes.", "I would also suggest, Speaker, that the bill is overly fond of the word “may.” There are too many instances where actions are left to the discretion of the minister or other key individuals in the system rather than nailing them down in the legal requirements in legislation.", "I also think that opportunities have been missed to introduce some fundamental changes that would improve the lives and experiences of children, youth and families caught up in the system.", "Before I move on, there is one other very important point that I want to make, and again, I’ve heard this same point from many service providers. Adding requirements of service providers is all good and well, but if the funding to carry out those responsibilities is not made available, then we will all be in serious trouble. This sector is already seriously underfunded. Agencies and their workers are already pushed to their limits.", "We recently saw a strike at Peel CAS that had at its central issue caps of the workload in the workforce. Those workers were on strike, not for a pay raise but because of their concern that they were overloaded with cases and vulnerable children were not getting the attention they needed and deserve.", "Nipissing and Parry Sound CAS workers are currently locked out over issues of quality service that they want to provide but they can’t due to the lack of funding. Children’s aid societies used to be able to appeal for a top-up at the end of the year if they didn’t manage to stay within their budget. That is no longer the case. The funding formula has changed in recent years, with some societies getting less money and some getting more. But collectively, they are all operating with less money than they did previously.", "As CPIN is getting introduced, agencies are finding that they have to spend much more than they have been allocated to get it up and running. Workers report that many more hours are being spent trying to facilitate relatively straightforward operations on this new data program.", "Children’s Mental Health Ontario reports that there are 12,000 children and youth waiting to access mental health services. The sector has been screaming out for funding for years, but over the past 25 years there have only been two base funding increases: 3% in 2003 and 5% in 2006. Costs, meanwhile, have gone up drastically due to inflation, but also due to increased demand.", "We’ve made great strides forward in raising awareness in mental health. It is no longer the stigma that it was in years past, and that is a terrific move in the right direction. But if we can’t provide the services for that increased demand, we let everyone down. That is a concern I have with this bill. It’s fine to set the stage for better services, but if the money isn’t there to deliver those services, then it’s all just a shell game. In the long term, it costs us more. When we starve child welfare, children’s mental health and youth corrections, we pay the cost, with interest, down the road.", "Let me take a minute to offer a quick overview of the four schedules that make up this bill.", "Schedule 1 introduces the new Child, Youth and Family Services Act, the CYFSA, to replace the existing Child and Family Services Act, the CFSA. The paramount purpose of the act remains the same, that being to promote the best interests, protection and well-being of children.", "Schedule 2 amends the existing CFSA to include services for 16- and 17-year-olds on an interim basis, until such time as the new CYFSA is proclaimed.", "Schedule 3 will be enacted at the appropriate time, and it amends the CYFSA to decommission the Child Abuse Register when the Child Protection Information Network, also called CPIN, is fully operational.", "Schedule 4 amends 36 other acts to ensure they accurately reference the new CYFSA and its provisions.", "My remarks today will be focused on schedule 1 of the bill.", "I mentioned previously that I was pleased that reference to services being child-centred was made in the first three lines of the act. This comes within the preamble to the act and is the first stated principle of the government. Other principles in the same preamble are as follows:", "—support the reduction of more disruptive services and interventions through early intervention and prevention, and supports that build on family strengths;", "—respect diversity and the principle of inclusion, consistent with the Human Rights Code and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms;", "—a call for systemic barriers and racism to be addressed and inform the delivery of all services for children and families; and", "—expect child and family connections to their communities to be maintained wherever possible.", "The preamble also offers the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to be the touchstone for the Child, Youth and Family Services Act and as a foundation on which to build.", "The preamble goes on to give specific mention of First Nations, Inuit and Métis people as constitutionally recognized peoples with their own laws and distinct culture and political and historical ties to the province. It states that there should be a timely provision of services in accordance with Jordan’s Principle and recognizes the importance of First Nation, Inuit and Métis peoples belonging to a community or a nation, as written in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.", "These are all very commendable statements of principle that are collected together right at the front of the act, the first thing that you see when you open it up. I wouldn’t disagree with any of them and I am pleased to see them there.", "The question, though, is whether those principles are adequately reflected through the actual legislation and whether teeth are given to those stated principles to ensure that they are enforced. Sadly, I fear that this bill lacks the force of legislation required to back up those principles.", "As I go through the bill, it’s difficult to understand how the principles will be enforced, given that they will be subjected to interpretation and unspecified application.", "How, also, can we measure them to determine how good or bad we might be doing in relation to them? There are useful additions in the additional purposes of the act that provide a broader spectrum of characteristics that should be taken into account when services are provided.", "As we come to better understand the full diversity that exists throughout our communities, it is important that our laws reflect and support those realities. Race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, family diversity, disability, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression can all be vitally important in how a person understands themself. If we are to give children and youth the best start in life, we must give full consideration to their self-identity and allow them to flourish and develop confidence in who they are.", "An additional purpose that is carried over from the CFSA states: “While parents may need help in caring for their children, that help should give support to the autonomy and integrity of the family unit....”", "I think an opportunity has been missed in this bill to try to address a problem that I’m sure all members will be familiar with throughout their constituency work.", "The fact is that some families find our child welfare system impossibly difficult to navigate. They feel frustrated that people don’t listen to them. They feel outgunned by lawyers in court who know the system inside and out, while they can’t afford much, if any, legal representation.", "The Toronto Star recently reported on the Ontario Supreme Court ruling related to an ongoing investigation of cases connected to hair analysis done by the Motherisk laboratory at SickKids. I’m going to quote from their story from a couple of weeks ago:", "“This is the heart-rending dilemma depicted in a scathing Ontario Superior Court ruling that delivers a broad indictment of a ‘broken’ child welfare system. Justice Grant A. Campbell reveals how reliance on discredited hair testing from the Hospital for Sick Children’s Motherisk laboratory contributed to a ‘perfect storm’ of ‘errors, incompetence ... and mistakes.’ Throughout, the parents were ‘ignored, demeaned and disbelieved,’ while their child was shuffled between placements.", "“So significant was the damage that Campbell included an unqualified apology to the parents in his ruling, which he delivered orally in a Kitchener court last week.", "“‘It should not have happened. You should have been treated better,’ he said to the mother and father, identified by their initials, C.T. and J.B. ‘It did and you weren’t, and for that, on behalf of the very system that perpetrated this upon you, I apologize to you both.’”", "At the end of the day, it’s the child who suffers.", "I also remember a case from about two years ago when a child care provider suspected abuse of a child in her care and reported it, and the children’s aid society investigated the complaint and found it to be unfounded. Following on from this, the parents who had been the subject of the investigation chose to take the child care provider to court, suing her for the stress her report caused on them. The judge in the case ordered the child care provider to pay $10,000 in damages and also to pay the legal bill of over $3,000 for the parents.", "That whole scenario tells me that something is wrong with the way that sometimes things get done. There is a duty to report suspected abuse—not just known abuse, but suspected abuse, as well. That duty applies to everyone, but for people who work with children, it’s actually illegal for them not to report suspected abuse. A person working with children, including operators and employees of child care programs or centres, who fails to report abuse is liable of a conviction of up to $1,000—an amount, by the way, that will increase to $5,000 under the provisions of this new act.", "The duty to report is an important part of our child abuse and neglect strategy, but when the consequences of that reporting include families being so traumatized by the investigation that they are able to get a judge to order the person who reported to pay over $13,000, something isn’t right. On one hand, you tell people that they have a duty to report if they suspect abuse, and on the other, you say, “But, by the way, if you were wrong, you could end up in court.” That isn’t good for the protection of our children and youth.", "We don’t need anything that puts a chill on people who suspect abuse. We need everyone to have confidence in the system and not fear the possible consequences of reporting. Perhaps, Speaker, if we had language in this act to help families who come in contact with the system navigate their way through it, we could ease this concern. But I don’t see anything in the CYFSA that helps us find a way to support families in situations like this so that they, their extended family and friends can have confidence in a system that has a very difficult job to do.", "Part II of the act is devoted specifically to children’s and young persons’ rights. This is the part where we see the elements of Katelynn’s Principle being established in the act:", "—their right to express their own views on matters affecting them;", "—their right to be part of a dialogue to ensure they understand fully the reason decisions are being made about them;", "—the right to be consulted and advised;", "—the right to raise concerns;", "—the right to be informed in language suitable to their understanding of these rights; and", "—their right to be informed about the role of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, and how to contact that office.", "As I said, Speaker, this was taken from Katelynn’s Principle. Katelynn Sampson, as we all remember, was a seven-year-old girl who died after being brutally abused by her guardians. As the coroner’s inquest heard, her death was preceded by a number of failures in our system, not the least of which was the fact that nobody spoke to Katelynn.", "She was placed in the care of people who had a history of involvement with child welfare agencies. The case was passed from one agency to another with no follow-up. Her guardians themselves said that they couldn’t care for her. They called the agency asking to have Katelynn removed from their home. When the call was finally returned 16 days later, her guardian said that the school was taking care of it—a lie that was just accepted with no follow-up. The school reported concerns of abuse when Katelynn came to school with bruises all over her face and pink spots on her arms and hands. Nobody from children’s aid followed up, and neither did the school. Throughout all of this, nobody ever spoke to Katelynn.", "The inquest jury made 173 recommendations to prevent such a tragic series of events from happening again. The first among those recommendations was Katelynn’s Principle, so I am pleased to see it reflected in this bill. Children must be at the centre of any decision affecting them. They must be seen and listened to with respect. Their views must always be taken into account.", "But there are some ways, I believe, that the act does not fully reflect the intent of Katelynn’s Principle. Kaitlynn’s Principle was more demanding. It required that the rights stated in the act must be adhered to, not just that children and youth had those rights.", "There are also a couple of parts of Katelynn’s Principle that are missing from the act. First, Katelynn’s Principle was recommended by the jury. It’s clearly intended to cover the education system as well as the child welfare and youth justice systems.", "Also, I point to the final paragraph of the first jury recommendation, and it states: “Everyone who provides services to children or services that affect children are child advocates. Advocacy may potentially be a child’s lifeline. It must occur from the point of first contact and on a continual/continuous basis thereafter.” That paragraph isn’t included in the act, but as we try to do everything possible to make sure that no child falls through the cracks in the way that had such a tragic consequence for Katelynn Sampson, I think it’s an important piece of the principle.", "That is why, Speaker, I would like to see my private member’s bill, Bill 57, Katelynn’s Principle Act, be a companion piece of legislation to this bill. It has already passed second reading, so it should be relatively straightforward to make it happen.", "In terms of detail with the act, section 9 refers to the rights of communication. Written communication to and from a young person who is detained in a place of detention or custody cannot be opened, inspected or read if it is from their lawyer, the Office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, the Ombudsman, an MPP or an MP. However, the same restrictions do not apply for children in care. In their case, only communication to or from the young person’s lawyer may not be examined or read. I don’t understand why communication between a child in care and the provincial advocate, in particular, is not protected in the same way as it is for young people in custody.", "I also want to make a point here, Speaker, about clarity. I appreciate that some efforts have been made to make the language of the act more user-friendly, but I think perhaps people ran out of time on that particular part of the project. This section 9 that I referred to comes directly from the CFSA—basically, word for word—with a couple of small exceptions. Crown wards, by the way, are now called children in extended society care, and society wards are now called children in interim society care—small but good changes.", "Anyway, it is cumbersome language in the CFSA, and it remains cumbersome language today in the CYFSA. Let me give you an example of how it reads:", "“Written communications to and from a young person who is detained in a place of temporary detention or held in a place of secure custody or of open custody ...", "“(c) shall not be examined or read under clause (b) if it is to or from the young person’s lawyer; and", "“(d) shall not be opened and inspected under clause (a) or examined or read under clause (b) if it is to or from a person described in subclause (1) (b) (ii), (iii) or (iv).”", "There’s a lot more, but I just wanted to give you a flavour of it. This type of language is common throughout the act. In this case, it’s not too bad because the clauses and subclauses referred to are actually quite close together in the act. In other cases, you have to go searching through the act to find the related clauses and flip back and forth trying to make sense of it all. I know for the lawyers in this room, you are used to that. And for lawyers who work daily with the CFSA, it probably isn’t too challenging. Maybe it is; I don’t know. What I do know is that for people who cannot afford a lawyer, for people who have never looked at it before, it is hugely challenging to get your head around it.", "So, yes, I think that a lot more could be done to make the act more readable. Huge chunks of the CFSA have been simply dropped into the CYFSA with no thought as to how it might better serve children, youth and families. If there was a desire to respond to the Premier’s suggestion of blowing the whole thing up, it would appear that this has been a controlled explosion.", "Also, in this part relating to children’s and young persons’ rights, we have a section for complaints and reviews, but details are lacking. “A service provider who provides residential care ... shall establish a written procedure, in accordance with the regulations, for hearing and dealing with complaints ...”", "As in so many other cases, I guess we’ll have to wait and see what the regulations say. Maybe those regulations will provide for the written procedure to be published and made easily available to those who might need it. They should. Better yet, why not put those requirements right into this legislation?", "When the complaint is received, the service provider will do a review. Yes, that’s a good piece, but there is no time period for when the review should be done. I think we all know the frustrations that people feel when the wheels move slowly. It is particularly difficult for people living in challenging circumstances who wait and wait for action.", "If the person who makes the complaint isn’t satisfied with the result of the review, they can request a further review of the complaint by a person not employed by the service provider. That’s also good. Also good is that the further review will be done within 30 days. So if we can set a time limit for the further review, why can’t one be set for the initial review?", "Speaker, a significant change in this bill is that child protection will now be available to 16- and 17-year-olds. Currently, 16- and 17-year-olds can only access services if they have already been receiving services before they were 16. I’ve spoken in favour of increasing the age in the past, and I am in favour of it in this bill. It isn’t acceptable that we are simply turning our backs on 16- and 17-year-olds who need help and protection. As things stand, if a 16- or 17-year-old finds that they can no longer live at home, their only escape is to live on the street, and that is exactly what many of them do—escape to sleep in shop doorways, escape to destitution without money to buy coffee or a sandwich, and escape to the constant fear of who or what is around the next corner. That is no escape at all, but sadly, as it is, they find it better than the home they have left behind. So, yes, I fully support the extension of protection to 16- and 17-year-olds.", "In looking at the language of the act, though, I’m a bit confused as to how it will be interpreted. Others I have spoken to feel the same. Section 76 says:", "“(1) The society and a child who is 16 or 17 may make a written agreement for services and supports to be provided for the child where,", "“(a) the society has jurisdiction where the child resides;", "“(b) the society has determined that the child is or may be in need of protection;", "“(c) the society is satisfied that no course of action less disruptive to the child, such as care in the child’s own home or with a relative, neighbour or other member of the child’s community or extended family, is able to adequately protect the child; and", "“(d) the child wants to enter into the agreement.” So only if the child wants to enter into the agreement.", "But subsection 21(1) says, “A service provider may provide a service to a person who is 16 or older only with the person’s consent, except where the court orders under this act that the service be provided to the person.”", "Then there’s another subsection saying that this subsection “does not apply where a service is provided to a child under part V (Child Protection).” So which is it—only when the child wants it, or can the court order it?", "You will also note that in quoting section 76, I said that a written agreement may be made. I’ve been asked if that means that a society isn’t required to enter into an agreement even if all the conditions are met. I don’t know the answer to that, but it sounds like a very legitimate question.", "When it comes to 16- and 17-year-olds, there is no duty to report abuse or suspected abuse. I understand that there are different, competing rights and obligations that need to be considered for this age group. I get that, but I’m concerned that there is no duty to report. In many ways, they are at a very vulnerable age—susceptible, for example, to human trafficking. I think we need to give serious thought about how we’re going to best combat that.", "I’ve also heard concerns raised about what is intended with the new provision for the minister to be able to designate lead agencies. I’m sure that the minister has also been asked about this—and I have spoken with him about this, with no clarification. Lead agencies already exist in children’s mental health. They were put in place a couple of years ago. In 33 areas of the province, one agency has been identified as the lead agency for these areas. They are responsible for ensuring that core services are available in the community and for leading collaboration with other service providers in the area to work out the best way of delivering those services.", "I had a good meeting a couple of weeks ago with the executive director of Lynwood Charlton Centre, the lead agency in the Hamilton area. He’s pleased with what they have been able to do, even though they are having to do more with less. As I said earlier, children’s mental health is really struggling as demand for service grows while funding has basically flatlined. Agencies in Hamilton work collaboratively to make the best that they can of a very unfortunate situation. I’m pleased to say that the agencies in Hamilton have a history of working together to find arrangements that work best for children and youth living with mental health challenges. But Bill 89 doesn’t limit the lead agency model to the delivery of children’s mental health services. Many people are wondering what the government has in mind with this particular provision. Will the lead agency model be employed in the delivery of other services under the CYFSA? That is something that people would be very interested to know.", "Now I want to talk about accountability. As people will know, this is something that I’ve had a bit to say about in the past in this chamber. Twice I introduced a private member’s bill that would give oversight responsibility of children’s aid societies to the Ombudsman. Both times it passed second reading, but never made it to committee. Since then, the Public Sector and MPP Accountability and Transparency Act was passed, which gave oversight authority to the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth. This was welcome. However, I don’t think the powers given to the advocate match the powers that the Ombudsman would have had.", "I think there are still gaps in oversight that could be filled, but there is a major problem that has always been a complex mix of who can investigate what, what complaints are rightfully placed and who has the authority to correct a wrong. And that problem is still there. This is an ongoing problem with people unsure of the avenue to follow if they want to complain. The office of the advocate has tried to clarify these procedures on their website, but it’s not an easy job. So yes, I think we need to have a robust accountability framework—which this bill sets out to do—but I don’t think the government has got it right.", "Bill 89 allows for the minister to remove and appoint board members. The minister can designate a chair of the board or even appoint a supervisor to operate and manage the affairs and activities of the society. And when a supervisor is appointed, the society’s board ceases to exist. The supervisor has full control of this society. These are sweeping changes that give extraordinary power and authority to one person: the minister.", "Yes, we need to have accountability, especially with agencies that are government-funded—to the tune of, what is it, $1.5 billion?—and are given the responsibility to protect some of Ontario’s most vulnerable children and youth. Most definitely we need accountability, but is this the best way that the government could come up with to achieve that, by giving so much power to one person?", "I wish I had faith in that power, that it would always be exerted in the best interest of children and youth, but I’m sorry, Speaker: History has shown us that this government does not always act in the best interests of anyone but themselves. And if you want to take issue with that, I ask you to think of the future and all the possible Ministers of Children and Youth Services in years to come. Do you really want to give such sweeping powers to one person? There need to be some checks and balances built into this to ensure that power and authority isn’t abused with self-serving politics, that it doesn’t get in the way of making the best decision for our children and youth.", "An important part of this act is its recognition of the unique challenges faced by First Nations, Inuit and Métis people. It strives to work within a framework that recognizes—let’s go back to the quote from the preamble: “First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples are constitutionally recognized peoples in Canada, with their own laws, and distinct cultural, political and historical ties to the province of Ontario.”", "You can say that and then, given the colonial history of our province, the effects of which we have heard so much about through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the damage done because we supposedly knew what was best for indigenous peoples—in the face of all of that, you think it’s okay to say, “Oh, by the way, if I don’t like what you’re doing, I’m going to pick someone to take over your agency”—really? Not even a mention about how such a person would be picked.", "The minister will also have the power to amalgamate societies, a significant power. That would have quite an impact on some communities, but it can be done with the stroke of a pen.", "When that happens, when the minister dictates from on high that two or more societies will be amalgamated—that’s right, there’s no limit as to how many can be amalgamated into one—the minister has to give written notice to each affected society. The societies then have the right to respond. That’s also true when the minister exerts those other powers, such as appointing a supervisor. But there’s only a requirement that the society be given notice and a right to respond. Nowhere is there a requirement that either the minister or the society be required to inform the general public or the workers or their union on the decision to amalgamate and give them the right to respond as well. It seems to me that the public and the workers who will be most affected in this type of situation deserve to know what’s happening, why it’s happening, and to have the right to provide input.", "While we’re on the subject of society boards, let me talk a little bit about the makeup of boards. Section 35 says: “A society that provides services to First Nations, Inuit or Métis children and families shall have the prescribed number of First Nations, Inuit or Métis representatives on its board of directors, appointed in the prescribed manner and for the prescribed terms.” The drafters certainly like that word, “prescribed,” as you will have heard, Speaker, but we’ll leave that alone again for now. That’s a good section to see. It might be better if I had a sense of just how much influence those board members might have in the term of numbers, but it’s good to see there. I wonder why we’re stopping there, though, Speaker. Wherever we have boards making decisions for communities, those boards should include people chosen directly from those that they serve. There should be certainly a representation from any group that is overrepresented in a system.", "The One Vision One Voice project brought together people who knew the child welfare sector and also knew the African Canadian community. They consulted with people from that community with a view to, as the subtitle of the project says, “changing the Ontario child welfare system to better serve African Canadians.” Speaker, in the report you will read that while only 8.5% of Toronto’s population is African Canadian, over 40% of children in care are from that community. These figures, by the way, come from the Toronto Children’s Aid Society. But in general, we know nothing about who is in the child welfare system because we don’t collect data. We can come back to data collection a little bit later too. You will also read that African Canadians report that they get treated differently than their white counterparts when they are entered into the child welfare system. They don’t have access to culturally appropriate services, and they have poorer outcomes. The report talks about “the racism within the system and the larger society that created the racial disproportionality.”", "This project was funded by the Ministry of Children and Youth and carried out through the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies. It is an important piece of work that offers a number of recommendations, but I do not see any of that work reflected here in this act.", "One small step would be to legislate that boards be representative of the people that they serve. What about including youth in care or former youth in care? We do it with school boards: We have student trustees. Why don’t we do it in child welfare? Katelynn’s Principle: Youth, working with the provincial advocate’s office, presented it to the coroner’s inquest and it became the guiding principle of this act. If they can do that, just think what they could bring to board tables all across Ontario.", "Include families who have used the services of children’s aid societies on their boards, and, for all of those people, provide them support that will fully allow them to participate in the functioning of boards. Often, people who volunteer their time to sit on community boards are people who feel comfortable in that type of setting. They’re used to sitting around a table, hearing reports and providing input. That’s not always the case with youth and families who have received child welfare services. Many of them will have never been in that type of setting. We need to make boards more accessible to them because there is no substitute for lived experience. Require boards to include those people served by the system and provide support so they can participate to their full potential. So much could be achieved if we gave those people a voice and respected what they had to say.", "As I work my way through the bill, I want to briefly touch on an example of a key problem identified earlier: the problem that Katelynn’s Principle doesn’t come through in the actual language of the act.", "This is in relation to residential placement advisory committees. First of all, the minister may establish residential placement advisory committees—not “will” or “shall”; the minister might, if he feels inclined. The section goes on to outline the duties of the RPAC, which include this: “An advisory committee shall conduct a review under this section in an informal manner and in the absence of the public, and ... may,", "“(a) interview the child, members of the child’s family and any representatives of the child and family....”", "A child has the right to express their views freely, a right to be engaged, a right to be consulted, a right to raise concerns, and a right to be informed. But when it comes to the actual language of the act, the legal part, the advisory committee can decide whether or not they speak to a child. In other words, it doesn’t matter what their rights are; there is no legal obligation to do it.", "Moving on, Speaker, let me talk a little bit about solitary confinement, or, as it is in the existing CFSA, secure isolation. In 2015, the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth did a systemic review of secure isolation in Ontario. In commenting on his resulting report, which is called It’s a Matter of Time, he said this: “Youth justice custody is supposed to give young people the opportunities for rehabilitation so they can turn their lives around and later reintegrate into society. Solitary confinement runs counter to this model since it negatively harms an individual’s mental and physical health, especially those with mental health issues.”", "In particular, he called for a complete ban on putting youth in solitary confinement for more than 24 hours, which would bring Ontario in line with international standards.", "In response to the report, the Premier said, “The advocate has done his job and has shone a light on some issues that of course we’re concerned about and that we will need to work with him to rectify, absolutely.” Clearly something would be done in the new act when it was written. And it was. Secure isolation would now be called secure de-escalation. That’s it. No other changes to the language in the act regarding the use of de-escalation—changed the name. There’s a recognized problem, and the only thing that they can come up with to fix it is to change the name.", "Speaker, I’m not saying that words aren’t important, because they are. I support the various points where the language has been modernized in Bill 89, but there is much more that needs to be done than that.", "In the CYFSA, as in the CFSA, there are provisions that say that a child or young person who is put in secure de-escalation must be continuously observed. It is also not legal to hold them there for more than eight hours in a 24-hour period and not more than 24 hours in a week.", "Those provisions don’t apply to a person who is 16 or older. Instead, there will be other standards and procedures to be followed that will be prescribed. There we go—more lack of detail. We don’t know what those standards and procedures will be because they are not yet written, or if they are, nobody gets to see them.", "Mechanical restraints are not referred to in the existing CFSA, but they do get a mention in the CYFSA. Their use is banned under the CYFSA, with the exception that they can be used in a secure facility in youth corrections or under “Extraordinary Measures,” part VII of the act.", "The problem here is that the conditions that say when they can and will be used will be set in regulations, and policies will be based on those regulations.", "While we are talking about youth in corrections, it would be remiss of me not to mention OPSEU’s “Apples to Apples” campaign. At the core of this campaign, if you’ll excuse the pun, is the disparity between the two systems within youth corrections. One is the Ontario public service and one is the broader public service. These two systems are both funded by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services, and they serve the same youth. The Youth Justice Services Manual has two sets of regulations: one for OPS and one for BPS. There are consistent standards within the OPS, but in the BPS, I understand the different standards can be applied at the discretion of the agencies. Pay is lower in the BPS, and while all workers in the OPS facilities are covered by WSIB, there is no mandated WSIB coverage for those in the BPS. This makes no sense, Speaker.", "Standards of service and conditions of employment should be consistent across the entire youth corrections sector. Because Young People Matter, the report of the Residential Services Review Panel, agreed. In their report, they stated: “The ministry continues to operate the two legacy systems in secure custody and detention as two ... distinct service delivery systems, with inconsistent standards for the hiring, training and compensation of staff, or practice between the two systems.... An integration of the two systems into one harmonized system could bring the full resources of both systems together to enhance opportunities to meet the needs of young people in secure detention and custody.”", "So I would say that the rewriting of this act was an opportunity missed to make some significant changes, and this would have been one of them.", "I think there were also opportunities missed with respect to the residential licensing.", "Flowing from the report of the Residential Services Review Panel—I think the ministry heard some serious concerns raised in that report. They certainly mentioned some of them in the briefing that I received; for example,", "—limited quality standards;", "—licensing and compliance information not being shared publicly;", "—limited authority to conduct unannounced inspections.", "There is a new section in the CYFSA addressing residential licensing inspections, but I think it lacks what the authors of the report were looking for. The greatest concern is that the inspection process doesn’t focus on the most important aspect: the quality of services being delivered. The panel called for inspection processes that specifically evaluate the quality of care offered to children and youth. I’ve heard that inspection reports can include items such as the colour of a bathtub or a bruised apple being in a bowl on the table, but at the same time lack reference to the quality of services being provided.", "Going back to the central theme of my thoughts on this bill, an inspector “may” question a child on matters relevant to an inspection. There’s no requirement to speak to the child and young person. They might do it if they feel like it, I guess. The child does have the right to refuse to be questioned by the inspector, as they should, but why doesn’t the act require the inspector to at least make the approach? Why not take it a little bit further? Why would there be no requirement that children and young people in a residence are informed that an inspector is on the premises and available for them to speak to in confidence? The reason for that might be because of concerns the inspector isn’t qualified to have that conversation. I suppose under this act it would be understandable, because there is nothing in the act that speaks to the qualifications of an inspector, which is another problem. In this bill, there are no requirements of inspectors that identify their expertise in social services or in conducting inspections.", "The Ontario Association of Residences Treating Youth, OARTY, points to the fact that residential licensing was and remains facility- or building-focused rather than being focused on the child. They see in the CYFSA a missed opportunity to reimagine the residential services sector and write legislation that allowed for innovation and forward-thinking improvements. As they say—and I believe this is in keeping with Katelynn’s Principle—the structure, both licensing and funding, needs to follow the child, not the bed.", "Concerns about qualifications go beyond inspectors, as well. Let’s remember that those who work in children’s residences are often required to provide treatment to young people with complex mental health concerns. They can have deep depression, they can be suicidal, and the abuse and neglect that they have suffered can cause horrendous trauma. Yet there are no requirements that staff be trained to work in that setting. I find it incredible that this government has allowed this to continue. Staff should be qualified to do the job we need them to do if our residential system is to succeed.", "Now a bit about personal information: Standards need to be set, and there needs to be a program in place that allows existing staff to meet those standards within a period of time and that they are not expected to pay for. Concerns have been raised over the years about the lack of data, sharing of information and access to files in our child welfare system. Without data we have no idea who is in our system. We don’t know for sure what groups of children and youth are overrepresented, we can’t measure the success of programs, and we can’t plan or direct services where they are most needed. We saw in the Katelynn Sampson case what can happen when information isn’t shared. The jury gave four recommendations on information sharing alone. It has been a long-standing concern that individuals do not have a right to access their own personal information that is in the hands of the ministry service providers, so I am pleased to see part X of the CYFSA devoted to this.", "First, I would like to say how important it is that people will now be entitled to access their personal files. But with regard to the collection of data, right off the bat the minister is given an out. The first line under the minister’s power to collect, use and disclose personal information says—wait for it—“The minister may collect personal information.”", "Where is the responsibility to do it? Why is there power but no responsibility? As I’ve said, there is a common theme throughout this act. It is important that we make data and information work to the benefit of children and youth, but we must also remember that this information is highly sensitive and people have a right to their privacy. I recognize that this is a challenging line to walk, but the government must meet this challenge.", "I would say that there are at least a couple of sections that cause me some concern in this regard.", "Section 300 says, “A service provider shall take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is not collected without authority.”", "Section 302 says, “(1) A service provider,", "“(a) shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the records of personal information that has been collected for the purpose of providing a service and that are in its custody or control are retained, transferred and disposed of in a secure manner.”", "Why “reasonable steps”? Why not just say, “Don’t do it”? To take reasonable steps to not do something you aren’t authorized to do is like saying that we should all take reasonable steps to drive within the speed limit.", "When we talk about data collection and information sharing, it’s impossible to not talk about CPIN, the Child Protection Information Network. CPIN is slowly rolling out to children’s aid societies across Ontario, a process that won’t be completed until 2020. The minister tells me that all is going well, but that’s not what I hear from front-line workers who have to work with it. The concerns sound very similar to the related program, SAMS, that is used in our social assistance system. Members will know about the problems with SAMS; it has made front-page news on a number of occasions.", "Those working with CPIN say that it is taking much longer to get problems fixed. Endless hours are spent trying to find data that is supposed to be in there. On occasion, children who are in the system cannot be found on CPIN. These problems can have very serious consequences for vulnerable children and youth. CPIN is causing high stress in the workplace for those working with it and is putting added stress on the budgets of agencies that are already stretched, I’d have to say, way past their limit. Each agency is given $220,000 to pay for the transition to CPIN, but that is only a fraction of what it’s costing agencies, especially ones with larger caseloads. There are high hopes for what CPIN will eventually be able to do, but we are a long way from that, and there is a lot of work to do.", "Speaker, I am running out of time here, so just let me say that it’s important that this bill gets to committee and that enough time is provided to hear from experts in the field: those who use the system, those who work in it and those who have studied it. I know they have a lot to say and have many suggestions for how the CYFSA can be improved to better serve Ontario’s children, youth and their families.", "In years to come, there will undoubtedly be a need to continue to update the act to ensure it meets our needs. Currently, there is a mandated review of the act every five years, a mandate that continues in the CYFSA.", "The concerns I have laid out in the last hour I think reflect the size of the task at hand. A complete rewrite of the CFSA was always going to be a daunting task, taking into consideration not only the mandated review but the other reports that have been prepared over the past number of years. Looking to the future, perhaps it’s time to consider an ongoing review. In BC, for example, which also has a five-year review, there is an all-party Select Standing Committee on Children and Youth that meets on a regular basis.", "Protecting vulnerable children and youth from harm, providing the services they need to allow them to meet their full potential, is perhaps the most important thing a government can do. It isn’t just the right thing to do. Investment in their future is an investment for us all.", "As I’ve said throughout, the lack of detail is concerning. The reliance on yet unknown regulations makes it very difficult to offer an adequate evaluation. In many areas, the language could have been a lot more robust in a way that requires action to be taken rather than suggesting that it could be taken. I’ve offered a few examples of each of these concerns, but there are many, many more.", "Finally, if this CYFSA is going to do what the minister says he wants it to do, the funding will need to be in place to put it back to where it needs to be. There is already inadequate funding and it is impossible to do more with less." ],

It increases the age of protection to include all 16- and 17-year-olds.", "It affirms the rights of children, acknowledges the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and sets clear expectations for service providers as to how they should work with children, youth and families.", "If passed, the act would strengthen the child welfare and child and family services system by strengthening the ministry’s ability to hold children’s aid societies accountable for the services they provide. In particular, it would strengthen the ministry’s ability to hold CASs accountable for the management of the public funds with which they are entrusted. Specifically, it would support First Nation, Métis and Inuit children, youth and families through the delivery of culturally appropriate supports that respect indigenous cultures, heritages and traditions.", "An issue has been raised in the comments already this afternoon around this whole issue of amalgamating children’s aid societies, and I think maybe we should spend a few minutes on that. Currently, there are 47 children’s aid societies across Ontario, including nine indigenous child well-being societies. Since 2011, 16 such societies have voluntarily amalgamated to form seven new societies. We’ve obviously been tracking what has happened with the amalgamated societies to review and monitor their performance, and what we’ve seen is that all of the amalgamated societies have been able to operate within their approved budget allocations or, in some cases, even generate surpluses.", "We’ve also seen that amalgamations support more consistent service delivery and access to high-quality services regardless of where a child, youth or family resides in the province. I know I have, in my constituency office in Guelph, had people come in to talk to me about how they maybe had interaction with a children’s aid society in a different jurisdiction—the one that we share, Guelph and Wellington—and that there are differences in the details of the service provision from area to area within the province. What we do see with amalgamation is that it supports a more consistent service delivery and access to high-quality services, regardless of where a child, youth or family resides.", "The proposed legislation would give the minister the authority to compel two or more children’s aid societies to amalgamate when it is in the public’s interest to do so. However, it is really important to emphasize that no decisions have been made on any society amalgamations at this time. In fact, I’m sure that the minister would be looking at, when it is in the public interest, what the consequences of that would be. But the minister would have that authority going forward.", "One of the things that I am really excited about is raising the age of protection. If you think about the model on which the original act was structured, we’re talking about a time when it was quite typical for children and youth to leave school at 16, when the legal school-leaving age was 16. Because 16 was the sort of notional transition to a job and adulthood, that’s what the act says. But of course, that’s no longer true. The school-leaving age has been raised; clearly, most students are not leaving school now at 16, and there’s a misfit now between the way modern society works and what the act says.", "So we’re going to raise the age of protection to include all 16- and 17-year-olds. If the act is passed, we expect to proclaim that provision around raising the age of protection starting in September 2017. While it’s difficult to get an exact handle on it, we anticipate that up to 1,600 youth will benefit from raising the age of protection by the end of the first year of implementation alone.", "What that means is that 16- and 17-year-olds will have access to child protection services, including services through a voluntary agreement with a children’s aid society. So, if passed, these provisions would bring Ontario in line with other provinces and territories as the eighth province to raise the age of protection. As I say, given my past experience as a school board trustee and working with the local family and children’s services agency, which is what children’s aid is called in our jurisdiction, the disconnect you get with the old rules is very problematic, and I’m pleased that this will change.", "One of the other things I want to mention very quickly is that the legislation will also provide children, youth and families with the right to access information in the files about them—because historically it has been a problem for families to get access to information about their own children, and for youth to get access to the information that is in their own file—and to make it easier for one service to communicate with another service and share information. That freeing-up of information sharing, both with families and other agencies, will improve the service that children and youth are receiving.", "I’m very excited about this bill.

Speaker, when I started off my nursing career many decades ago, I was at the Hospital for Sick Children, now known as SickKids. That was where some of my initial contacts were with children who needed protection of family and children services. I worked very closely with them. I was on an infant medical floor, and many of the children who came in were victims of neglect and abuse, so I was very involved with many of the multidisciplinary teams. We spent much time together to sort out some of the issues.", "I know with that background that the welfare of our children in the province of Ontario has always been of very personal importance to me, as it is to probably every single member in this House. I don’t think we can argue that.", "One of the things that I’m very excited about is the increase of the age of protection to include all 16- and 17-year-olds. Certainly with the number of children I’ve raised in my own family, I’ve had the odd occasion where one of my children will come home and say a 16-year-old or a 17-year-old friend has been kicked out of their home with nowhere to go. We’ve been able to provide some protection for a little while at our home until we got services organized or until they were able to work out some of the issues they had in their family.", "I know with this legislation that, if passed, we expect to proclaim the provisions related to the age of protection starting this September, and it can’t come soon enough as far as I’m concerned.", "As has been mentioned, we anticipate that up to 1,600 youth will benefit from raising the age of protection by the end of the first year of implementation, and 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds will have access to child protection services, including services through a voluntary agreement with a children’s aid society.", "This last weekend, I participated in a fundraiser for Argus Residence, in my home riding of Cambridge, who provide services for homeless youth starting around ages 16 and 17, leading up to when they’re young adults. This is an incredible organization, Speaker. Not only did they provide a safe, secure residence for those youth, but they offer so many more services to be able to try and get those youth forward in their schooling, trying to teach them job skills and giving them a place of security that they could develop these skills.", "One example they told us about during the fundraiser this past weekend is a store called Uptown Thrift. Each and every year they are able to provide employment for 24 to 25 of their youth in residence, to be able to help them secure a job and have that experience for the future.", "We all understand how important it is for our 16- and 17-year-olds to be able to have the support system, to be able to deal with some of their issues, to be able to go back to school, to address issues at home and have the support services that they need to be able to move forward and get the most out of their life.", "I’m proud that these provisions will bring Ontario in line with other provinces and territories, as the eighth province to raise the age of protection. The proposed changes aim to help young people by extending their access to child protection services so that they have better outcomes as they transition into adulthood. I can’t be more in support of this. As I said, I’ve had long experience with children in protection through my various roles in the community, so I know how important this is. I’m pretty sure that we will see a lot of support amongst our members here in the House.", "The other thing I really wanted to mention today was how this legislation affects adoptions. Again, many, many families want to open their doors, their homes and their hearts to having a child find stability through permanent homes and relationships that are meaningful to them. Recently, a couple of friends of mine in my community took on the role of adopting with two sisters that were aged six and eight, so a little older. They were able to then have that adoption pass by. Now, my friends are their permanent parents and their forever home. It has worked really well, and I really wanted to talk about them for a moment in the context of what this legislation would provide.", "This legislation would give the children who are being adopted a stronger voice in decisions being made about their relationships with birth families and others who are important to them post-adoption. The two girls that I’ve referenced had this opportunity through a very nicely put out agreement with the forever parents and the birth parents. I know now they’ve been with their adoptive parents for three years. They have a long-standing agreement with the birth parents which is working very well. All parties agreed to it. The girls have benefited from seeing their birth mother every so often and other members of that family. My friends have gone out of their way to ensure that those relationships are supported and looked after. The girls themselves have transitioned well because they have had that voice in saying what their future is.", "In addition, we’re currently conducting a review of the adoption service delivery system, which will consider the option of centralizing adoption services in Ontario. The report and recommendations of this review are expected in the spring of 2017. I think that we all look forward to seeing those pieces. Our goal is to dramatically improve the delivery of adoption services in Ontario.", "Lastly, I really just want to provide my great support to ensuring that this bill moves forward, so we can see more 16- and 17-year-olds under the age of protection." ],

I want to address a number of issues that have arisen, in part by the previous speakers.", "First off, this bill was occasioned by the Auditor General’s 2015 report. I sit on the public accounts committee and had a chance to review the auditor’s findings. It was very clear that the children’s aid societies and the provision of youth services could be done a lot more efficiently. We’re taking on the recommendations made by the Auditor General at the time, and we’re encompassing so many of those recommendations into this bill. We’ve also done extensive consultations across children’s aid societies, the general public and youth justice workers in order to bring this bill, a very comprehensive piece of legislation, forward.", "One area I’m particularly interested in is the whole Child Protection Information Network. It has been in development for a number of years, but now it’s being formalized in this bill and there is some more rigour being put into the development of our Child Protection Information Network. It is primarily designed, of course, so that kids don’t fall through cracks, as sometimes does happen. This will allow all children’s aid societies across the province to put information under a centralized database with protections in place to protect privacy but also to give greater access to information between agencies. Between the police and children aid societies and parents, they can access this crucial information to make sure young people are being treated appropriately.", "There was tremendous consultation in the development of this process across the ministry. Front-line workers and union representatives: They all came to the table for input. They continue to work with stakeholders to improve front-line staff experience with the CPIN program. There have been something in the order of 80 enhancements since it was first introduced in 2014—80 enhancements to that program to make it work seamlessly, and better. That’s been an incredible boost.", "I want to talk a little bit about the impact on youth justice services. I had the pleasure, last Friday, of going to visit an organization called Boost Child and Youth Advocacy Centre. This is an extraordinary agency in downtown Toronto that looks after youth who have been sexually abused, who have been trafficked, who are addicted and who need help. They see people in that organization as young as 12. Extending the age to 16 and 17 so that they can continue to capture this within the child advocacy system is extraordinary important.", "I met a constituent, actually—she came to my East York Memorial skating party a couple of weeks ago and was telling me about this incredible organization, and I wanted to go down and see it. They have under one roof wraparound services of intake workers, where the police can bring someone to a safer zone where they can interview a child who has been abused or is undergoing incredible trauma in their life, where you have the police, the children’s aid society, psychologists, therapists and intake workers who can provide case management and a friendly face that a child can be comfortable with, and help them through and help the families through what are always very traumatic experiences.", "So I met a constituent, Nancy Cottenden, and she invited me to come down. I visited on Friday and met the president and CEO, Karyn Kennedy. It’s extraordinary work that they’re doing down there. I had the tour; Lindsay Jolie gave me a tour of the facility, and I was just amazed at the incredible outcomes that they’re able to assist with.", "They are a piece of the puzzle in youth protection and youth justice services. I have a very good friend, Cheryl Milne, who used to be counsel for Justice for Children and Youth. Cheryl for years has been working diligently in this sector, representing young kids, young adults—15, 16, 17 years old, helping them to exercise their rights within the system with regard to their parental, their schooling, and assisting them. Cheryl is now at the University of Toronto in the constitutional centre, but I had an opportunity to go and meet the people from Justice for Children and Youth at a number of fundraisers I’ve attended and get a better sense of how they are great advocates and can work with an agency like Boost to ensure children are kept safe, don’t fall through the cracks and remain healthy in our society.", "I also wanted to briefly touch on the adoption issue. I think this is absolutely critical, the new work we’re doing in the adoption sector. We are under review, but this legislation will create more mechanisms so that adoptive services can be more responsive, more transparent and more fair.", "I’ve had a number of constituents come to talk to me in the past about how outdated some of the rules around adoption have been. For instance, it’s very difficult to do interracial adoptions in the province of Ontario. It’s frowned upon. I have families who want to get a person of colour adopted into their family, but they were finding difficulties and restrictions for it. It might be just one children’s aid society, but it’s something that needs to be modernized. We need to have equitable experiences across the province of Ontario so that kids can find a way into a home and be able to deal, in future life, with their birth parents in a productive way, both for the needs they may have for medical records, but also to get to know them.", "Thank you very much, Speaker.

We had Bruce children’s aid and Grey children’s aid; they amalgamated in the past. It’s quite an arduous process, as you can imagine, to bring two large organizations together, to do all of that transition and to come out the other end. I think that went very well. We met with the executive director, Phyllis Lovell, and the past chairperson, Gary Harron. I know the amount of work they spent to get this and to do it, with all of the focus remaining on the children and the services for children.", "They’re concerned about a broader amalgamation just for the sake of amalgamation, perhaps to save money because of all of the waste and mismanagement of this Liberal government. That takes away from the children.", "I was critic three years ago, and they raised the issue of board liability. Volunteers are actually on the hook—the only board, I believe, that is a volunteer board, in all the province, that is on the hook for liability in regard to the budget. That, then, limits who will come forward, the people who are able to volunteer to these. As we all know, volunteers provide so much to our province. Those are things that, again, we were hoping for in this bill, and hopefully during committee we can speak about those and make sure we find ways to improve those systems.", "The other one is budget limitations. What I’m hearing from a lot of people is that the roles are not being filled if there are stress leaves, if there are people who are retiring. They’re trying, in many cases, to save money, to get to that balanced budget, by not filling in. Speaker, the same number of kids are there, the same name of children in need are there, and yet people are now doubling and tripling up on their workload. Just recently, folks were in from Nipissing and Parry Sound who are locked out currently, and they gave me examples of that: that right now—they have been out for a long time—those kids are the ones who are suffering.", "Hopefully, through this and in my next 20 minutes, I’ll talk to some of these issues and find ways that we can improve this legislation, with the focus always being the children at the front line and the programs and services they receive." ],

I have so many thoughts on this, and I’m looking forward to having my time later during debate to really have a fulsome conversation. Of course, I do have some initial thoughts based on what we have heard.", "The member opposite talked about this being a comprehensive bill and hopes that it would make things more efficient. I’d caution the member that efficiency sounds great, but if their goal is to speed this through the process without putting appropriate safeguards in, or just leaving everything to regulation—“Well, let’s get it through quickly, but don’t worry, we’ll figure it all out later”—that’s problematic. We’re talking about children, youth and families in this bill, and we want to ensure that they are getting the best protections and services, of course, that they deserve, that they should have.", "We had heard earlier in the conversation about sweeping powers being given to ministers down the road, whoever they may be, and giving them powers without the responsibility—that they may do this, they may do that, they can do this, but where does it say that they have to do this? Where is the action piece? It’s giving them the power without the responsibility to protect the children in question, to best serve families.", "We heard about reviews, but again, without that time period—again, back to efficiency. We don’t want rush. We want what is appropriate here: the best service for families and children.", "Man, time goes by. I’m looking forward to my 20 minutes because I really want to delve into this, especially when it comes to 16- and 17-year-olds and making sure that they are under the care umbrella in the way that best serves them." ],

It will increase, as we’ve already spoken about, to children who are 16 and 17 years old.", "If we look at just the specific piece on youth identity, the member of the opposition from, I believe, Thornhill had some concerns about that piece within the bill. She said that many community organizations are raising concerns about this specific aspect, and she’s concerned that the Liberal government hasn’t done enough to address communities’ concerns. But the member didn’t actually specify what the concerns were, so I would be interested in hearing a little bit more about that.", "Bill 89 includes a range of aspects of a child’s unique identity which must be weighed when providing services to that child. The aspects include race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, family diversity, disability, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. If there isn’t another way that we can focus on a child’s interests and a child’s identity—it is laid out in that piece of the legislation in particular.

We’re the only jurisdiction left in Canada that does not protect children up to the age of 18.", "I have trouble getting my head around defining someone up to age 18, defining a 17-year-old, for example, as a child.

Number one is raising the protection from 16 to 18 for those more vulnerable children in unsafe living conditions, to support them in education, and to reduce homelessness and human trafficking. The second goal is strengthening the focus on early intervention, helping to prevent children and families from reaching crisis situations in the home. Number three, and this has been mentioned a number of times, is making services more culturally appropriate for all children—and youth, I might mention: “Youth” is right in the title of this bill, in case anybody missed that—including indigenous children, black children, youth, to help ensure they receive the best possible support. And number four is improving oversight of service providers, including children’s aid societies, so that children and youth receive consistent, high-quality services across the province.", "Again, I think what’s very important is raising that age of protection—it’s too bad it has taken this long—up to just short of age 18.", "The second point, early intervention, is a good concept if it’s done in the right way. We don’t need any heavy-handedness on behalf of a children’s aid officer. Over the years, I’ve had a number of complaints to my office about the children’s aid service. I think we’ve all heard many of these stories.", "The third point: I am surprised there would be a need to make the services more culturally appropriate. I think that’s already a law. All children, obviously, should be treated equally regardless of colour, race or religion.", "The fourth point, on oversight: I’ve sat through a number of meetings with constituents. I’ve listened to stories of alleged unfair investigations from the children’s aid society. In many cases I am hearing one side of the story. I meet regularly with our local Haldimand–Norfolk children’s aid service to get that balance.", "Obviously, we have to get the children out of the worst homes, but at the same time, realizing that assisting for young people to stay in the home and to stay with the family is, in my view, anyway, that’s the ideal situation. The state can’t handle everything.", "But I do get pressure. I do hear from people. They want their kids back. Over the years, they’ve demonstrated out in front of my office. They’ve demonstrated in downtown Simcoe, where my office is located, at the corner of Norfolk and Robinson, the main intersection.", "To get back to some of the reasons for these problems, many of the calls may be the result of separated or divorced parents, for example, trying to cause trouble for the other spouse by phoning children’s aid with these allegations. Children’s aid has a mandate to investigate, but in the absence of any evidence, they question the need to continually investigate when you know that the parents are hostile to each other. Under law, it’s a crime to make a false statement to the police or to the courts, but myself and my staff feel that there are false statements being made to the children’s aid societies, so we’ve got to have a balance and get the children out of hostile situations.", "Having said that, I do give credit to my local Haldimand–Norfolk children’s aid society, its employees and the volunteer board. I attend the annual meeting. I have meetings in my office as well.", "I’ll mention, as well, that just on the weekend, I ran into a former MPP in my riding, Gord Miller. He’s 92. As I recall, Gord was on the children’s aid society board, I think, when I was first elected.", "So, Speaker, here it is. I don’t mean to hold this up as a prop. It is 270 pages, this proposed legislation, Bill 89, An Act to enact the Child, Youth and Family Services Act, 2016, to amend and repeal the Child and Family Services Act and to make related amendments to other Acts. That was put right in the title, and I can understand why, because there are something like 36 amendments in here to other pieces of legislation. I admit I have not gone through all 270 pages.", "I’d ask everyone present to turn to part I, section 1(1). The purpose of the act: “To promote the best interests, protection and well-being of children.” It’s kind of too bad we can’t leave it at that. We do have to have another 270 pages and so many additional clauses.", "It’s again important, and I think this bears repeating—it was presented just a few minutes ago; this would be part I, section 1(1)(iii)—to take into account “a child’s or young person’s race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, family diversity, disability, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression”—and that phrase alone has generated a fair bit of input into my office, and a number of letters and emails.", "The legislation addresses issues with respect to First Nations, Inuit and Métis people, again to recognize culture, heritage, traditions, connection to their communities, and the concept of “extended family.”", "I was really intrigued to read this. I guess I didn’t have too much to do on the weekend. I spent my time reading Bill 89.", "“Extended family” with respect to native people means a person to whom a child is related, including spousal relation, adoption, and, in the case of First Nations and Inuit—now, this says I-N-U-K. It’s important to read the legislation. I just found a spelling mistake in this legislation. I do want to point that out.", "Where was I? The extended family of a First Nations child, or an Inuk—which I think should read “Inuit”—or a Métis child includes any member of a band of which the child is a member.", "Down my way, we have Six Nations. My riding is south of Hamilton and Brantford. Six Nations is the largest native community in Canada. I’m not sure if it’s 25,000 or 30,000. It’s the largest community down our way. The extended family, as I assume, reading this legislation, would include all 25,000 people of the membership of Six Nations.", "We have a smaller community right next door, the Mississaugas of the New Credit.", "Something just came up. In the title, we’re talking about “child” and “youth.” The legislation talks about a “young person.” I was surprised to see the definition of a “young person.” For the purposes of this legislation, a “young person” means “a person who is or, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, appears to be 12 or older but younger than 18 and who is charged with or found guilty of an offence under the Youth Criminal Justice Act (Canada) or the Provincial Offences Act.”", "When I think of young people, I don’t limit them just to their rap sheet. I just think it’s important to know what some of these definitions say.", "Again, there is an interpretation of the word “parent”:", "“(2) Unless this act provides otherwise, a reference in this act to a parent of a child is deemed to be a reference to,", "“(a) the person who has lawful custody of the child”—and it goes on and on about lawful custody. I never really thought about my mom that way, but that’s the definition of a “parent” in this legislation.", "One last thing I’ll mention: Under “communication,” a child in care has a right to speak in private with, or to visit or receive visits—this brings it kind of close to home; there’s a list here—from “(iv) a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario or of the Parliament of Canada;”", "If we are talking to these children, I’m not saying to try and wade through all 270 pages—I clearly didn’t—but it’s important to know what’s in this legislation. I think it’s important.", "For the record, I’ll ask that that spelling mistake be corrected in this legislation.", "I mentioned the interest in my riding with respect to this piece of proposed legislation. This is our job, as MPPs, to not only read the legislation and talk about it in here, but we have to talk to the people who have elected us. There can’t be room for error on this, and there can’t be misunderstandings.", "I received a letter—a number of letters, actually. This is from one of my constituents from Dunnville. It starts out:", "“Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I really appreciate it.", "“Bill 89 in Ontario will replace the Child and Family Services Act by changing the matters to be considered in determining the best interests of a child. It removes ‘the religious faith, if any, in which the child is being raised,’ and adds”—and we’ve heard this a number of times—“the following long and confusing list: ‘race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, family diversity, disability, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.’”", "I will point out that my definition of “creed” is really—well, I think of the Apostles’ Creed, for example, of my church. It’s kind of a litany or a rendition of the core principles of the religion. “Creed” or “religion”—I consider that kind of the same word.", "My constituent goes on to say, “There is a potentially dangerous ramification from this change: The children of parents who refuse to affirm ‘progressive’ gender ideology may be more likely to be considered ‘in need of protection.’”", "It goes on to say, “Under the act, a child suffering or ‘at risk of suffering’ mental or emotional harm and whose parents do not provide ‘treatment or access to treatment’ is a child in need of protection under the law. The children’s aid society must investigate evidence that children may be in need of protection, and a court can make orders governing the care of children deemed to be in need of protection.”", "This letter goes on and on in this vein. It’s something that we all have to consider.", "My constituent concludes in the letter, “This bill is ideological and puts family integrity at risk.”", "I’ll leave my constituent’s concerns to this body and for others to deliberate. I will forward this letter, and so many other letters that have come in, to the minister responsible, for a reply.", "We know that with respect to our children’s aids—and I think of my local one—they really got hit a few years ago on the financial front. There was a four- or five-year clampdown on money allocated to our local Haldimand–Norfolk children’s aid. They were forced to make some pretty dramatic cutbacks, primarily, as I recall, in that age group of 16, 17, and 18, who wanted to perhaps continue their studies in school but didn’t have the money.", "As I recall, under part III in the bill, Funding and Accountability, it comes up with some ways to make some administrative savings. As we know, it provides the legal authority to compel amalgamations and dissolutions of societies when it is in the public interest to do so.", "That was quite a debate locally, about a year ago, with our children’s aid. I certainly raised it at the annual meeting at that time. We got wind of it back then.", "Can transfer all or any part of a society’s operations; can appoint and replace a minority of the board, and appoint a supervisor—we just saw that happen with the Ontario Processing Vegetable Growers association on Friday, where the minister responsible pretty well disbanded the board and brought in a supervisor.", "The minister can require a society to cease an activity, or require corrective action, or suspend, amend or revoke a society’s designation. That’s pretty heavy-duty stuff as well.", "Enter into accountability agreements—it provides for no personal liability of a board of directors or an officer or employee of a society for acting in good faith.", "There’s really a bit of a concerning list here, Speaker. There’s actually quite a bit to deal with, and that’s not surprising in a bill that is 270 pages long.", "I do want to reiterate our support for this business of providing protection for those young people defined here as “children,” up to the age of 18, if needed.", "There were several private members’ bills. MPP Jim McDonell put forward Bill 32, the Right to Care Act, to offer that kind of protection. A previous member of this House, MPP Rod Jackson—his Bill 8 passed second reading and committee during the last Parliament with all-party support. It’s very, very important stuff.", "I am running out of time, but I just want to reiterate that in fact our MPP McDonell talked in his summary that in a challenging time during their development, 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds deserve the right to access care services if they need them. The alternative could be youth homelessness or deterioration of their physical and mental health, which prevent them from achieving their potential and affect local communities. That is the goal of this legislation, and, in many cases, in my view, providing adequate money for them perhaps to go back to school with the backup of a safe environment.", "So, here we are. We did hear on pre-budget hearings from the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies. There are 47 of them across the province, and I think we would do well to also investigate what they have to say." ],

There is a long-standing history and disconnect between the legislation that has been developed in this place to protect children and then the reality of how that legislation plays itself out in communities.", "I do want to thank, of course, our critic from Hamilton Mountain, who has been a very strong advocate for lending a new lens to child protection legislation in Ontario, and as well the provincial advocate, who has weighed in and lent his opinion about this piece of legislation.", "I do think, now that we have two outstanding pieces of advocacy work—that being Jordan’s Principle and Katelynn’s Principle—in the province of Ontario, that those new initiatives, if you will, those new eyes, that fresh look on how to protect children in the province should have been applied to Bill 89, the Supporting Children, Youth and Families Act. I will be addressing some of the gaps that this legislation brings to the fore.", "We have to remember that looking at a piece of legislation which is designed with the intent of protecting children has to put children and their families at the centre. I think the member tried to make this point in his commentary. I thank him for that, and I look forward to this debate this afternoon." ],

There are people who know an awful lot more about this than I do in this Legislature.", "I’ll mention my colleague MPP Sylvia Jones, who made a great point. I think she was saying, go past just the explanatory note in the legislation. Explanatory notes here are positive. However, the legal system doesn’t use those explanatory notes at the beginning of legislation; it uses the final law. So we the lawmakers, if we can refer to ourselves that way, have to get this right because, in my view, there is no room for error. We don’t need more court cases, and I really feel we don’t need unnecessary controversy.", "I’ll just pick up on the mention of CPIN, the Child Protection Information Network. Trying to pull that together for 47 children’s aids—this wasn’t a problem 110 years ago. I think it was 110 years ago when the Haldimand children’s aid was first established. It was probably the one and only social agency down in my area for 75 years. The Norfolk children’s aid was established later. And then the two merged. Now we try to coordinate across the province, given the mobility of people; hence the importance of getting the computer networking systems running properly. I know there have been some pilots, but there’s a lot more work to be done." ],

  "text" : [ "I have about 20 minutes to try to deal with this bill. This is a very thick bill with much to it. The effect of what this bill is going to do in the years to come could be quite significant. It’s unfortunate that we’re limited to the amount of time which we are at this particular point—the 20 minutes of debate—because I don’t think that gives justice to what has to be done.", "Let me try to break this down to a couple of parts. The first part is, with this bill—and I will predict it today—we are delegating most of the authority that we have as legislators, when it comes to putting real definition to what this bill can do, to the minister. I think that’s a real problem. When you’re dealing with issues around children’s aid, I think it’s extremely important that what we, as legislators, set out to do should be what guides the principles of the bill and what guides any regulation written after in order to give substance to the bill. In this particular bill, what we’ve essentially done is we’re giving, as legislators, authority to the minister—not just the Lieutenant Governor in Council, but the minister—the ability to put whatever they want into this bill, when it comes to the sections that are opened up, in a way that may suit his or her aims, whims, in the future. I think that’s really dangerous when it comes to the issue of dealing with children. We all know it.", "As legislators, we have people who come into our constituency offices on a pretty regular basis, unfortunately, who come in to see us in crisis. Or they come in to see us because they feel that the children’s aid is not taking something too seriously or the children’s aid is taking something the other way around. I get them coming in my office saying, “Oh, my God, children’s aid is coming down on us, and this is not fair. We’re the parents, so we should know what’s best.” And then you get the flip side, where people come into your office and say, “The children’s aid is not taking seriously the complaints about how this child is being treated.” The children’s aid is in a really tough spot when it comes to taking care of the welfare of children, because there are some really hard views on both sides of the issue.", "So I think it’s incumbent upon us, as legislators, to clearly define in the bill what it is that we’re trying to give the minister the power to do, or children’s aid the power to do. For us as legislators to say, “Oh, we’ll just delegate our authority to the minister and we’ll trust that, in the future, everything will be fine,” I think is a disservice to kids and, quite frankly, is a bit of a disservice to democracy.", "You’ve got to remember that the British parliamentary system—which, as Winston Churchill once said, is the best of the worst systems of democracy ever designed—decided that it was going to take the power away from the king, and that power was going to come to us, the people, the commoners, through our Legislatures or the House of Commons, as they call it in Britain, but for us, the Ontario Legislature. The idea was that we, with good counsel, with the work that we do as legislators, would try to make sure that we put in place laws that are reflective of the people, and that the law works for the people of Ontario—in this case, children. But what we do when we delegate our authority back to the minister is that, essentially, we’re returning to the bad old days before, I would argue, William II or Queen Anne. Up to that point, the kings had ultimate authority to do what they wanted. We’re going back to that, because we are, bill by bill, delegating our authority as legislators back to cabinet or, in this case, back to the minister himself or herself. I think that’s a disservice to democracy and also a disservice to the kids.", "Let me give you but one example that I think is very troubling. We have decided, in one section of this bill, to delegate the authority of this Legislature not to the Lieutenant Governor in Council, which means that it’s at least got to go to cabinet—which I still think is a problem, but at least there’s a larger group of people to give it sort of a one-see—but we’re actually turning around and we’re saying that the minister will have the right to designate individuals to meet tasks of a residential placement advisory committee, which sounds pretty innocuous, and the transfer regulations. Really? We’re going to give the minister the ability to do that without cabinet even knowing, let alone the Legislature? Is that a good idea?", "I think that the process we’re going through in this Legislature, where we do not allow bills like this sufficient time in committee—we don’t travel these bills into the community so that somebody who is concerned about children’s aid issues in this legislation, be it in Sioux Lookout or Cornwall or anywhere in between, has the ability to come to point out what that would mean. What would that mean to the average citizen? What would that mean to the child? What would that mean to the parents? What does it mean to the system?", "We’re going to delegate the authority of this Legislature directly into the hands of a minister? This minister may be well-intentioned—I would argue probably. I know most members in this Legislature, no matter what party they sit in, try to do the right thing; I have no doubt about that. But all of a sudden to say that the minister has the ability to do something that normally took the approval of the Legislature I think is a really big problem. I would say that this is something we should not allow. It’s a pattern, which I’ll come to in a minute.", "The other thing this bill does—and I’m going to tell you, I’ve gone through this twice. We’ve created two aboriginal children’s aid organizations in my riding: Payukotayno, which does the James Bay, and Kunuwanimano, which does all of the urban children living in places like Timmins. I’ve got to tell you, those children’s aids are very, very different when it comes to the communities they serve. What we’re saying in this particular bill is that we’re going to give the minister the ability to dissolve the board if he or she feels fit.", "Let me give you an example. About four years ago, maybe a little bit longer, we were in a crisis, as normally is the case on the James Bay. Children were committing suicide or attempting suicide. It was another one of those rashes about five or six years ago. So myself and the Grand Chief, Stan Louttit, along with the community chiefs from Winisk down to Moosonee—or Peawanuck down to Moosonee and Moose Factory—we worked at putting together a response. One of the responses was to support Payukotayno, to give them the staff to be able to go in the communities and intervene with kids before they attempted suicide. So they were given—and pardon me, I may be wrong on the number; I stand to be corrected, but I know I’m close—$2.4 million in order to shore up services in those communities to be able to do what needed to be done to work with those kids. It had a positive effect. We saw the suicide attempts in those communities come down.", "The government, in its haste to save money some years later—the same government that gave them the $2.4 million—took the money back. Guess what? We had another crisis—what was it, last winter?—where we had kids from not just Attawapiskat, but from across all kinds of communities along the James Bay and other communities in the north, having similar problems as we had some four or five years before. We’re now saying that if that board, the Payukotayno board, says, “No, we’re not taking this; we’re not accepting that you’re reducing our budgets by $2.4 million,” and decides to take some political action against the government of the day, the minister has the right to fire the board.", "Their job is to represent the community. In this particular case, when it comes to children’s aid societies on reserves, what drives those boards and what drives the community is very different than what happens in our urban communities. You can’t compare the children’s aid service that is in Kitchener–Waterloo to the children’s aid services being given on the James Bay; it’s apples and oranges. It’s just totally different. Those boards and those workers and those chiefs in those communities are driven by a whole different set of values. The functionality in those communities is very different than what we see in Timmins, Waterloo, Kirkland Lake or Cobalt. So we need to take that into consequence when making decisions around what a board does.", "Do boards, at times, make political decisions? Absolutely. But we live in a democracy, my friends. For us to say, as legislators, that we’re going to delegate the authority from this Legislature and from cabinet—the ability to be able to fire boards. We’re going to say to the minister, “If you, Minister”—he or she—“are unhappy with Payukotayno, Kunuwanimano or anything any other children’s aid society in this province is doing, you have the right to fire the board.” Come on. Really? Do we really want to do that, as legislators?", "This bill has got to go to committee. There’s a lot of good in this bill. I want to say that because people may think I’m being critical of the entire bill—absolutely not. There is some stuff in this bill that is super important and has to be done. That’s why this bill, yes, will go to committee. We’ll vote for it to go to committee, because I think it’s important for people to be able to have their say. But we’re going to have to look at these issues, and we’re going to have to say, “Is it wise to give the minister this much power?”", "I urge the government—I’m not wrapping up here, Speaker; I’ve still got nine minutes and 23 seconds. But I urge the government to travel this bill. This bill should travel to the different regions of this province in an intersession; I would argue this summer. You don’t have to pass this bill tomorrow. Allow the bill, in the intersession, to travel to some communities so that we can get some feedback.", "Imagine what this Legislature could learn and what the members on the committee and the minister and his and her staff could learn if we went to Attawapiskat, if we went to Sioux Lookout and if we went to Cornwall and we listened to what people had to say. “You know what? In the real world, on the real ground, this is what it means to me.” If we were to amend the legislation so that it becomes a working document that is clear in what its intentions are and is clear about who has the power to do what, why should we be afraid of that as legislators? Why should the government be afraid of that? Doesn’t that just strengthen the process?", "So I have a huge problem with what the government has put in this bill when it comes to the ability of the minister to be able to fire a board. I think that’s a real problem. Yes, at times, boards may disagree with the government of the day, and it could be of any stripe, but they are also there to represent.", "Now, there’s a whole other debate there, which we’re not going to be able to deal with in this bill. It’s how we appoint boards. The unfortunate reality of most of these agencies is that the person who runs the organization, under their own bylaws, goes and appoints people that he or she wants, and controls what they want as far as outcome, in the end, on the board. I know that’s the case with the mental health association and other groups that I’ve dealt with. That’s an issue. Maybe we need a bill in this House that democratizes these boards in some way and clearly defines what the roles are and what we expect of them. Should there be some sort of a clear, transparent election process within the organization to appoint people to the board? Should the municipal government and the provincial government, as the funder, have the ability to appoint people to the board so that the provincial interest be covered? Those are all legitimate questions for another debate at another time. But my point is that to give the minister the ability to fire a board, I think, is dangerous.", "The other one I want to warn you about, because we’ve gone through this before, is the powers of amalgamation under this bill. As a Legislature, again, we are delegating our authority off to the cabinet of Ontario and to the minister—in this case, it’s not even the cabinet; it’s the minister—to amalgamate boards." ],

I will tell you, I’ve gone through it with school boards in northern Ontario with my friend John Vanthof from Timiskaming–Cochrane, where we used to have smaller school boards. We have now gone to school boards that go from Moosonee to North Bay. Imagine when you’re the parent and say, “Hey, my bus is not picking up my kid.” How do you deal with those issues? Or, “My teacher’s aide is not doing what needs to be done for little Johnny or little Mary.”", "When you have large boards, they get further away from the people and they don’t necessarily do a better job of delivering services to people. We say, “Oh, but it’s more efficient. We save so much money.” I’ll tell you what it’s efficient at: boosting the salaries of the big managers. We end up creating more top management jobs, we end up making more bureaucracy on the top—and I’m a New Democrat saying that—and we end up paying people more money because, “Oh, I’ve got a bigger budget now, so I’m more important. I’ve got to be paid over $200,000 to do my job. I’m important for our community.” Amalgamation is not all of the answer.", "The other point is that the powers of amalgamation under this act also give the ability for the minister to amalgamate different types of boards. I didn’t see it excluded anywhere, so I may stand corrected here. But here’s the point: We have, for example, boards that serve francophone communities, like I have in my riding, right? It used to be, until this government came along—you had Jeanne Sauvé that did their thing and we had us who did our stuff in Timmins with the children’s aid society of Timmins or Porcupine—whatever we called ourselves.", "They went through a process of amalgamation and what ended up happening is that we lost—it’s still a bilingual organization. I’m not going to tell people there’s no respect toward trying to provide services to the francophone community. But I’ll tell you what it did: The language of administration is no longer French, which I think is important in that case.", "I’ll take it one step further. What would prevent the government under a future minister to say, “I’ll amalgamate Payukotayno, which primarily takes care of kids on-reserve, with Kunuwanimano, which deal with kids off-reserve”? It’s a totally different environment, and there are some good reasons why we have those things separated out. What prevents the government in the future saying, “Oh, we’ll just merge them together. They’re all First Nations; they’ll be fine with that”? Or maybe they decide that they want to amalgamate one or some of those boards with another, non-native board? That could happen in the future, under this act.", "I think that the government has not been wise—they’ve done some good things in the bill, I want to say again. Moving the protection age from 16 to 18: I think it’s a great idea. It should have been done a long time ago.", "But I’ve only got 20 minutes on this bill and I want to point out what troubles me, and what troubles me is that this House, by way of the bill that’s put forward by the current minister, is asking us to dissolve—not to dissolve, excuse me—to delegate our authority, as legislators, to him and cabinet on all future matters dealing with the issues in that bill.", "I think that’s a bad idea. I think, when we do that, we are stepping back in time. We’re going back to a day where, instead of a king or a queen having all the decisions to do what they want, having the person who sits in the Premier’s office decide who they want. Ultimate power in anybody’s hands is not a good thing. I think the good system of democracy utilizes its Legislature. We are here in order to pass bills, but we’re not here to dissolve our responsibility as legislators to the hands of the minister.", "I just want to end on this point, and that is, the time that bills stay in the House and the time that bills go into committee. I spoke to this just a few seconds ago. But I think it’s a huge disservice to the people we serve when the government decides that a bill like this, after six and a half hours, should be passed or time-allocated at the very least, and that the bill goes into committee here in Toronto, not in communities across Ontario, for a couple of days. Bills like this typically get two or three days in Toronto, and if you want to speak to it, you’ve got to get to Toronto to be able to see it and speak to it.", "How about I propose we have all legislation heard in Moose Factory, Ontario, and we’ll see how the rest of this province feels." ],

The honourable MPP from Barrie made reference to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It’s actually a very impressive and elegant document.

Well, there are, of course, a number of different items. One is, as has been mentioned, we’ll be raising the age of protection to include, to capture, to bring into the catchment area children who are 16 and 17 years old. We estimate that that will capture an extra, perhaps, 1,500 to 2,000 children.", "The other thing, of course, is there are a number of issues, whether it’s accountability or privacy or the child protection network. There are many tens of millions of records which we in the government are stewards of.", "I wanted to speak not merely as a parliamentarian, but also as a physician, because I am hopeful and also gratified to know that there are a number of strategies involving mental health services. Within the Child, Youth and Family Services Act, there’s essentially, I guess you could say, empowering or enabling legislation that will help a number of the agencies—there are about 30-plus; 31 of them have already been established—to help children who are suffering from mental health issues. As a doctor, I wanted to use this opportunity to say, if you do know of individuals who suffer from, as we call them, mood disorders or mental health problems or mental health issues, whether it’s anxiety or depression or PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, there are a number of symptoms. Folks who are suffering from these types of disorders will complain of things like a lack of sleep or non-restful sleep; losing interest in things; enhanced guilt; poor energy; inability to concentrate; loss of appetite; what we call psychomotor agitation, which is perhaps a polite way of saying wanting to smash your fist into a wall; and unfortunately, even things like suicidal thoughts. All of these, of course, are very real in our society. Individuals who are suffering from family separation, family breakdown, toxic divorces and so on are particularly prone. The other thing to note is that a family suffering divorce at any age—meaning the kids or the family members—is somewhat traumatic. If it catches children at a particularly youthful age—for example, if they’re eight, nine, 10, 12, 15 years of age—that really goes to their inner core. It kind of affects their soul and can actually lead to lifelong consequences.", "I’m very pleased that this particular bill, Bill 89, will help to address and, as I said earlier, empower some of our 30-plus agencies to address this type of issue—mental health disorders, anxiety disorders, bullying and so on." ],

Covenant House has done an outstanding job with young people who find themselves without a home in many cases. They’ve been intervening on their behalf over the years. Bruce Rivers says the following: “We welcome the positive changes the province has announced today to modernize Ontario’s child and youth service system. This is an important step forward to improve outcomes for vulnerable youth. In particular, increasing the age of protection to 18 will make a profound difference for vulnerable youth by giving them access to more services and supports.”", "That is a very critical age that we’re looking at.

Ms. Ballantyne said the following:", "“We welcome the opportunity to work closely with our partners in government and across the sector to continue to advise on the implementation of this new legislation and these reforms to the child welfare system. This legislation will allow for stronger services, improved outcomes and place an emphasis on prevention. We are particularly pleased to see the age of protection raised to 18, and we are delighted by the ministry’s continued support of the One Vision One Voice project to improve outcomes for African Canadian children and families who come into contact with the child welfare system.”", "At this point in time, I should mention as well that those who have worked in the system over the years—the dedicated staff in children’s aid societies across our province—are deserving of the highest of praise, working as they do individually with the families and the individual children who come into their care.", "In addition to that, those who volunteer to be on the board of directors of the children’s aid societies across the province have a genuine interest in the welfare of those children, and I want to commend them.", "There’s another quote I have here that I think is significant, particularly as it relates to an individual group within the province.

Child and family services in Ontario are in need of significant reform, including legislation that replaces offensive terminology with current and more appropriate language and ensures that Métis children, families and communities are recognized, respected and included along with other indigenous peoples. The Métis Nation of Ontario sees the new legislation as a step toward more effective, prevention-based approaches to improving outcomes for Métis children and youth, which is a shared interest of the MNO and the government of Ontario as set out in our MNO-Ontario Framework Agreement. We look forward to reviewing the bill and participating in the dialogue that will follow its introduction, and to developing a stronger partnership with the government of Ontario in the area of child and family services for the benefit of all Métis children and youth.”", "I want to say lastly—because I want to leave some time for the Minister of Transportation—that it’s encouraging when we see that representatives of the three parties in the House are in fact in favour in principle of this legislation. I think it’s a recognition that there’s a major challenge out there in terms of children in care, as we refer to them, and that this challenge requires some significant changes which are contained within this bill and which will be also affected by regulations which are promulgated to go with the bill. I think that’s exceedingly important.", "I would say that this goes past partisan consideration. As a member of the government, naturally I’m pleased that our government has brought this forward, but when I’ve listened to debates over the years, I can see that members of all political parties represented in this House are genuinely concerned about the children who are affected by this—children being not just to 16 but to age 18.", "I look forward to the potential passing of this bill, perhaps unanimously, by the House. Everyone will make that choice, ultimately. Of course, the committee deliberations are always significant because they allow the public to have input.

I think her remarks were particularly moving and particularly telling with respect to demonstrating that Bill 89 is striking the right balance as it relates to moving forward with a number of measures that I know many on all sides of the House have talked about, as it relates to child, youth and family services through the years.", "Listening to the debate, whether it is members on the governing side or members from the opposition benches, Speaker, I think one watching or perhaps reading Hansard later on would understand why it is so critically important for us to move forward with this legislation. Obviously, this is a bill that elicits a great deal of interest and a great deal of passionate discussion and debate.

I could spend some time this afternoon going through or elaborating on some of what I just referenced, but I really think, with my remaining time, I would say, again, having listened to the discussion, the debate that has come forward from all members in this House, it is clear to me that through the rest of the legislative process, certainly as this bill hopefully makes its way to committee, I fully expect that there will be significant interest, and understandably so, on the part of the public for them to play their role and to make a meaningful contribution to the discussion and debate.", "I would also say that I had the chance earlier today to hear, in the course of the debate in response to some of the previous debate, the minister responsible for children and youth, who stood in this place and spoke. He is a colleague that I have known for some time, and the level of passion, the level of interest and energy and enthusiasm that he has brought to the debate, but also to the formulation and the creation of Bill 89 and all of its very complicated aspects, is something that I believe needs to be noted. It needs to be acknowledged and, frankly, I would say, on behalf of my constituents, I thank that minister and his entire team and his ministry for the incredible work that they have brought to bear on Bill 89.

I share those concerns very strongly. I noticed the same points as I was reading through my bill briefing here. It talks about giving him the right to remove and appoint directors to boards, to amalgamate directors, to appoint a supervisor who can make all kinds of orders and demands on children’s aid societies and enter without a warrant or notice. That would be a terrible thing to allow to happen. Even police in this province cannot enter property without a warrant or a notice, and if there is a serious risk of a problem, a warrant can be obtained. So I don’t think we should allow that law to change, or that tendency or respect for the law, or the respect for freedom and democracy.

Fathers have come to my office and complained, at times, when there’s been divorces and the children’s aid society gets involved, about how they are treated, and how they are not treated fairly and not treated equally. There is an opportunity with this legislation to look after that bit of business, which is a very serious matter. There’s a group in Ontario called the Canadian Association for Equality, which fights for men’s rights, and that group should be listened to and should come to our committee." ],

A lot of them who have come into our office actually blame themselves for some of the problems at home, and it affects their schooling. You talk about education: When they’re going through a tough time, you see their marks start to fall, you see them quit their sports teams, and then you end up seeing how stressed they become. If we take a look at what’s going on today in the province of Ontario with young people—we see it even in Niagara, as MPP Bradley will attest to, where young people are committing suicide in record numbers in Niagara.", "The other part, which the bill doesn’t touch on as much as I’d like—and I’m glad the minister is here; maybe he can hear this. When we have split-ups, a lot of times the grandparents are affected by that. You take a look at my colleague Mike Mantha, who brought forward a grandparent bill, a private member’s bill; before that, it happened to be a Liberal, Kim Craitor, who brought it forward a number of years ago and it was never passed. But it has been passed by this House, and it should have passed by this House.", "One of the concerns I have is that the grandparent sometimes is the parent. The way the marriage has split up, they end up living with the grandparents. It’s important for the minister to hear this, because the grandparent bill should be incorporated into the bill as well, grandparents sometimes being the parents.

The former Barrie MPP, a colleague and friend—my former seatmate, in fact—Rod Jackson’s Bill 88 proposed allowing temporary care agreements to be made with children aged 16 and 17.", "Mr. Jackson’s advocacy on this issue put into the spotlight the troubling scenario of children aged 16 and 17 being turned away from service, and provided a straightforward solution which all three parties supported.", "Mr. Jackson’s advocacy on this issue led to him being presented with the annual Youth Legal Services Award. The award is given to an individual who has provided an outstanding contribution to the lives of street-involved youth, both by supporting the Street Youth Legal Services program and by acting as a motivator and leader in reducing youth homelessness.", "While Bill 88 did not receive royal assent, his proposed legislation helped pave the way for the proposed legislation that we’re discussing today, Bill 89.", "My congratulations to Rod Jackson for his work and advocacy finally being adopted.", "While private members’ bills often get stuck in committee, despite having support from all three parties, hopefully, it will be adopted, if we get there.", "Having support from all three parties, it’s a victory when an individual’s solution to a problem is put into legislation. Well done, Rod.", "More recently, my colleague and friend the member from Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry, Jim McDonell, proposed similar legislation in Bill 32, the Right to Care Act, in 2016.", "So this government has had two separate opportunities in the last four years to address what many saw as an obvious gap in child care. MPP Rod Jackson’s Bill 88 was sent to third reading. I’ll just say that four years ago, we could have done this. Hopefully, we’re finally getting it done today, or certainly in the near future, once it goes to committee.", "By creating a legislative mandate to protect these children, it is my hope that it will create another lever for the government to address the heinous crime of human trafficking.", "Mr. Speaker, from Hansard on February 22, the comment was made, I believe, by either the parliamentary assistant or the minister: “We hope that through consultation with societies and communities, there will be voluntary restructuring to improve services to children, youth and their families.” If the goal is to provide the child protection system in Ontario, then I believe that sentence needs a lot more meat on the bone. Please explain to me how making child protection agencies larger, how amalgamating them so that individual communities no longer have what will be volunteer CAS boards participating—when we take that away, how does that make child protection agencies and child protection in the province of Ontario better?", "It really struck me when she said in her opening remarks, and I would love to have some clarification—Mr. Speaker, I alluded to very briefly in my earlier comments that we’ve had an amalgamation happen within Bruce and Grey counties to form one board. I think, speaking to the chairs and to the executive director, it was a very arduous, very challenging, very time-consuming and very laborious process, but they now have a construct that’s working. It’s efficient and truly is helping kids.", "But to say, just because that one worked that another amalgamation that is forced or directed by a minister at any time doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s going to be a better system. Getting bigger sometimes could actually lead to large administrations, large bureaucracies and more money going to that administrative bureaucracy than it is to the care of the children.", "One of the concerns that has been raised in here a lot today, although I may use different words, is a “thou shalt” in the province of Ontario, that no child protection agency can pass a budget that is going to be in a deficit. Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, thou shalt look in the mirror and make sure that our budget—because in the five years I’ve been here, this government has not passed a single balanced budget. They are proclaiming they will in 2018, but I would suggest that they’re actually going to do it with a lot of repercussions and negative impacts to the people of Ontario.", "I heard one of the ministers earlier just this afternoon speaking about that 25% reduction in hydro rates. What they fail to leave out is what the increase in rates has been under the 14 years of this government. If you raise it 220% and give me 25% back, that isn’t really being the hero.

We have to look at those things.", "Part of the legislation is about CPIN, the new computer system. Again, when I was in the family, children and youth services and the social and community services critic portfolios, this government introduced a program called SAMS. SAMS was a colossal nightmare. The people, again, at the front lines who needed that money were the people impacted time and again because they rammed through a piece of technology that wasn’t well-developed. It wasn’t ready to go to market, Mr. Speaker. I think the cost was about $292 million, which was a direct impact. Then, there were a number of municipalities who actually covered all of the overtime because of that colossal nightmare, which again is either another tax to go back to that municipality or money that didn’t go to many front-line services.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m questioning, when they say they’re going to implement these things, whether they’ve truly thought them through, they’re truly ready to be implemented and they’re actually going to serve the purposes they say.", "I believe the Auditor General reported that eHealth is an $8-billion nightmare we have nothing to show for. So when I hear things, like CPIN, for a new program, I want to make sure—because this government doesn’t have a great track record when we talk about technology. EHealth is absolutely a nightmare.", "We have the diabetes registry, which I think was over $2 million, and still nothing to show for it.", "Mr. Speaker, I raise these concerns, because as I started in my opening remarks, everything we do should be about front-line care and the children that we are given the privilege to create laws and regulations and legislation to serve them the best", "Interestingly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child to include “every human being below the age of 18.” Providing service to a child to age 15 does not make sense when we know that people ages 16 and 17 are not only children, but are also vulnerable to abuse by caregivers. We also know that the ages of 16 and 17 are particularly important for development and are times of great change for children. So it seems prudent to ensure that those children receive the same support as their younger peers.", "I’m pleased to see this legislation addressing that. Again, I give kudos my colleagues, both Rod Jackson and Jim McDonell, for bringing this forward. It truly was a technicality. The child had no choice in being 16 or 17, but they didn’t meet this criteria and they didn’t meet that criteria. I truly hope that we won’t allow those children, just because of age, to slip through the cracks any longer.", "Rather than another tragic example of a child not being recognized by the child welfare system as needing assistance, these instances are where service providers know of a child who needs help, but the current legislative system means that they cannot receive the help they need. The proposed legislation will address this discrepancy by requiring a children’s aid society to protect children ages 16 and 17.", "One potential positive that this part of the legislation may bring is an added lever for the province of Ontario to combat human trafficking. Human trafficking is a heinous crime where victims, mostly women and children, are forced to provide labour or sexual services through coercion, all for the direct profit of their traffickers. Human trafficking affects children in every walk of life, but according to the RCMP’s 2013 report, Domestic Human Trafficking for Sexual Exploitation in Canada, individuals are most susceptible to traffickers when they need financial support or desire love and affection. The RCMP’s report also indicates that many victims are runaways from group homes or their primary caregiver’s residence. The ability for a children’s aid society to protect a child aged 16 or 17 at risk of or currently being trafficked is a positive element of this legislation.", "Speaker, I’m sure you are aware of the great work of my colleague and yours the member of provincial Parliament for Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock, Laurie Scott, and her advocacy on the issue of human trafficking in Ontario. I want to commend her for all that she’s done to help out in this area. Ms. Scott truly led the charge for the select committee, recognizing the significance of the problem of human trafficking in Ontario and sharing some surprising and, sadly, shocking facts that many in the public might not be aware of. So if this can help in any way, we certainly want to do what we can to support that.", "Another example of where the government has not taken action can be seen in the recent Auditor General’s report on child and youth mental health. The auditor found that, despite concerns being articulated in 2003 about the oversight of the child and youth mental health program, “the ministry still does not monitor and effectively administer this program to ensure that children and youth in need of mental health services are provided with timely, appropriate and effective mental health services, and to ensure that mental health services are delivered efficiently.” This is on top of a 50% increase since 2008-09 in hospitalization for mental health programs.", "I shared earlier in my comments that recently I had members from Parry Sound and Nipissing in who are currently on strike. One of their concerns is, is this truly just a cost-saving measure? Is this a case of a government who, again, has run deficit budgets the whole time I’ve been here and that has accumulated debt to a proportion of $300 billion-plus? We’re getting close to 2018, to an election, when they profess that they’ll have balanced the budget. Is this yet another situation where they’re actually cutting money back, forcing agencies to cut back on services and programs for front-line children in need, so that they can achieve a short-term goal? I certainly hope that is not the case.", "We need to ensure, as I said in my opening salvo and at every chance I’m here—I look at the pages every day here. They are our future; they are our youth. All youth need and deserve to have the programs and services when they need them. As a government, every government person in here should—and I believe everybody comes with the right intent, but some of the actions have taken away those front-line services by going down that debt road all the time. By accumulating that much debt, we are taking services from the front lines. We then have to turn around and say “no.”", "Some of those problems actually exacerbate themselves, which ends up meaning more money gets spent on some of those ills because of theory. The Green Energy Act is a prime example: the billions and billions of dollars that we’re going to spend on the Green Energy Act, on the theory of stopping global warming. Yet what happens to all of the other programs because we’re spending so much money? I think $133 billion is what that’s going to cost us over the life of the Green Energy Act.", "What could we do with that for these kids that we’re talking about in children and youth services, in children’s aid societies? Just the $11 billion we’ve spent on interest alone to service the debt payments each year—would we truly be having people coming through our doors, seeking help and seeking concern that they don’t have the programs and services today, if we actually had managed our finances better, if we hadn’t wasted so much money? When I say “we,” I’m actually reflecting the government on the opposite side, the Liberals, because it certainly hasn’t been my ability in here. I’ve voted against those budgets, because I’ve been very concerned that a precedent has been set. They continue to overspend, and that comes back every day in things like children’s aid societies and community and social services.", "Another area of this legislation is the powers of the minister regarding the oversight and funding of service providers. A number of colleagues in here have talked about how a minister, at his or her directive, can actually come in and usurp democracy by taking away, stripping away, the rights of people. That certainly is, fundamentally, something that we have to be very cautious of. At any time, as elected officials, we need to protect and enshrine democracy in our communities, in our province and in our country, and ensure that a minister, at any time, can’t just come in, because they have a choice and want to do something—particularly if it’s simplistic but hidden behind the scenes—and be able to force funds out of an agency.", "I know that when I first was elected, colleagues from children’s aid services in my backyard came in and very much addressed the concern that, as volunteer board members, they were actually financially liable if they went into deficit. What they were sharing with me was that more kids were needing programs and services, and the acuity of kids needing programs and services. They can’t control that. They step up for these roles because they care about kids and they want to do the right thing. So to be limited by someone else’s number that says, “You shall balance this budget,” particularly for many years when they’ve either been frozen or, in some cases, decreased—it’s very challenging for a board member to truly feel confident that they can fulfill the mandate of what they stepped up to agree about. So that is one thing.", "Amalgamation, which I spoke to—it isn’t necessarily always that bigger is better. Someone else, I believe, used those same terms today. In our case, in Bruce and Grey, it actually worked. It’s more efficient. They’ve streamlined a lot of services, meaning that money went back to the kids, which is really what we should all be doing, and I’m pleased to see that. But just to come in as a minister’s directive, to say, “You shall amalgamate,” and looking at some of the larger areas they’re looking at—I’ll use the Ontario Trillium Foundation. They were looking at cutting back from 16 local areas that were being served across the province to five.", "Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, it was rumoured, would be in a catchment area that would include Kingston. Mr. Speaker, that’s not local. You can’t actually have people that understand your unique community needs when you’re serving from an area as far away from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound as Kingston.", "In this case, that’s my concern: How big would be amalgamations become? How much money would actually be spent on administration and bureaucracy as opposed to the actual children?", "The other thing is, there needs to be clear and transparent processes. If a minister is going to come in and use those types of powers, everyone needs to understand exactly what the realities are. What’s the clarity? Why are they doing it? What is the expectation? There needs to be community input.", "Mr. Speaker, I can cite another example right now: school closures across this great province. Six hundred schools are scheduled to be closed by this Liberal government, yet they took out the community impact piece. They’ve taken out the ability for communities to truly consult and be there.", "I have two situations in my own backyard—and I’m going to talk about those tomorrow—where the community is rallying and saying, “We have solutions. We just need the government to come to the table and give us the ability,” because they’re the ones saying, “We want to see collaboration and partnerships.”", "I want to ensure that this legislation goes forward, that it goes to committee and that we focus on the rights and needs of the children, and the wishes of the child. We need to ensure that the child has a voice in all of this: the right to be informed in language suitable to their understanding; the right to a plan of care within 30 days; the right to be heard in respect of decisions of treatment, education, training or work, creed, community, identity and cultural identity, and discharge from a residential placement or transfer. The simple act of talking with the child may save lives.", "Actions must be taken to ensure that every filter we put any legislation through—in this case, very specific to children—is about what programs and services. Everything else has to be secondary to that.", "It is my hope that there are some good pieces in this legislation, but it needs to get to committee. The government truly needs to stop and listen to all people, and have all of the right stakeholders in those rooms. It has taken 32 years to get here. We could have actually done it four years ago, in regard to the bill of my colleague Rod Jackson.", "Mr. Speaker, I hope the government has listened today to this debate. I hope they’ll take into consideration all of the points. At the end of the day, may we provide new legislation that truly puts children first." ],

Just like many MPPs, I reached out to my local family, children and youth services and found that they were very close to getting CPIN up and running in Kitchener–Waterloo.

That is why the legislation needs to be updated.", "I will say that I find myself in a very interesting position here because, for almost two years, I worked on the transformation agenda which this government rolled out in 2008 and 2009. I was a researcher with the faculty of social work at Wilfrid Laurier, so I was travelling and speaking primarily to parents who had interactions with children’s aid societies across the province. I was in Hamilton, and I was in Kitchener-Waterloo. We went as far as London and Windsor. The goal, if you will remember, of that piece of legislation sounds very much like the preamble that’s contained within Bill 89, and that was around a child-centred focus and keeping families together, but that proved to be very complicated because you have to support families in order to keep those families together. That support costs a lot of money, and when you have a resource issue contained within those CAS agencies, it’s hard to follow through on that agenda.", "So the transformation agenda failed in the province of Ontario. I think it was well-intentioned. The research found that you started off really strong by supporting and teaching young adults how to be parents, supporting them on positive parenting strategies, not putting them into foster care but with next of kin and with close family relations, trying to support those family relations in keeping those kids within the family.", "That was the goal, and I think that is, in part, part of the goal with this piece of legislation, but it’s a lot of work to do that. You have to acknowledge it, and it is very costly. At the time, I don’t think the government was quite willing to embrace the true cost of that work, but it does break the cycle of abuse. If the goal is to invest in prevention and education and support of healthy families, it can cost more at the beginning, but it certainly costs less at the end, and it is the most compassionate option and some would say the most ethical option.", "Of course, language matters in legislation as well, and we share the concerns that have been used by several MPPs that there are a lot of “shalls,” “mays,” “with consideration” and “where appropriate,” and that should be of concern to every MPP in this House because it leaves the door open in a very subjective way.", "Now, I’m going to address the issue of race, and I’m going to be addressing the issue of First Nations, Métis and Inuit families, which the act does upgrade, actually, which is good, because language matters. I’m hoping that I can make the case that we have to ask the fundamental question: Why are so many First Nations, Métis and Inuit children in care? When we were doing budget tours, the Chiefs of Ontario came to the finance committee and told us that there are more First Nations, Métis and Inuit children in care today than there were ever in residential schools.", "It was a shocking stat for me, but also what followed in this presentation—and it’s a matter of public record—is, why are children taken from their families? Then you go to the social determinants of health of those families: You look at the resources that those families do not have; you look at the lack of housing in those communities; you look at the lack of education in those communities. Many people don’t know this, but when children are on-reserve and then they graduate out of grade 8, they usually have to go to a high school off-reserve. There are no supports basically to ensure the success of those children, so the continuum of care does not follow the child, and this remains an issue.", "It leads me to wonder how the province, even with the best of intentions with this legislation, is going to navigate through a long-standing issue that we have in this country and we have in this province. This relates around Jordan’s Principle, Mr. Speaker. Now, for those of you who don’t know, Jordan’s Principle is a child-first principle designed to ensure that funding disputes between jurisdictions do not affect the accessibility that First Nations children have to government services.", "The principle was developed based on Jordan River Anderson and his family’s experience with discriminatory health care services in the province of Manitoba. Jordan spent two years of his life in a hospital unnecessarily, all because the federal and provincial governments could not agree on who should pay for government services for status and indigenous children on reserves. Jordan was born with complicated medical needs and spent his first two years in hospital, but once his condition stabilized, his medical team determined that Jordan would be able to receive the care he needed in a home setting. Doctors, his family, his community and the community agency in Winnipeg worked hard to make all of the arrangements for his transfer, but they were ultimately held up by federal and provincial officials who could not decide on who would pay. While they were deciding about who would pay for his home care, Jordan stayed in the hospital. Advocates worried that Jordan was growing up in the hospital called for officials to allow Jordan to go home and deal with the funding dispute later. Their request went unanswered, and Jordan ended up passing away in a hospital in 2005, at the age of five, years after doctors had cleared Jordan to go home.", "So you will have these jurisdictional disputes between the federal and provincial governments, but it is important to note that this happens across the country, and it certainly happens in Ontario. Jordan’s case is not unique. Research shows that indigenous children are frequently caught in these inter-jurisdictional disputes. What is important for us to understand is that the intersection between federal and provincial politics on this is very real, but the principle for Jordan’s Principle is simple: It calls for provincial and federal governments to take a child-first approach to resolving jurisdictional disputes.", "The problem, of course, is that the federal level, the current Liberal government, is still in courts with aboriginal communities, Mr. Speaker. This is after a nine-year legal fight. In January 2016, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ordered that Canada comply with Jordan’s Principle. A motion in support of Jordan’s Principle was once again passed in the House of Commons in December 2016, three months ago, but the definition of it was changed. Jordan’s Principle aims to ensure that First Nations children can access all public services that are available to other children. The motion that was passed in the House of Commons redefined Jordan’s Principle to apply to children with complex medical needs, so you can see that the federal government is looking to not address all First Nations children, only some children who have complex medical needs. But according to the tribunal, Canada’s ongoing discrimination widens the harm wrought by residential schools instead of narrowing it. We have what is a well-intentioned piece of legislation at the provincial level, but we actually have a federal government—Prime Minister Harper took First Nations communities to court for almost a full decade on this issue, and the current Prime Minister has continued that fight, Mr. Speaker.", "Many of you will know Cindy Blackstock. She’s a personal hero of mind, and a huge advocate. On the 10-year legal process of Jordan’s Principle, she is quoted as saying, “You can imagine what has happened in children’s childhoods over the decade that the case has been winding its way through. And all these little stall techniques from Canada have an additive flavour—in among themselves they don’t sound so bad but when you add them up that is how we have gotten to the 10 years.” She makes the point that this has turned into a public relations exercise around First Nations. She is quoted as saying the government is “exploring ways to make a public relations gesture on Jordan’s Principle but falling short on compliance.”", "So you will have these nine children’s aid societies in Ontario for First Nations, indigenous communities, really becoming victims of the federal government. This for me is a point of personal shame, that our country is fighting First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities just to deliver basic health care and the same resources that every child should have access to. We should not have third-world conditions for children in the province of Ontario, and this includes clean drinking water and it includes having regulations on housing, like fire regulations, or even basic health care for children, and counselling, as the member from Timmins–James Bay has also mentioned.", "If that is not corrected, we will only see more children enter protective services, because neglect is one of the conditions, and any agency that sees a child in housing that is not safe or appropriate or clean, who is not attending school because of health care issues, who does not have the basic needs like food, like drinking water—this becomes a factor in First Nations, Métis, Inuit children being taken into care. The two issues are connected, and I dare anyone to tell me that they’re not.", "The issue on Katelynn’s Principle—and I was very pleased to see that the government has at least embraced part of it: There are elements of Katelynn’s Principle in various provisions, but they do not have the legislative force that Bill 57, the private member’s bill by the member from Hamilton Mountain, would like to have seen. We all would have liked to have seen those.", "Katelynn’s Principle is very similar to Jordan’s Principle, though it comes from the death of seven-year-old Katelynn Sampson in 2008. At the time, Katelynn was living with legal guardians and died from injuries she incurred while under their care. An inquest after her death showed that there were several occasions when appropriate authorities could have intervened and they did not.", "This is a debate that I will never forget, Mr. Speaker, with this private member’s bill. We had family here and we had advocates here, and there was a collective understanding that the system failed Katelynn. We will continue to fail children if Katelynn’s Principle is not fully embraced, if it is not a companion piece in Bill 89, Supporting Children, Youth and Families Act. This goes back to the very principle that a child’s view must be given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, and the child should be at the forefront of all service-related decision-making. Children will not be at the forefront of decision-making if those services don’t exist.", "This takes me back to the principle of resources. The amalgamation of children’s aid societies, bigger societies and less direct connection with those communities—I share the fears that some of the members have expressed that bigger is not better. We need a very direct and connected relationship with those communities, and those communities need to know that the front-line staff of those agencies who we have all collectively thanked today—but the stress of that job, when you are under-resourced, compromises the quality.", "I want to take this issue back to the quality of the care, quite honestly, because there are some worrisome parts for me in this. Some of you may not know this, but the contracting out and the privatization of protective services has happened for children in all of our communities. I don’t know if you’ve ever done this, if you’ve knocked on a door where there’s no name or anything, but it is a home for kids in care and there are usually five or six, and there are some child service workers there in the house—those are the children who have been taken into care who cannot find a foster home. This is a direct purchase for service that a private company is delivering.", "What the children’s advocate has found and what the Auditor General has found is that those kids are overly medicated to control behaviours, because these are children with complex needs, and they are often used with restraints. The overuse of restraints in these homes was found to be a huge issue.", "What I mean by opening this door is that we have to understand that when kids are in care, it isn’t always straightforward. It’s wonderful to hear the member from Barrie talk about her positive adoption, but the more kids that come into care—the resources need to follow those children. Those services need to follow those children. At the end of the day, the minister responsible has this overarching power to follow a mandate in this preamble—which is a progressive preamble, as I mentioned, but there is definitely a disconnect; I don’t know what other word it is.", "I just want to leave you with one other point, because we will try to address this at committee. I think the idea of travelling this bill to remote communities would really drive home the points that I was trying to make today. The provincial advocate has said that there is no overall vision for children in care. We need to talk about that. What is the end result—healthy children reaching their potential, well-supported in our communities, so that every child can be successful.", "Thank you very much for your time today, Mr. Speaker." ],

The preamble does, of course, acknowledge the unique relationship between Ontario and First Nations, Inuit and Métis people. In addition, there’s also a reference to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and Jordan’s Principle as well. Jordan’s Principle and Katelynn’s Principle have been very much integral in terms of informing this piece of legislation.", "In terms of purpose and interpretation, it’s also important to note that we’ve expanded the services to children and young people so that those services will be provided in a manner that respects regional differences. It will also respect a young person’s race, ancestry, place of origin, and their cultural and linguistic rights. I think these are all extremely important points to remember.", "As well, we have added a new statement about the rights of children and young persons, which includes the right to express their own views freely. They need to be at the centre; they are at the centre of the discussion in this very important bill.

I was absolutely surprised that there were close to 2,000 people there, and they were absolutely surprised that in First Nation reserves in Brantford they still can’t drink the water. In Grassy Narrows, we’ve got mercury in the water. We have to do better for our First Nations, not only around this issue.

So those same children whom we say we care about—we lock those workers out, and what do we do with them? We replace them with replacement workers.

I think that is a very important aspect, particularly for the city of Toronto, where we know that over half of the residents here in Toronto were born in another country. Many, many newcomer families here have young children. It’s so important to make sure that we have a culturally sensitive approach when we talk about children and youth services.", "I myself, in the short three years serving my wonderful community, have had opportunities to speak to parents who are challenged.

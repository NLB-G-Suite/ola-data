  "text" : [ "Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to address this bill. There are a lot of different ways to approach it. I would say that what is most critical is: first, understanding the context within which this bill has been brought forward, the context of the electricity system that we’re dealing with and the costs that have been imposed on the people of Ontario; and then, finally, what there is in this bill that is of consequence and what there is in this bill that’s simply a recycling of previous legislation.", "I think, Speaker, in debating this bill we have to first look at: Why are we debating this bill? Why is it before us today? I had an opportunity when the minister first introduced the bill to make a few comments. I think that the information I provided then was useful then and will be useful to note again now. We’re debating a potential rebate on people’s hydro bills today because there was a Liberal loss in Scarborough, in an election last month. Mr. Raymond Cho is here this morning, elected in Scarborough–Rouge River to the surprise, chagrin and horror of the Liberals. They felt that they owned this riding. They felt that it was their birthright. They felt that it really didn’t matter what they did, who they put forward, that it would be theirs. But as you are well aware, that isn’t the way that election turned out.", "In that election, I had an opportunity, as I’m sure you did, Speaker, to go door to door in that community and talk to what I thought were a pretty decent bunch of people. And the cost of electricity was very much top of mind; it was very much something that had seized their attention. And even though in Ontario we have increasingly faced, as the years have gone by, people dealing with difficulty with high and growing hydro bills, that wasn’t a pain that this Liberal government felt. It wasn’t a vulnerability that they felt as consumers feel when they’re dealing with their bills. They only felt that vulnerability, they only thought that there was a crisis and a problem, when they lost a seat that they thought was theirs, that they thought they owned. Finally, it has come home that, “Hey, we could lose an election on this issue.” And so we are dealing with this bill today.", "I’ll just note, Speaker, that it was interesting to me, I think it was the day after the bill was introduced, that Liberal staffers at subway stops throughout the downtown, possibly at bus stops in Scarborough and Etobicoke and North York, perhaps at transportation hubs elsewhere in Ontario, were out giving out flyers talking about this 8% reduction.", "I should note as well, Speaker, that the Premier has put out an online petition allowing people to register their interest and their concern for a reduction in their hydro bills. It’s quite extraordinary to me to see a governing party have a petition in place to petition themselves to do something that they’re about to do with a bill they’ve brought forward. I can only think that it was an email-harvesting opportunity and they didn’t want to miss it.", "But that is why we are debating this bill. I cast back to 2010, when the gas plant in Oakville was cancelled; again, roughly a year and a half, two years before a writ was to be dropped and an election commence. There was concern about the loss of a number of seats. Frankly, something had to be done. Something was done: The plant was cancelled to protect those seats.", "In the case of Scarborough–Rouge River, the government has had a wake-up call about the unpopularity of their approach to electricity, their callous disregard of the population of Ontario and, ultimately, the callous indifference with which the people of Ontario will feel about the governing Liberal Party.", "So the function of this bill is a political function. This bill is about salvaging, protecting the Liberal Party. It has little to do with their concern for the people of this province, something that manifestly is not there, and it does not deal with the fundamental problems in the electricity system that I will touch on as I go through my leadoff speech this morning.", "Speaker, as you’re well aware, the NDP opposed putting the HST on electricity when the HST was first introduced. We see it as a necessity. We see the imposition of a tax on that necessity as unfair and we have called, in fact, for the repeal of the provincial portion of the HST on people’s hydro bills. So we don’t think it’s a bad thing to give people a rebate, but we do think that people need to understand why this bill is before us today and what the fundamental issues are that are not being addressed by this bill.", "If you want to characterize the Liberal approach to the hydro issue, there are a few elements here. There’s denial—and I’ll enlarge on that—there’s cynicism—and I have a lot of material on that—and there’s privatization, making friends, colleagues, associates, banks very wealthy. Those things are fundamental to Liberal hydro policy in this province.", "Let’s look at denial, first off. The new Minister of Energy has denied that there was a problem, wouldn’t use the word “crisis” when he was asked about rural energy prices or electricity prices. He had an opportunity in an interview recently to talk about a report from the Financial Accountability Office. He had an opportunity when he was speaking in the House yesterday to talk about electricity prices. It’s intriguing to me that the minister would take the words of the Financial Accountability Officer—and I guess this shouldn’t be intriguing, this should be considered normal—and reshape them to promote the Liberal narrative on electricity. What did the minister have to say? Let me just take a look." ],

  "text" : [ "Well, I’m not that worried about what the minister’s doing now. He has much time on his hands.", "The minister was talking about the Financial Accountability Officer and saying that families in Ontario spend less money on electricity, on average, than every province except British Columbia. Now, that may well be true, but I would say that there’s a commonality between southern Ontario and the lower mainland of British Columbia, and that’s that across Canada they may have the mildest climate. It’s not a surprise that people who rely on electricity through cold, dark winter months are going to use less in southern Ontario and the lower mainland than they will in Manitoba or Alberta or Saskatchewan or Quebec, all jurisdictions that are substantially colder, jurisdictions that in many ways use a lot of electricity for heating.", "The minister went on to say that the total home energy cost is in the middle of the pack when compared to other Canadian provinces, which is also interesting because it doesn’t bear on electricity. It bears on the fact that we are close to American sources of fracked gas—fracked in a way that I think is environmentally irresponsible, not sustainable economically or environmentally, ultimately not sustainable socially. But it has meant very low prices. To claim any credit for a lack of forethought on the part of American producers is completely irrelevant to the debate that we’re having here. Cheap fracked gas is not the issue that people are dealing with. What they’re dealing with is very high electricity prices. That is a substantial matter.", "I note, Speaker, that Ontario now has the highest average electricity rates in Canada, with the possible exception of PEI. I think we’re a contender with them from time to time. Manitoba Hydro has a table that one can access on the Web—prices current as of May 2016—and it shows Ottawa, Ontario, as the highest residential bill charge compared to a variety of cities—Calgary, Edmonton, Halifax, Moncton, Montreal, Regina, Saskatoon, Saint John, St. John’s, Vancouver, Winnipeg—$127.61 a month as opposed to the lowest, which is around $55.02 in Quebec. So the reality is that we have extraordinarily high electricity rates.", "The United States energy information agency has a chart of electricity rates by state that provides up-to-date state averages that can be compared with Ontario’s average rates. When you take account of the currency differences, the energy information agency chart shows that Ontario’s average rates are higher than any other region in the continental US except for the region of New England. But that’s just the average rates. Ontario’s rural rates are much higher. Hydro One’s low-density rates on a 750-kilowatt-hour bill are bigger than Connecticut’s, which has the highest average rates among the 48 states in the continental US, and are tied with Alaska’s and second in Canada/US only to Hawaii. So we have very high rates compared to other jurisdictions in North America, and that’s what’s at issue here today.", "Speaker, I had an opportunity to ask the Minister of Energy a question the other day about energy rates. I noted that there’s a particular burden on rural and northern Ontario. Francesca Dobbyn, executive director of the United Way of Bruce Grey, recently declared rural energy poverty to be a crisis. “People are angry, they’re frustrated and they don’t know what to do,” Dobbyn told the CBC. “They’re being told it’s their fault ... you left a light on.” Dobbyn has met people who have had to walk away from their houses because the hydro bill is bigger than the mortgage. She says the largest hydro bill the United Way has worked on was $22,000. It’s a big bill; it’s a very big bill.", "Losing power in rural areas can mean losing drinking water. In July, the Toronto Star reported on a 74-year-old pensioner who got her hydro cut off by Hydro One at the very moment she received new energy-efficient appliances paid for through Hydro One’s home assistance program. Not only did the pensioner lose her lights, she lost power to her well pump, which meant she also had no drinking water and, frankly, no water for a toilet or a shower. That is how energy poverty can turn into a public health crisis.", "Despite this, in July Energy Minister Glenn Thibeault refused to use the word “crisis” to describe rural energy poverty. He also said he had no idea how many people are behind on their hydro bills and didn’t know if the province even collects such data. Speaker, for your information, for the information of the House, for the information of anyone who may be watching on television at the moment, Ontario does collect such data. About 567,000 households were behind on their bills as of December 31, 2015. That’s up by 94,000 households from 2013. A lot of people are having difficulty with their hydro bills, and they’re having difficulty for a variety of reasons, but centrally because Ontario has pursued a course of action that has made electricity very, very expensive.", "The Premier and the former Minister of Energy have said in this House that we make a profit on hydro sales here in Ontario. In fact, I raised this issue in the House with the former Minister of Energy, and I was thrown out for my remarks, which were termed unparliamentary. I have to say to you, Speaker, that it is very difficult for me to talk about this file without using unparliamentary language. I restrain myself. I’ll let your imagination run riot as to what unparliamentary words I might use in talking about the Liberals in this matter.", "The reality is that we sell close to $2 billion worth of power to Quebec, Michigan, New York and others, and we get $500 million on it. Speaker, when you sell something worth $2 billion and you get $500 million, you’re not making a profit. You may be cutting your losses. You may regain 25 cents on the dollar. But you’re losing; you are not profiting. For this government, for this Premier, to have maintained that we’re making a profit when we’re losing money is extraordinary. I can’t use the words that I think would accurately describe it. I know, Speaker, that you would call me to account. You might even tell me I was using unparliamentary language if I spoke what I truthfully believe are the actual words about the minister and the Premier.", "Speaker, we do have a crisis. I know I noted the words of the head of the United Way of Bruce Grey. But I have to say that twice in the last month, when I’ve been going door to door in my riding, I came across people having tremendous difficulties with their hydro bills. I came across a senior who had gotten her bill for a thousand dollars—a thousand dollars. She was just totally perplexed. What does she do with a thousand-dollar bill for electricity? What can she do? Where is that money going to come from? She’s completely, totally at a loss. Speaker, my guess is that in your riding there are people who are dealing with similar bills, who have similar anxieties, and may well have contacted your office about it.", "I came across another senior who is on oxygen. She said to me, “I need to use this oxygen all day long. I can’t get overheated, so I have to have air conditioning on. Because the oxygen dries you out, I have to have a humidifier going.” Her last bill was $700. She said, “I’m disabled. I’m on a pension. I don’t know how to deal with this bill. Is there any way that I can get a substantial cut in this bill?” I told her about the Ontario Electricity Support Program, but frankly, at $700 for a bill, she needed a lot more than $30 a month or $75 a month.", "That is an ongoing and common problem: people having difficulty dealing with these bills, and this government denying it on an ongoing and regular basis—denial first, denial second, denial third, denial at every point as to what’s going on, until Mr. Raymond Cho from Scarborough–Rouge River wins a by-election; then, suddenly, denial is a problem. Suddenly denial is a problem.", "I want to look at the cynicism in the approach that the Liberals take to the electricity file. I’ve had an opportunity to make brief comment on this previously, but I’ve watched this over the last 10 years that I’ve been here. When the Liberals are challenged on high and soaring hydro rates, they say, “We needed to get rid of coal. We need to have clean energy. We need to have green energy.” Speaker, we did need to get rid of coal, and we do need to have green energy. But that isn’t the heart of the hydro price crisis that we have in Ontario; far from it—far from it.", "As I’ve said this before in this chamber, David Herle, who does polling for the Liberal Party—bright guy, clearly astute, understands how the population works—did a presentation, I believe it was to the Canadian Nuclear Association, recently about his polling. He was pretty straightforward. He said, “If you tell people that you’re raising prices to do something they want to have done, and they want clean air and they want society to take on climate change, if you say prices are rising because we’re dealing with coal and we’re dealing with clean air and we’re setting things up for climate change, then you have a defensible position.”", "So whenever there are attacks, when the Conservatives on this side of the aisle say, “You know what? The problem is green energy,” the Liberals on the other side say, “You’re right. You’re right, it is green energy.” So green energy gets caught in the jaws of those two proponents and chewed up, because on this side it’s a great attack line, on that side it’s a great defence line, but in the end it’s green energy that suffers, climate action that suffers, while both pursue their actions.", "The Liberals don’t have to validate what the Conservatives are saying. They run the system. They could actually look at the numbers. They could speak to it, but no, they’re using the lines that were developed for them by a very astute and very capable pollster who told them, “This is your best defence.” Thus, the attacks on green energy by the Conservatives are validated by the Liberals, to the disadvantage of this province as a whole.", "Cynicism showed up in the cancellation of gas plants in Mississauga and Oakville. I had an opportunity in 2008, when the Oakville plant was proposed, to point out to the Liberals that electricity demand was dropping, the plant was unneeded and they shouldn’t be proceeding with it. Nope; didn’t matter—didn’t matter. Exactly what all the machinations were in the back rooms, I don’t know. Who it was that they were trying to mollify and make happy, I don’t know. But instead of blocking it in the first place, which they should have done, saying, “We have dropping demand; this plant will increase the cost of electricity; the bad location. We don’t need it. We won’t proceed,” no, they proceeded, they took on a political risk, and when that political risk blew up in the then Premier’s face they decided, “Boy, this is not worth it. We could lose a few seats here. We’re going to cancel this.” But not only did they not cancel it, not only did they say they were going to cancel it and then, recognizing yet another risk, build it somewhere else—so we had a plant that wasn’t needed in the first place, we spent a billion to relocate it and it’s now producing power we don’t need. Similar events happened in Mississauga.", "Those cynical moves were astounding on their own, but I want to look at what I call the slushifying of the cap-and-trade funds. For those who are given the responsibility of taking down our words, you’ve heard Shopify; you’ve heard Spotify. If you’re slushifying something, you’re taking money that should be used for a purpose that’s critical and using it for a political purpose that serves your ends. We’re raising cap-and-trade funds to deal with climate change.", "You should know, Speaker, that the current climate action on the part of the government is inadequate to deal with the climate crisis, will not bring about the reductions that are needed. That’s all the existing policies. The ones that are coming forward in the climate action plan are still inadequate. You need a very sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to actually meet the commitment that Canada made in Paris in December, commitments that are going to be ratified, apparently, within the next few months. The Liberal approach with their climate action plan in Ontario won’t even meet the commitment that Ontario signed onto with subnational governments—the Under 2 memorandum of understanding, the Under 2 MOU—won’t meet that, very consciously.", "This government knows that it won’t meet those commitments, and yet it is going to be using the funds to reduce the costs of electricity to industrial and commercial electricity consumers. I don’t see anything wrong with addressing their needs; let’s talk about how that’s to be done. But taking funds that are desperately needed for a program that the government says is critical to our future and using them for a very short-run political objective of dealing with rising hydro prices is directly contrary to everything that the Premier and the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change had to say when we were debating climate change and their climate bill.", "Frankly, Speaker, I had an opportunity to get briefed the other day by ministry staff, and it was intriguing to me, in talking about how the money was going to be used, that not only was it going to be used to deal with rates, but they talked about using that money to help with the nuclear fleet here in Ontario. What does that have to do with cap-and-trade? The money is supposed to be raised to put new measures in place to actually drive down our emissions so that we can protect ourselves, but in reality that money, in turn, is going to be used as a slush fund to deal with the political problem the Liberals have today. Speaker, I do find it quite extraordinary—quite extraordinary.", "I note that the Minister of Energy, in his remarks yesterday, talked about the commitment of this government to produce power that was safe, clean and reliable. I had an opportunity to note this before, but I will just note it again: You’re talking about reliable power? I had an opportunity in December 2013 to climb eight storeys in an apartment building in my riding where the power had gone out. There were people who were stranded in apartment buildings in a variety of places in Toronto, seniors on top floors who couldn’t negotiate eight, 10, 20 or 30 storeys. They were out of luck.", "This government has known since it was elected, and society has known since the late 1990s, that ice storms were a threat to the reliability of power, and yet that wasn’t addressed. That wasn’t an example of reliability.", "A number of months before that, in the summer, we’d had a significant rainstorm event here in the GTA. The western part of the GTA had big power interruptions because a transformer station was flooded out—again, something that we have to expect, which this government should have expected but didn’t plan for. I talked to the people at CityPlace who saw their power go out four times, five times in two weeks. Speaker, this government talks about reliability but doesn’t deliver it. If you ever get the opportunity, if you’re on Twitter, put in the hashtag #darkTO for power outages in Toronto. It tells you about the reliability of the system. In a lot of places, it’s not reliable at all.", "This government talks about clean power, but it currently has a proposal out there that you can sign up to, to get payment for electricity generated by burning garbage. Now, first of all, burning garbage is completely contrary to the goals of the climate action plan. The more stuff you burn, the more carbon dioxide in to the air and the more climate change. But if you’re talking about clean power to subsidize garbage-burning incinerators in this province, and the Independent Electricity System Operator is developing a procurement initiative in support of “new-build municipal energy from waste”—that’s the general word for garbage-burning projects—to say that you’re in favour of clean power and that at the same time you’ll subsidize municipalities to burn garbage is completely wrong and completely contrary to any suggestion that you’re going to build a clean system.", "Beyond that, a few decades ago Ontario signed contracts with what are called non-utility generators: small in-place generators burning gas to make electricity. Seventy-five per cent of those contracts will be expired by 2018—1,200 megawatts. It’s a lot of power. It’s a lot of gas.", "We’re in a situation right now where we have a surplus of power. It’s my understanding—and I look forward to clarification and tabling of documents by the Minister of Energy—that those contracts are being re-signed. In fact, there’s an opportunity to make the system cleaner, and to my knowledge, the government is not taking advantage of that.", "I think that saying you’re committed to a clean system, when you support burning garbage, and continue to burn natural gas, with contracts that have expired and could be cancelled, is not an honest approach to the problems we face with the electricity system.", "Speaker, why are rates rising? I’ve talked about the cynicism of the Liberal government on this. I’ve talked about their denial. Let’s talk about, concretely, why rates are rising.", "If you want to actually deal with rising rates, soaring rates, you need to understand what’s driving the dynamic in the first place. I’ll start with privatization, and that means we have to start with Mike Harris and Ernie Eves, who really set things in motion. There was a great series of headlines: Dalton McGuinty, running in 2003, talking about his commitment to public power, how he was going to stop this initiative, how he understood the threat of privatization. But the reality is that once the Liberals were elected, they made sure that all new power generation in Ontario was going to be privately owned—great election rhetoric; very grim power reality.", "One of the things that the Liberals inherited from the Conservatives was the privatization of the Bruce nuclear complex. That was leased to British Energy around 2000—British Energy, which subsequently went bankrupt in the UK because nuclear power was uneconomic and had to be profoundly subsidized by the British government to keep 25% of their power going. The leasing of that Bruce complex allowed the owners of Bruce nuclear to generate about a half-billion dollars a year in profit. Take a look at the annual reports.", "Prior to that leasing, that half-billion dollars, which is worth about 2.5% on hydro bills—one plant—is now part of the money that we have to pay for hydro, something we didn’t have to pay in the past.", "I’ve had an opportunity to talk to people who are part of that ownership group of Bruce nuclear, and they refer to it as the “money fountain,” and I think that’s an accurate description. We think of it as a place that generates power, but they see it, perhaps more accurately, as a money fountain.", "As the Liberal plan of privatizing the system piece by piece—rather than wholesale—rolled out, we added more and more profit to our hydro bills. So I think it’s very difficult to find out exactly how much profit there is in the system now. My best estimate is somewhere between $750 million and $1 billion a year. It’s a lot of money for a system that costs $20 billion overall. It’s substantial. But those decisions are part of what’s driving up hydro rates, that privatization directly.", "But the other part of it is that with the privatization of generation, your ability to correct a mistake is dramatically reduced. We found that out with the gas plants. When the government tried to shut them down, they realized, “My goodness, we’re on the hook for 20 years of profits. We could lose big time in court.” So our ability to deal with too much generation means that we can’t act, or we find great difficulty in acting, when those are private plants.", "It was interesting to me that there was a decision a number of years ago not to proceed with the building of new nuclear power plants at Darlington. OPG, Ontario Power Generation, was simply told, “You’re not proceeding with that.” They didn’t get any compensation for that. It was just simply a decision. Gas plants: “You’re not proceeding with that.” Suddenly, we’re deep into huge legal risk and potential huge expense.", "That tradition of privatization started by Mike Harris, carried on by Dalton McGuinty, set the stage for the current Liberal Premier, who may be the greatest privatizer of all. I noticed today that John Tory is taking a page from her book, talking about selling off Toronto Hydro. I’ll say to John Tory and members of city council, having gone door to door in my riding on this issue, this is very unpopular. This will not sell well. People understand that this is bad news for them; they understand that. The sell-off sets the stage for higher rates.", "I want to talk to you about one little item that came up, that this government engaged in, just before the sell-off. I had the opportunity to be in the estimates committee, questioning the Minister of Energy about the sell-off. There is a $2.6-billion expense in the Ministry of Energy’s estimates. For those who don’t know this, every year government ministries put out publications showing how they’re going to spend their money in the year to come, and we get an opportunity in committee to actually sit down with ministers and attempt to get answers. I’m not saying we get answers; occasionally, by mistake, an answer is given, but we try to get answers in estimates. Some $2.6 billion was an expense for the Ministry of Energy because they were going to give $2.6 billion—they weren’t just going to; they gave—to Hydro One very few minutes before it was going to be sold, put on the market, so that Hydro One wouldn’t have to pay the departure tax.", "When the Tories set up the privatization of the hydro system, they put in a requirement that if you sell a utility, you have to pay a tax to help reduce the debt that’s outstanding from the old Ontario Hydro. That’s something that local distribution companies have a problem with. They want to take advantage of those sales—sorry, if local municipalities want to sell those utilities, they’re going to have to pay a tax. But the Ontario government gave the $2.6 billion to Hydro One, which gave the money back, so in effect, they didn’t pay a penny on departure tax. The investors got a $2.6-billion gift from the Ontario government, the government that’s selling Hydro One to raise money for transit. “No, no, no—$2.6 billion? Here’s a pass. Enjoy it, guys.”", "That $2.6 billion could have been used to reduce Hydro debt. It could have been used to flow through back to rates. It could have been used to flow through back to rates, something that this government refused to do. Speaker, with these guys, the games never end and the rates keep rising.", "The Liberal government says that the Ontario Energy Board will protect consumers, and I actually heard the mayor of Toronto using exactly those words this morning, that the OEB will guard against soaring rates. So let’s look at some recent history, if you will. When the smart meter initiative came forward, did the Ontario Energy Board do an analysis of the impact of that initiative on rates? Did they? In fact, Speaker, they didn’t. They didn’t actually take on the responsibility. They were simply told to make this happen and they did their part to make it happen. They didn’t stand up for consumers. That added $2 billion to hydro rates in Ontario with minimal savings, minimal positive impact on the system—and I emphasize the word “minimal.”", "When Hydro One was being sold and we asked the OEB to review the sale, because it’s their responsibility to review those significant decisions that will impact on rates, no, they declined. There’s a guardian for you. “Here’s a big issue. It’s going to change hydro rates in Ontario. You need to be looking at this.” Did the OEB act as a regulator? Did the OEB actually stand up for consumers and assess the impact of that deal? Not for an instant.", "Recent changes in legislation gave cabinet, the Lieutenant Governor in Council, the power to say, “We need to build a transmission line here and you, OEB, don’t get to question anymore whether or not building that transmission line is a rational use of resources for the system. You get to assess whether or not the purchase of this bolt or that tower makes sense, but you don’t get to look at the fundamentals.” That is a regulator whose powers are constrained, whose ability to protect consumers is cut back.", "Speaker, energy decision-making is politicized. There are lobbyists who will push for this or that investment. There are power brokers who are able to drive cabinet decisions. To say that the OEB is going to protect consumers from this new, privatized world is—I’m sorry, I would have to use unparliamentary language and I won’t, but—" ],

There aren’t the protections there. I would say that at best, the Ontario Energy Board, the regulator, is a drowsy chaperone, and at worst they’re just a glove puppet.", "Actually, that’s the one other instance that occurred to me. Recently there was a decision not to put the cost of cap-and-trade on people’s gas bills, to bury it in the delivery charges. What regulator would say that? There weren’t people there who were saying, “No, no, bury it.” No, it was the OEB staff who was doing that. Whose interest does that serve? Does it serve the interest of the government of the day? I would say it does. I would say that speaks very profoundly to the lack of the OEB’s ability to actually protect the people of this province.", "The other major factor that we need to understand is that we have been overbuilding capacity in this sector, not reducing capacity when it was clearly surplus. That has given us a problem that actually has a term in the electricity sector: “surplus baseload generation.” We generate an awful lot; we don’t have the demand for it. In fact, in the last decade demand has been dropping for electricity here in Ontario, which will surprise most people. But as auto plants and auto parts supplier plants have shut down, as manufacturing is shut down in southwestern Ontario—Xstrata shut down in Timmins; Stelco shut down in Hamilton—there’s less and less demand for power. It’s a simple reality.", "I want to just quote from a recent report from the Consumer Policy Institute. I don’t agree with everything they have to say but I thought they had some interesting commentary on the fundamental problems we face in Ontario with electricity. In their executive summary, and I’ll quote here: “Ontario electricity customers are paying more each month to cover the costs of selling cheap power to out-of-province ratepayers.", "“Since 2005, Ontario customers have unwittingly paid $6.3 billion to cover the cost of selling the province’s surplus electricity to customers in neighbouring states and provinces. Most of that bill—$5.8 billion, or nearly $1,200 for every household in the province—has been incurred since 2009, as demand for electricity in Ontario has declined, while generation capacity in the province has continued to grow.", "“Ontario’s power surplus is largely a result of provincial directives, which have directed Ontario’s energy agencies to sign contracts with a growing number of electricity generators, promising them a guaranteed, above-market rate for their output. The power surplus has pushed the average wholesale price—the value of power on the province’s electricity market—to a record low in 2016.”", "As an example, the gas plant that was cancelled in Oakville and is now being built in Napanee, far above market, surplus power to Ontario’s needs—frankly, Speaker, that’s one example. When the Bruce nuclear complex brought on two more reactors in 2012, in a market where the power wasn’t needed, we were stuck with the extra bills. Take a look at 2012-13. The market cost of power goes down; the global adjustment goes up; more power is sold outside Ontario. We’re putting in place generating capacity that we don’t need.", "I’ll just note, Speaker, this isn’t just Ontario. In New York, they have a big power surplus because, again, they’ve lost manufacturing. We’re no smarter than them. We could be smarter. If we owned the system, if we hadn’t privatized most generation, we could be making these decisions, but we haven’t.", "To go back to the report: “To offset the growing gap between what the province has promised to pay generators and what that power is worth in the wholesale market, provincial ratepayers pay a charge called the global adjustment, which has grown, on average, 20% annually over the last five years. The global adjustment now accounts for nearly 90% of the revenue earned by exporting power.", "“The combination of an increasing number of generators receiving a fixed rate for their output, depressed market prices and the decline in electricity demand in Ontario has created a large and growing surplus of power in the province. Instead of curbing their production in response to low demand and prices, generators have maintained their production levels, requiring an increase in exported power.”", "The math is fairly straightforward. I know that the Conservatives like to say this is all green power, but green power is actually a fairly small part of total power production in Ontario. We’re talking gas plants. We’re talking nuclear plants. We’re talking about a lot of surplus power, which all of us are paying for.", "“Ontario ratepayers are left covering the difference between what the province has promised domestic generators for their output and what that power is worth when it is exported, since export customers don’t pay the global adjustment. Ontario ratepayers are now paying the lion’s share of the cost of exporting electricity.” Next time you look at your bill, realize there is someone in New York or Michigan who’s very grateful to you for having subsidized their electricity.", "Speaker, if you look back at the history of power planning in this province over the last decade, you’ll see that a number of years ago it was understood that as nuclear power plants at Darlington and Bruce had to be refurbished, as the Pickering plant came to the end of its lifespan, generation would have to be in place to deal with that drop in production. So we built more gas plants than we needed because they were going to be used to take up that slack. We built green energy, which we need because we’re going to make a transition away from fossil fuels. In the end, the refurbishment has been pushed back into the future. The Pickering plant is now looking at a government decision to be open until 2024. All of the elements are there for a continued surplus of power, which we’re paying for.", "If you actually look at your hydro bill, and the Independent Electricity System Operator had this in their recent Ontario power outlook report, power costs have increased 32% in Ontario from 2006 to 2015—32% because of increases in the cost of the system: more generation, more power lines etc. That’s over a decade. Power costs have gone up 40% because of a drop in demand. Fewer and fewer companies, fewer and fewer households are buying as much power as they did in the past. So the bulk of the problem in Ontario has been this drop in demand not matched with an appropriate level of generation. People need to understand that. As we lose industry, which is tragic, and as we are more efficient, which is positive, there hasn’t been an adjustment to the system, and that has led to much higher bills.", "Now, in the bill itself, the government’s new rate-relief package includes an 8% rebate for residents and small non-residential consumers. The new rebate is enabled by legislation that’s nearly identical to the Ontario Clean Energy Benefit Act. I said earlier that there would be an act that would be recycling. That is today’s recycling. We have a bill that has come back with some modifications. That was an act that provided a 10% rebate between 2011 and 2015—2011. Yes, there was an election in 2011. That bill came in just in time for that election, and it stuck around long enough for a second election. So it was a two-election-cycle bill—very efficient from the government’s point of view. They only had to go through reading the bill once, but it gave them cover for two elections. However, with the outcome of the election in Scarborough–Rouge River, we’re back to having to make those kinds of payments.", "When the rebate was announced on September 12, finance minister Charles Sousa was repeatedly asked whether the rebate would be permanent. He ducked the question, saying, “We haven’t established a date to end.” The next day, the Premier insisted that the rebate would be permanent, although she didn’t explain why her finance minister was unaware of this the day before. I can only speculate, Speaker. I can only guess that the balloon was up in the air. There were enough bullets shot at it, and they realized that putting in an end date would be politically dangerous, and they decided not to do that.", "This is a rebate. It’s not an HST exemption. We expect it will be more costly to administer and more cumbersome to administer as opposed to simply reaching out to the federal government and getting an exemption.", "I’ve heard the Liberal government say, “No, no; we’re putting in the rebate because it’s quick. If we go to the federal government, then it’s going to take a longer time.” You actually could, if you wanted to be quick, put this in place now, with it to lift when an HST exemption comes into place—or surely the Premier, who worked very hard for the current Prime Minister to get his job, would be able to call in some favours. Whatever, Speaker. To say that an HST rebate or exemption negotiated with a federal government is a block doesn’t hold water, in my opinion.", "There is a huge advantage, though, in being able to put an item on people’s hydro bills. This government is going to have a line on hydro bills: “Rebate.” Whether there will be a smiley face of the Premier on the bill or not, I don’t know yet. That’s still to be decided; I know the OEB is going to wrestle with that. The big advantage in not having an exemption is that ability to put a line there. Just as they were able to delete a line on gas bills, they’ll be able to put a line here. Again, it speaks to my concern that the OEB really, in many ways, is just a toy of the government, doing what it wills.", "The government has noted that it’s enhancing the existing rural rate relief program to reduce delivery charges for low-density customers, giving them an additional $30 or so a month. That’s something all the other ratepayers in Ontario will pay for. It’s about $1 a month on everyone else’s bills.", "The government is also expanding the industrial conservation initiative, which allows large energy consumers to reduce their share of the global adjustment by reducing their electricity demand during moments of peak demand, which I think is a good idea. If there are companies out there that can reduce their demand when we’re at peak, it reduces the need for generating capacity. But as you’re well aware, Speaker, all those generating plants have been built, and whether they produce power or not, they get paid. It comes out of the global adjustment. We may reduce demand for the product, which is a good thing, but I have real doubts that it will reduce the costs of the electricity system itself. Some people will do better, but the costs will still have to be picked up.", "The bill is fairly simple, fairly straightforward in that. I think I’ve outlined the background to the bill, the political context of the bill, the context of measures in place—privatization, overbuilding of capacity—that have driven up the cost of electricity here in Ontario. I want to say that those who are counting on a fairly nice reduction in their rural Ontario hydro bill should be aware that Hydro One was granted a 19% increase in their rates by the Ontario Energy Board—6% a year over the next three years, so a little bit more than 6% if you’re getting to 19%. These reductions will not be pretty quick.", "Now, people should be well aware that the Ontario Energy Board was criticized by the Auditor General in her last report for not being very thorough with Hydro One in its examination of their bills. Hydro One asked for rate increases to replace transformers several years in a row, and those transformers weren’t replaced. Come in one year and say, “I need this money to replace these transformers,” you get the money. Next year, you come back and say, “I need the money to replace these transformers.” Was Hydro One asked, “Hey, we thought we gave you that money last year”? No, they weren’t.", "I had an opportunity to question the head of the Ontario Energy Board at the public accounts committee. She assured me that they did not audit the proposals by the bodies that were seeking higher rates. They didn’t audit what was there. They could be asked multiple times for rate increases to pay for the same thing; the Ontario Energy Board would never know.", "I was told, “You know, we have these intervenors who are looking at these bills.” That’s extraordinary to me, that the regulator is not doing the thorough and due diligence that’s required to deal with double counting; in fact, is relying on intervenors, who operate on very limited budgets, to keep applicants for rate increases honest. To be kind and to be parliamentary: It’s a broken system—broken, at best. How can you expect a regulator who doesn’t even dig into applications to protect you? How? You can’t.", "There are a variety of risks to the rates in the future that this government doesn’t address in this bill and doesn’t address in its hydro policies. There’s an expectation about what levels of power we will consume in the future. As I’ve said to you, the biggest piece of the increase in hydro rates in the last decade has been the drop in demand for power and the fact that we’re stuck paying for a system that has fixed costs, even though demand for it keeps dropping. The potential is there for that demand to keep dropping.", "There are counterbalancing elements, but if you actually follow what’s going on in the electricity systems around the world, there is a huge drive to drop that demand. LED lighting dramatically cuts the amount of power needed for lighting. There are other energy efficiency technologies coming on stream that drive down demand. There’s the growth of low-cost solar and battery storage that has got the electricity sector throughout the United States spooked.", "In fact, it was about three or four years ago—I think the Edison Electric Institute had a meeting of all the big utilities in the United States to look at the changing world of electricity production and demand. They looked at what happened to the telecom sector with deregulation and how a change in technology—a move from land lines to cellphones, from cellphones to smart phones—radically changed the economics of that sector. They understood that that radical rewriting of the electricity system was something that they were going to have to come to grips with.", "Now, it’s interesting to me that the Ontario Energy Board, aware of this, has started moving people’s delivery rates on their bills to a fixed charge. So if you are paying for electricity, you know that on your bill there’s the cost of getting the electricity through the wires from the generator to your house. In the past, that’s been much more related to the amount of power you used, but the Ontario Energy Board is changing that so that it’s fixed. As they say, small users will be paying more, large users will be paying less. That’s going to have an impact in rural and northern Ontario. They aren’t the big users. They use power, but they’re not going to be at the top of the scale.", "Why did the OEB do that? If you read their report, it’s pretty clear that they understand that the coming drop in demand for grid power is going to have a big impact on the economics of the system here in Ontario—a very big impact. This government—and we’ll see what happens with their next energy plan, later this year—has not been paying attention to that. It continues to re-sign contracts for non-utility generators for gas-fired power that we may well not need.", "In doing their assessment of the refurbishment of nuclear reactors at Bruce and Darlington, did they actually look at the alternatives? Did they look at what is going to happen in the future? Did they do a solid business case?", "I have to say, Speaker, there was no solid business case done. There was a comparison only to gas-fired generation. They didn’t look at conservation. They didn’t look at distributed energy. This is a government that has been derelict in its duties when it comes to the electricity system.", "Speaker, this bill will not address the underlying issues that we face that are driving up hydro rates at an unsustainable rate. It is dealing with an immediate political problem. It’s hoping, at a year and a half or two years out from the next election, that they will have done enough to ensure their survival.", "But I think that between the increases we’re seeing from Hydro One and the other increases we can expect, coming up this fall and next spring—people remember that rates are set twice a year—this reduction will soon be eaten up. If the government doesn’t deal with the fundamentals, it can’t deal with the issue with a band-aid." ],

Coal cost about 2.5 cents a kilowatt hour; energy efficiency cost about 3 cents. It’s pretty close.

I’m very proud to be an Ontarian and living in this incredible country. I took an opportunity to go to the Arctic with my 28-year-old daughter. We flew into Greenland, took a beautiful boat—the Ocean Endeavour—down the longest fjord in the world, up the coast of Greenland, stopping in at some small Greenland communities, meeting with the native people and looking at what they do and how they survive there, then across the Davis Strait, north of Baffin Island, up near Ellesmere Island. It was the most extraordinary trip.", "On board the boat, organized by a group called Adventure Canada, there were at least a dozen scientists—biologists, marine biologists, botanists and archaeologists—and historians, and we got lessons almost every single day. We got to look at where we were and what we saw. What we saw was stupendous. We saw icebergs like you’ve never imagined. We had, in a big boat, to manoeuvre our way around these huge sheets of ice, because never before had they ever seen this many ice floes in this area, breaking off the face of glaciers in the north. It was absolutely extraordinary.", "I met an explorer named Jerry Kobalenko, who has personally sledded over 20,000 miles across the Arctic over the last 20 years, a modern-day explorer. We got to the top of the mountain where Franklin last put a marker, and that was—what?—three weeks before they discovered the Terror.", "This is an adventure.

That was until a 68-tonne railway car backed over top of him.

This spring, he danced in the Dancing with the Stars Quinte competition, finishing second; his partner, Lisa Vance, was a big part of that. But this past summer, he continued to defy the odds, climbing the tallest mountain in Africa.", "Following the Kilimanjaro climb, he said he wanted to give up on the first day. He said, “I reached numerous extremes of sheer exhaustion, pushed to physical, mental and psychological human boundaries that resembled a place when I was fighting for my life 23 years ago.”", "He’s also caught the attention of Canada’s Walk of Fame.

It is a place where we can realize our dreams.", "When I first arrived in Canada, I did not dream that one day I will have the privilege of standing in the Ontario Legislature and serving so many hard-working Ontarians." ],

Those challenges and barriers for women include harassment, gender-based discrimination, violence, exploitation and deprivation in many forms.", "The fact is, women represent more than one half of our population, but they are unjustifiably underrepresented in leadership roles in business, professions and public life. Bill 16 seeks to encourage a dialogue amongst women, girls and everyone else in our society about the challenges and barriers that women face for no reason other than their gender.", "We all know that female role models can motivate, inspire and encourage a healthy discussion as to how to overcome those challenges and barriers faced by women and girls going forward. With that idea in mind, and to further our society’s dialogue about social justice and the equality of women, I thought long and hard about who might inspire my fellow Ontarians to ask questions about the role of women in society and about who could stand as an example of what women can achieve. Of many successful and inspiring women role models, one person, nonetheless, stands out strongest, and she is Hurricane Hazel.", "Even in retirement, Hazel McCallion continues to serve her community with complete devotion and extraordinary energy, and at 95. In my humble opinion, Hazel McCallion is a true example of tenacity, courage, fighting spirit and sincerity. She earned and built that reputation over years of hard work and struggle to succeed in a man’s world.", "She demonstrated that tenacity and fighting spirit when she played professional hockey in Quebec; in business, where Hazel climbed the corporate ladder in Montreal and then in Toronto; and in public life, where she was elected deputy reeve of Streetsville in 1967, mayor of Streetsville in 1970 and mayor of the amalgamated city of Mississauga in 1978, followed by 11 election victories between 1980 and 2010—many times winning over 90% of the vote share. When she retired, officially she had served 36 years, the longest of any Mississauga mayor, and the very-longest-serving female mayor in Canadian history.", "For all those and other achievements in her life, she also enjoyed a successful married life with her husband, Sam, and raised three children.", "On their own, Hazel’s accomplishments are laudable, but as of 2014, her retirement—that looks by most standards like a full-time job—makes her life of achievement and contribution to public life truly extraordinary.", "Hazel McCallion rightfully took pride in managing an efficient municipal government, growing her community from a collection of small towns to Ontario’s third-largest city, with almost 800,000 residents. During her tenure, Mississauga has attracted leading companies from around the globe, including over 50 Fortune 500 companies.", "I have known her to lend her energy to great causes in the community, including charitable work, literacy, higher education, sports, arts and culture. She has encouraged young women to pursue sport as a member of the board for the Ontario women’s hockey league. She helped to have the Hershey Centre built in Mississauga. She supported the establishment of the Mississauga campus of the University of Toronto and she is committed to supporting Sheridan College, which has two campuses in Peel region, one of which is named after her. She now is the first chancellor of Sheridan.", "For her hard work, dedication and example, she has been awarded numerous honours at the local, national and international levels. Just a few of these include professional association awards and having facilities named after her, such as the Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre at University of Toronto Mississauga, the Hazel McCallion Centre for Heart Health at Trillium Health Centre Mississauga, Hazel McCallion Senior Public School, and the Hazel McCallion Campus at Sheridan in Mississauga.", "She has received an honorary doctorate from the University of Toronto, the Order of Canada, the Order of the Rising Sun from Japan, and the cross of the Order of Merit from Germany, and she is a Dame in the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem in Malta.", "Madam Speaker, this amazing woman enjoys courage of conviction. She’s not bound by ideological walls. She always takes a stand—what she believes to be the right thing to do and that is in the best interests of all concerned. I believe Hazel McCallion is a fitting example of what can be achieved irrespective of gender-based challenges and barriers if one works very hard, tenaciously and sincerely.", "Today we not only have a cause to commit ourselves to, but we also have an amazing role model to follow. Ms. McCallion, thank you for giving so much of yourself to our community throughout your life and through your public life, offering such a fine example to women, and especially young and impressionable women. I’m very proud of you.", "I urge all members of this House to support and vote in favour of this bill." ],

So welcome, and congratulations on your win in Scarborough–Rouge River.", "As I look at Madam Speaker sitting in her chair in this hallowed hall of the Ontario Legislature, I think it’s safe to say that we are taking great strides and moving forward in terms of not only recognizing women’s successes, but their ability to make a difference and to contribute in such a worthwhile way.", "I have the honour of representing Ontario on the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians steering committee for Canada region. It is amazing to sit around a table with leaders from every province who are making a difference and inspiring women to get involved. I look forward to sharing that spirit next year when, in Ontario, we celebrate the 100th anniversary of women actually earning the right to vote and how far we’ve come.", "I congratulate the member from Mississauga–Brampton South for taking on this initiative because we have to celebrate women who have made a difference and have led the way. I think we can all here in the House today think about the women who have inspired us, women who have not only jumped over hurdles to lead the way, but have kicked them out of the way for the rest of us to follow. To the ones I’m thinking of personally, and I’m sure to everyone else, we say a sincere thank you to all of you who have done that, and Hazel McCallion is just one of those many people.", "I’ve been taken by the comments that have been shared by the member from Mississauga–Brampton South, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t recognize two women who opened up the doors a little wider for all of us here today. They are Agnes Macphail and also Margarette Rae Luckock. They were elected in August 1943 as the first two women members of provincial Parliament in Ontario. They’re revered and celebrated, but I must say, there’s a special connection to Agnes, if you will, because she was born in Grey county, which the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound would celebrate if he was here. I know he will be; he’s in his office listening to this right now.", "The reality is that Agnes was a real champion. She had a respected voice, and I think that’s really important as we look at what we’re doing here today. We need to respect the women who can sit down at a table and bring quality discussion and dialogue to help resolve issues. Agnes Macphail was one of those special people. It has been said that while she taught in Bruce county, she would come and visit the village that I live outside of, Teeswater, and engage people and encourage people to stand up and share their voice in order to make a difference.", "I think Hazel McCallion is no different than Agnes Macphail or Margarette Rae Luckock in that regard, and I also think that what this particular day will serve to do is to definitely increase the awareness of how we can all make a difference.", "Going back to the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians steering committee: We hold an outreach program every year to increase awareness of the opportunities for women in Legislatures across this province. I was very pleased to be able to be part of a team last year at this time when we hosted a CWP outreach program here in Ontario. It’s stunning, the number of women and young ladies who are eager to step forward, to make a difference, to become engaged.", "It doesn’t have to be at the level that we are celebrating Hazel at today. They can get involved in local community organizations. They can get engaged at the municipal level. They can become involved in provincial organizations, like we’ve seen so many do. If that encourages them or entices them to stretch farther, to make a difference—here within the Ontario Legislature, at the federal level or even back home at the municipal level—we need to celebrate that and encourage it.", "It’s very important to recognize that it wasn’t always easy. Just 100 short years ago, women got the vote, as I said earlier, here in Ontario. We’ve come a long way.", "I think this private member’s bill will continue to push the benchmark and push the barometer by which we measure women’s success further. I applaud her for that, and I look forward to encouraging Bill 16 later this afternoon." ],

It’s always an honour to be called upon in Ontario’s provincial Parliament to speak on behalf of my constituents in Windsor–Tecumseh.", "This private member’s bill, introduced by the member from Mississauga–Brampton South, would have us name the 14th of February as Hazel McCallion Day in Ontario. I guess I first heard Hazel’s name when I was a reporter at CBC Windsor. There was a train derailment in Mississauga 37 years ago I guess it is now. It made the national news. Heck, it made the international news; I remember Walter Cronkite stumbling as he tried to pronounce “Mississauga.”", "That was quite a while ago now. Propane tanks burst, as did a tanker of deadly chlorine gas. Eventually, 200,000 people were evacuated from their homes. Mississauga was shut down for six days. Most people say it was a miracle that no one was killed. In fact, they still call it the Mississauga miracle, as opposed to the Mississauga disaster.", "The first-term mayor of Mississauga at that time was Hazel McCallion. She would be re-elected another 11 or 12 times, sometimes by acclamation. She finally retired a couple of years ago at the age of 93. Speaker, Hazel is old enough to have been around the 11 times the Toronto Maple Leafs have won a Stanley Cup, and she says she fully intends to still be here when they win their 12th cup.", "Other than that, who is Hazel McCallion? Well, Speaker, just so you know, she was born behind a wood-burning stove in a small town in rural Quebec on the Gaspé Peninsula on Valentine’s Day in 1921. Hazel Mary Muriel Journeaux was the youngest of five children. She is a distant relative, by the way, through her maternal grandmother, of Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae. Of course, we all know him as the author of In Flanders Fields.", "Her family ran a fish plant and owned a small store. When it came time to go to grade 10, she went to Montreal and lived in a boarding house with an older sister. In grade 11, she went to Quebec City and boarded at an Anglican nunnery. They ran an orphanage but took in boarders to help pay the bills. Let’s just say she wasn’t the best of students, but she worked hard, she kept quiet in class and at the end of the year she went back to Montreal and entered secretarial school, and there she excelled. She could do shorthand at 120 words a minute.", "After graduating but before she started her first job, she took a trip back home to Gaspé to visit the family. One evening, while she was sitting on the front porch while her father smoked his pipe, a stranger came by—a stranger with a funny kind of accent—who was asking a lot of questions about the area. A couple of days later, the same guy was arrested and charged with being a Nazi spy.", "Hazel Journeaux then returned to Montreal to a secretary’s job at a paper company, but she also joined a woman’s professional hockey team. That was in the early 1940s, Speaker. She was paid $5 a game. That was good money in those days, and it helped pay her dental bill when she had a couple of teeth knocked out. To this day, she tells me that those are the only teeth that aren’t her own, the ones that were replaced; she says she still has her wisdom teeth.", "When war broke out, Hazel got a job at Canadian Kellogg. You might think that’s where she got her political snap, crackle and pop, but no, it wasn’t that Kellogg company. This Kellogg was an engineering firm and it had military contracts, many of which were top secret, such as playing a role in the Manhattan Project, which led to the atom bomb.", "Within her first few weeks, Kellogg was contracted to design and build the first synthetic rubber plant in Canada, and her job was to get it built on time and on budget. It also meant she had to move to Toronto to be closer to the Sarnia worksite. She was doing the hiring and the securing of the materials needed for the job. Before the end of the war, that plant was producing 90% of Canadian rubber. She was doing a man’s job in a man’s world.", "Kellogg engineers put together plans for a plant that would have been the first in Canada to extract oil from the Alberta tar sands. And they built the Four Sisters coal-burning hydro generating station in Port Credit. I mention that because some 50 years later, as mayor, Hazel was the one who pushed the button that blew that plant up as Ontario started the process of getting out of coal-burning generating stations.", "After 22 years at Kellogg, she left to help her husband, Sam, with his printing business in Streetsville. Her lasting gift from Kellogg was the $85 a month in pension cheques that she has been receiving since 1986, when she turned 65.", "Hazel met Sam when they were both members of the Anglican Young People’s Association. She got to go to the Oslo conference in 1947, and that’s where they passed resolutions urging Christians to run for elected office, help the poor and fight racial discrimination.", "Her first letter to a Canadian Prime Minister was to Mackenzie King, asking him to look into the unjust internment of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War.", "In 1964, Hazel McCallion applied for and was appointed to the planning advisory committee—the planning board—in Streetsville. Two years later, she was named chair of the board.", "She started her political career with a loss while trying to be the deputy reeve of Streetsville, but she won that position the following year. She was elected Streetsville’s mayor in 1970, just in time to get into a bare-knuckled, no-holds-barred political fight with Premier Bill Davis—Brampton Bill—over a forced regionalization of local government.", "Streetsville became part of Mississauga. Hazel went on to become the councillor from that part of the larger community.", "By 1978, she was a seasoned councillor and she decided she’d had enough of the old boys’ network and their way of doing things, and she went after the top job: mayor of Mississauga. The slogan the incumbent mayor was using was, “A good mayor.” The night before the election, Hazel and her team plastered stickers on her signs that said, “A better mayor.” The rest was history. At the age of 57, Hazel McCallion was the new mayor of Mississauga.", "She has never thought of herself as a feminist. She doesn’t believe in a pink quota. She’ll tell you that all you have to do to get ahead is “think like a man, act like a lady and work like a dog.”", "Speaking of dogs, she loves them and has always had them, especially German shepherds. She called one of them after herself—no, not Hazel, but Hurricane, her first female shepherd.", "That’s right: “Hurricane Hazel” is a moniker that has stuck. There was a hurricane in Ontario named Hazel that blew through in 1954, but unlike that Hurricane Hazel, which blew through town and then left after causing millions of dollars in damages, this one stuck around and built things, created jobs and kept taxes down while building up financial reserves. Hazel McCallion was one of the first politicians in Canada to call for lot levies and development fees, saying, “Growth should pay for growth.”", "Still, even at 5 foot 2, this Hazel, according to former Premier David Peterson, was a terror to any Ontario Premier and the only person he was ever frightened of. I remember when I would go to AMO or FCM conferences and a speaker would see Hazel in the audience in the front row and he would say, “You know you’re going to have a bad day when you show up at work at Queen’s Park, open your door and see Hazel McCallion in there waiting for you.”", "I was at the FCM conference in Quebec City in 2008 when we gave Hazel a lifetime achievement award for promoting women in municipal politics. I was also there when we walked up to the National Assembly, and Quebec honoured Hazel as a native-born Quebecker who had accomplished so much in her political life.", "I know she likes to quote former Ottawa mayor Charlotte Whitton, who was famous for saying, “Whatever women do, they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good. Luckily, this is not difficult.”", "When Hazel was 82, she was struck by a pickup truck while walking across the road in Streetsville. She was hospitalized, but she was out of the hospital and back to work before the truck got out of the repair shop.", "Rick Mercer once did a profile on her, and it has attracted more than 3.4 million views on YouTube since it was aired in 2009. She and Rick are out there playing hockey.", "She’s an avid stamp collector. She’s on the board of regents at the Ontario Women’s Hockey Association.", "She’s not perfect by any means. She didn’t always get along with her Mississauga councillors—I mean, “Parrish” the thought. Besides “Hurricane Hazel,” she’s been stuck with other monikers such as “the Mississauga Rattler,” “Attila the Hen” and “the Queen of Sprawl.” But say what you will, the voters of Mississauga loved her.", "Regrets? Yes, she’s had a few. She didn’t get enough time to spend money on public transit, she didn’t get a convention centre and hotel built, she never went to university, and she never spent as much time as she wanted with Sam. He passed away from Alzheimer’s in 1997.", "I’m running out of time, but I do want to just say that Hazel is a big supporter of the arts and she thinks arts and culture are as important as sports and recreation if a community is to flourish. With that in mind, Speaker, I’ll give you a little poem for Hazel:", "Run against her—if you dare", "She’s been hailed as Canada’s most Popular Mayor.", "Politically—more red than blue", "Remember the ad—Stephen—Do I look scared to you?", "Never known to pull her punches or to coddle", "But—cherished by women—as a political role model.", "For that she deserves a medal, maybe even a medallion", "Because she’s the one and only “Hurricane” Hazel McCallion.", "Born on Valentine’s Day in 1921", "By the time debate on this motion is done...", "Stand back, let me say it in stereo...", "We’ll have Hazel McCallion Day here in Ontario", "We’ll have Hazel McCallion Day here in Ontario", "Speaker, I’ve served with Hazel on the FCM board and the AMO board. She’s a political rock star. She’s well known and recognized across the province and across the country. She’s one of a kind. “Sure, she’s sometimes pugnacious, but she’s no rapscallion... / She’s Hazel—’Hurricane’ Hazel—McCallion.”" ],

Actually, she would have been the first woman to be elected. She and Agnes Macphail were actually the first women to be elected. Back in the day, when you got sworn in, it was done in alphabetical order, but because Agnes Macphail had already served as the first woman elected to the House of Commons, it was actually Margarette Rae Luckock who was sworn in second. She gave up her first spot to be sworn in, to give that to Agnes.", "I mention Margarette Rae Luckock because back when she got elected, she represented an area that is currently part of my riding of Davenport, so I’m very proud of her. As the first female MPP elected for Davenport with the current boundaries, here in this Legislature, I cannot be more honoured and proud to support the member’s motion, which proposes to proclaim February 14 each year as Hazel McCallion Day in Ontario.", "Madam Speaker, as you know, our province strives to eliminate gender-based discrimination and to eliminate the many barriers that women in this province still encounter.", "Madam Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to once again recognize you as the first Chinese female Speaker in Ontario.", "Former mayor McCallion’s professional life and numerous contributions are reflective of the leadership role that women can and should be entitled to seek in a fair and just society. I am proud and honoured to recognize the contributions of former mayor Hazel McCallion, who helped shape the history of Mississauga and all of Ontario.", "Mayor Hazel McCallion deserves to be recognized for her tremendous contribution to the city of Mississauga, the province of Ontario and the world we live in. She stood up for what she believed in and encouraged all women to be more engaged in the political process. Mayor McCallion’s achievements are notable for their number and scale, as well as the social atmosphere in which she began her career.", "Though women had been elected mayor of other Canadian cities previous to Mayor McCallion, political life was nonetheless widely regarded during the 1960s, when she entered politics, to be a man’s domain. Her continued participation in public life since that time, and even into retirement, makes her a brilliant example to women and, indeed, all Ontarians.", "I’m honoured to work with my female colleagues on this side of the House, along with our Premier, Kathleen Wynne, the first female Premier in Ontario, as former mayor Hazel McCallion did, to bring more women into politics and to educate and empower future generations of women politicians.", "Once passed, I will be especially proud to share it with the many female leaders in my community and all my constituents in Davenport.", "Earlier this year, I was able to recognize a number of these female leaders in Davenport with the Leading Women/Leading Girls program, led by the Honourable Tracy MacCharles, minister responsible for women’s issues, a program that acknowledges and celebrates women and girls who demonstrate exceptional leadership in working to improve the lives of others in their community.", "Every year since being elected, I have participated in Girls Government, a bipartisan initiative that aims to encourage more women into politics by giving girls a first-hand taste of politics and political advocacy. Giving young people their first-hand look at the Ontario Legislature and how policies are made will set them on a path to becoming more engaged citizens and to become the leaders of tomorrow.", "My goal is to encourage them to become involved because, no matter what your age, you are never too old or too young to participate in politics, and you must always keep learning and growing in your life. It is important that young girls know that they can and should play an active role in their communities.", "I also want women and girls to know that, just as former mayor Hazel McCallion did, they can stand up for what they believe is right and that they can step into the shoes of trailblazing women in politics, like Hazel McCallion and our very own Premier Kathleen Wynne.", "As a female MPP, I feel it is our collective duty as members of provincial Parliament to support this private member’s bill.

She was a Canadian politician and businesswoman who served as the mayor of Mississauga, of course, from 1978 to 2014. But she was much more than that. She was an international celebrity. She was very well known all over, not just in Canada, but all over, in political circles in the world. She was first elected in 1978, but was the longest-serving mayor in Mississauga’s history. She served 36 years. Her supporters gave her the nickname Hurricane Hazel because of her outspoken political style.", "I saw an example of that outspoken political style. She was a fantastic speaker. Just a couple of weeks ago, at the Wealth One Bank of Canada grand opening at Le Parc in my riding—it was very interesting, because I’m just going to read a few of the speakers that were there: the Honourable Charles Sousa, Minister of Finance; Mayor Frank Scarpitti was on the list, but I didn’t actually see him, so he must have spoken at another reception there; Wealth One bank president and CEO Charles Lambert; vice-chair Daryl Yeo; founder and vice-chair Shenglin Xian; the Honourable John McCallum, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship; the Honourable Victor Oh, senator for the federal government; the Honourable Bing Xue, consul general of China; the Honourable Michael Chan, Minister of International Trade; and Hazel McCallion, as well as myself.", "Hazel McCallion, by far, was one of the most dynamic speakers there. I don’t want to insult myself or anybody else there, but she was just powerful. The room was very quiet, and she was very passionate. You could tell that she was just so happy for the first regulated Chinese-Canadian bank to have their grand opening in Canada.", "She was a professional hockey player in Montreal, and I’m from Montreal as well. I think she was very passionate about the Maple Leafs and continues to be passionate and cheer them on.", "A famous story in the news about Hazel is from April 2006, when there was a police standoff with a distraught man who was threatening to kill himself. This went on for five hours. You can imagine the stressful, difficult situation. Hazel McCallion, the mayor, appeared on the scene and demanded to the gentleman that he stand down so that the police, the paramedics, the fire personnel—everybody who was there—could get on and attend to more important matters. And the man did stand down. So there is the voice of authority. I think that sometimes it’s not just what you say; it’s how you say it that matters.", "I think that it’s very impressive to be here today, not just to talk about Hazel McCallion. I often talk about the Jewish community, which I’m part of and I represent in a lot of ways. The Jewish community likes to recognize people after they’re gone. They find it peculiar to name something after somebody or recognize somebody when they’re alive. But isn’t it nice to recognize somebody when they’re there to enjoy it? I think that it’s nice that we’re here today.", "I want to recall my own late mother, who got her CA when 500 people got their chartered accountant licence in Quebec in the late 1950s, and she was the only woman. She had a tough time of it because she was married, she was starting a family and she was pregnant, writing her exams. She recalls how the gentlemen, her future colleagues, were all smoking while writing the exams, even though she asked them not to. It was a difficult time for women.", "I think it’s hard for us to realize just how far we’ve come. We’ve all come a long way. I know the expression is, “You’ve come a long way, baby,” but we’re nobody’s baby, of course. And we really have come a long way. I think it’s important for us to recognize the women who were the trailblazers, not just Hazel McCallion but all the women who made it possible for us to be here today in this fantastic province, in this fantastic country, celebrating all the diversity of cultures and religions, but yes, also the gender equality that we really enjoy here today.", "I want to thank specifically, as I know other people have—but in case people watching at home don’t realize, our Speaker is female.

Some of our speakers have talked about what must it be like to follow an act like Hazel McCallion, so I have a story to add to that.", "Our current mayor, the fourth mayor in Mississauga’s history, Bonnie Crombie, who served with me as my overlapping member when she was the federal member in Mississauga–Streetsville, was elected in 2015 to succeed Hazel McCallion. Hazel, of course, kept coming to a lot of the functions after her term as mayor was over. One day, Bonnie showed up to a function. She was speaking to me, and I said, “What’s the matter?” She said, “I don’t know how to take this event that occurred just a short time ago.” I said, “Well, tell me about it.”", "She said, “Well, I showed up to an event, and I was running a little bit behind. I went up to the organizers and I said, ‘I’ve got a really tight schedule. Can we start the event on time?’” The gentleman who was organizing the event said to Mayor Crombie, “Well, we’re ready to start. We’re just waiting on the mayor.” Bonnie looked at them and said, “I’m here.” They said, “Not you. Hazel McCallion.” Bonnie was telling me this and, of course, I just collapsed in a heap of laughter. I said, “Bonnie, even you have to realize that’s a very funny story.”", "But that’s just the shadow that Hazel McCallion has cast over our city. It illustrates the reservoir of goodwill that a woman who was the mayor between 1978 and 2015 has left behind.", "A great deal of Hazel’s reputation was earned very early in perhaps her moment of trial by fire, which occurred during the Mississauga train derailment. When that particular train, which contained a number of cars containing liquid chlorine, derailed, there was the Mississauga evacuation, which is referred to, to this day, as the Mississauga miracle. There was no looting. There were no lives lost. The situation was cleaned up. Everybody returned to their homes and life continued.", "But during that time, I don’t think Hazel slept more than the occasional hour or two for nearly a week. She attended everything; she showed up everywhere. At that point, the legend of Hazel McCallion was firmly established. To Hazel’s credit, she said, “The reason I don’t put up signs, and the reason that I don’t conduct a re-election campaign, is people see who I am and where I am from election to election. And if they want to vote for me, they’re welcome to vote for me. If they don’t, they’re welcome not to.” As my colleague from Mississauga–Brampton South has pointed out, Hazel McCallion was elected time after time, with margins of victory in excess of 90% of the vote.", "Speaker, that’s what I’d like to add to this discussion here today. I know that one of my colleagues has a few points of his own to add." ],

Congratulations.", "I also wanted to say that I think we should commend the member from Mississauga–Brampton South, Amrit Mangat. She’s the first woman of South Asian background to be elected as an MPP in the provincial Legislature. So there’s a lot of firsts here. There’s the first female Deputy Speaker from beautiful Scarborough. We can go on.", "The thing about Hazel: I remember one time when I happened to be between, I should say, or with Hazel McCallion and Mel Lastman. They got into a bit of an argument about the subway at the time, whether North York should get the subway or they should extend the subway out to Mississauga. Anyway, those were two characters. There aren’t mayors like that anymore. It was quite an interesting debate.", "Hazel: We forget she’s from the Gaspé. We wonder why she was so resilient, so tough. Well, anybody that comes from Port-Daniel in the Gaspé—about 300 people there. So she came from the Gaspé to Montreal to Streetsville. I think I first met her when she was the mayor of Streetsville. Streetsville was eventually amalgamated into Mississauga. She came really from the grassroots.", "She never forgot ordinary people. That was what Hazel was all about. No matter whether she was with Prime Ministers, whether she was with dignitaries or business people, she treated everyone the same. Straight up, told it as it is—she spoke what was on her mind. Sometimes people say, “Oh, she’s pretty rough around the edges.” I say, “Yes.” She used to drive herself; she didn’t have a driver." ],

But Hazel made sure we knew it was on the map.", "She is a real credit to not only women, but I think she’s a really amazing Canadian. She really is a credit to this country. That’s why this bill is very appropriate: to recognize this day, to say thanks to Hazel for whatever she did—and she did so much—and what kind of role model she is to all the young girls and women out there that they’ve really got someone.

I’m very proud to say that I have the opportunity to serve alongside the first female Premier of Ontario, the Honourable Kathleen Wynne. As I have said earlier, there are many successful inspiring female role models, but today the focus is on Hazel.", "As my friend from Windsor–Tecumseh said, she’s a very popular leader.

Getting your driver’s licence is a rite of passage for many young Ontarians, especially in rural Ontario. Being able to own and drive a vehicle gives you the independence and mobility that allows you to seek employment wherever you please and take care of friends and family who can’t drive.", "Rural residents are particularly dependent on their vehicles and their licences. The closest grocery store could be 50 or 100 kilometres away, while the closest health facility is likely to be in a larger city such as Cornwall, Brockville or Ottawa. In rural Ontario, driving isn’t just a choice; it’s a necessity. Where I grew up in Lancaster township, the closest corner grocery store was over five kilometres away. My high school was 25 kilometres away and the nearest hospital was over 50 kilometres away. As you can see, driving a car was a necessity for my family, especially since the local corner grocery store has closed under this Liberal government’s reign, unable to survive the excessive regulations, taxes and fees.", "The Ministry of Transportation has the duty to ensure that Ontario’s roads are safe for all users. When someone’s health could make them an unsafe driver, medical professionals must take away their licence and notify the ministry. Public safety is everyone’s concern, and I doubt anyone in this chamber would debate a physician’s educated opinion about a patient’s fitness to control a vehicle. These suspensions are not permanent. They are just enforced until the MTO receives a physician’s report stating that the person is again capable of driving a vehicle safely.", "MTO, however, is slow and prone to mistakes when processing these reports. Over the years, my office and the offices of many of my colleagues have received many constituents’ complaints about the delay in getting their licences reinstated. The ministry’s response on all of our inquiries has always been to wait 30 business days and not bother inquiring about the file until that deadline has passed. It was disheartening to tell my constituents the news. For every suspended healthy driver caught in this artificially long wait time, there are stories of lost earnings, missed medical appointments, loss of employment and a very clear risk of financial hardship. My constituents have had enough, and we’ve launched a petition to fix this problem. I read that into the record just today.", "The petition followed a very simple principle: If it takes hours to suspend a licence, based on the physician’s advice, it shouldn’t take six weeks to take a physician’s advice to the contrary. My constituents asked for a reasonable time frame within which to deliver a reinstatement once the doctor has cleared the driver. We believe that is five business days. Such a time frame allows the ministry plenty of time to review the medical documents for completeness, despite it still being an inconvenience to the constituent, who would need to take a week of what is essentially unpaid leave.", "As soon as the petition was launched, a steady stream of frustrated residents in Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry came to my office and signed it. So far, there are over 300 signatures, and more are coming in every day. To our surprise, we managed to achieve almost immediate success. The ministry immediately changed its tone when dealing with the medical review cases, assuring us and constituents that the average processing time was indeed decreasing. All of this after being told, just before the petition, to not bother calling until six weeks have passed.", "Speaker, it shouldn’t take the intervention of a member’s office or public frustration to boil over into a petition to prod a public service to actually work better for us. I cannot see how a system so stubbornly rigid one day can improve overnight, coincidentally following the recent release of a petition demanding better service from the medical review section.", "Before our petition was launched, the medical review section had also indicated to some constituents who had had to submit additional documents that they would be credited with some waiting time they had actually had to endure. This was as clear an indication as any that the 30-business-day delay wasn’t a matter of backlogs or justified review time; it was an artificially imposed and enforced deadline. This is why it’s important for this Legislature to demand that the Ministry of Transportation make a clear, measurable commitment to serving our drivers better.", "In response to the petition I have presented, the Minister of Transportation stated that the division was meeting or exceeding the service guarantee, meaning that they were reviewing files on a shorter time scale. I am pleased that the ministry recognized that there was a problem in the medical review section and took steps, whichever they were, to address at least part of the delay, however small. The issue, however, has not gone away. Ontarians deserve to be served promptly and efficiently by their government. Our residents and businesses already pay through the nose for this government’s spending, despite seeing front-line and essential public services becoming less and less accessible.", "Medical reviews of driver’s licence suspensions are an essential service. Without prompt and guaranteed service in this area, residents of rural Ontario and all workers who depend on their driver’s licence in order to work are at risk of losing their jobs. Long and unnecessary suspensions cause businesses to lose money and workers to lose earnings. What is a temporary suspended worker to tell his employer? As things stand today, workers, owner-operators and caregivers must tell those who depend on them that they need alternative arrangements for six weeks.", "The minister can parade his “meeting and exceeding” talking points all he wishes. However, it doesn’t change the insensitive stance taken by this department. The stance boils down to, “You’re out of a licence for six weeks, period. Consider any day less than that a gift from us.” Speaker, good and prompt service isn’t for the government to bestow upon us, akin to a ruler’s bounty for their people. We have, through our taxes and fees, given this government the funds necessary to deliver the public services that a province such as Ontario could be proud of. Instead of spending that responsibly, the current government has caused waste and a culture of entitlement to spread through all departments. Thirty business days to take a physician’s advice is not a service, especially when it only takes hours to take the same advice to pull a licence in the first place.", "Here are a couple of examples of the way the medical review section has failed my constituents:", "—a high incidence of wait times in excess of even the 30-business-day time frame.", "—Numerous constituents mention that medical reports are lost by the ministry, with this situation only rectified through our office’s intervention.", "—Constituents were given conflicting information by the ministry on whether their licences were suspended or not, in one case giving a person the impression their licence would be suspended in a few weeks, and then sending the same person a letter telling them that the licence was already suspended. This is irresponsible and can make an unwilling criminal of a perfectly innocent and safe driver. It’s just not justifiable.", "This motion is about a simple principle: transparent, accountable and prompt service for all Ontario residents. The Ministry of Transportation is already processing driver licence reinstatements faster than the stated 30-day service guarantee. This is a question of service. When Ontarians who depend on their driver’s licence tell those who depend on them that they’ll have to wait, I want them to be able to say confidently that they will be out of a licence for just a few days, rather than six weeks. The unjustifiably long service guarantee isn’t just an artificial number concocted within the ministry for internal use; it’s a real source of frustration for all those caught up in the process. It is the only reference drivers can give their clients, their employers and their loved ones. Since the ministry is already able to process these files faster, it should improve the service guarantee to reflect this new, improved situation.", "Ontarians are ready to endure a week-long inconvenience for the sake of strong public safety. Telling them that they must wait six weeks is just insensitive and cruel. So I’m asking this government and this chamber to make a commitment to service—service to those who elect us, to those who, through their hard work and dedication, build businesses, innovate, work, raise families and allow this government to function.", "The PC caucus’s and my message to Ontario drivers is clear: We are here for you. We are with you. We know you wish to be safe, and we want you to keep it that way.", "My message to the government is even clearer: Commit to serving the people of this province and commit to giving them better service than the unjustifiably slow one you guarantee today. Despite being able to deliver better, you can deliver faster. Be proud of it, and make that a new, better public standard. You have nothing to lose." ],

I know that Grant, Cindy and Vicky are at the constituency office right now. They’re the ones that deal with the people that come in every single day with a variety of issues. This is one that they were quite excited to actually help out and provide me with some background as far as what they’ve been hearing through the constituency office. Like I said, my staff have been working with this for a very long time.", "As it stands now, MTO has a 30-day review policy. However, in most cases, MTO reviews the client’s file towards the end of that 30-day deadline. What that means is, it doesn’t matter. You come in with the information. “Thank you very much. It goes on top of the file, and I’ll look at it in 30 days.” So you’ve lost 30 days there.", "Basically, if you could give this five-day guarantee that you’ll be able to look at that information and reinstate that licence to that individual—that’s what we’re looking for, and that’s what the member is calling for, which is common sense, something that we should be using a little bit more in this Legislature.", "The MTO will require further information, delaying it again. Thus, mailing it out to the individual, by the time he gets his mail, he has to reset another doctor’s appointment. A further delay is happening because—guess what?—in northern Ontario, in order to see your family doctor, you’re looking at anywhere between, if you’re lucky, a month to a month and a half.", "Once the client has obtained the requested information and it is submitted to MTO by themselves or by their doctor, a new 30-day waiting period begins. So continues the vicious circle, and it just goes on and on and on, and the delay happens, and delay and delay and delay.", "In the meantime, this guy, this individual, or this woman is losing an opportunity for a job and is going through drastic hardship. Their income is not coming in and they’re facing some really tough financial hardship.", "My office has received several calls from transport drivers, bus drivers and couriers regarding their suspended licences due to medical forms or reports having to be reviewed by MTO. In most cases, these individuals are months without a licence, which directly impacts their work and income and, in some cases, has led to job loss because of delays in the review process. We have had several constituents contact our office because they have been without a licence for over 12 months due to the current MTO medical review process.", "My constituency staff have been dealing with one case in particular, where a constituent approached my office for assistance after his driver’s licence was suspended because his medical report contained a medication that, in some cases, is used for the treatment of epilepsy. He didn’t have epilepsy. MTO made the assumption that he was epileptic and suspended his licence, when in fact this medication was prescribed to him for migraine headaches. To date, his licence is still suspended until the doctor submits proof that his patient does not have epilepsy. In order to satisfy MTO, the doctor is contemplating sending him for an MRI as proof that he doesn’t have epilepsy, thus further delaying the reinstatement of his driver’s licence.", "Can you imagine the time and effort? And mind you that these doctors aren’t readily available for review in our communities. As well, having to resort to referring his patients for unnecessary testing is a waste of health care resources and leaves the constituent unemployed until the matter is finally resolved.", "These are only some of the cases that we deal with. A gentleman who had a problem with his eyes was required to go to the optometrist. He went to the optometrist and sent in the information. The information came back. MTO wasn’t satisfied with the tests that he took. They wanted him to go for an Optomap. They sent him back. He got that test done, and sent it in. In the meantime, Madam Speaker, we’re talking about 90 days now. This individual lost out on a perfect opportunity in order to get the employment that he was looking for. It created some hardship. Basically, it’s unnecessary.", "I wholeheartedly support the member’s motion as it’s presented, and I hope that we can actually deal with this so that a lot of our constituency offices—every single one of us in this room knows that this is an issue and knows how we could tackle this to handle it. I hope that we have struck an ear on the other side of the table so that we can actually address this problem, because it is one that is bureaucratic.

In fact, we have the second-safest roads in all of North America.", "I know that our government’s mandatory reporting process for physicians and optometrists is a very important way that we are working to ensure that our roads remain safe.

That’s very impressive.", "In order to be fair to all drivers, the ministry reviews these reports on a first-come, first-served basis. It’s clear that this process is meeting customers’ needs while maintaining the important balance between road safety and ensuring Ontarians’ mobility.", "As I mentioned earlier, our government’s record on road safety is clear. In June 2015, our government passed Bill 31. With the passage of this bill, we’re committed to making our roads even safer by expanding medical reporting requirements, clarifying mandatory and discretionary reporting requirements in future regulation, and setting out what specific driver information must be provided on mandatory forms.", "I know that members on both sides of this House value these commitments, as Bill 31, the Making Ontario’s Roads Safer Act, was passed with all-party support—so we did have their support on this particular bill; they know that it’s important as well.", "Speaker, I would also like to take some time to talk to you about the ongoing work that we’re doing to continually strengthen the medical review process.

However, we’re also aware that work is being undertaken to ensure this process continues to meet Ontarians’ customer service expectations for many years to come. This work includes improving medical reporting forms; working with staff to maximize the use of technology for faster, more efficient case processing; and introducing electronic medical reporting that’s going to see physicians submitting information electronically, allowing some forms to be processed automatically.", "It’s very important that all members of this House know how the government applies medical standards. Our approach is balanced, using medical standards outlined under the Highway Traffic Act; national standards created by the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators; and through consultation with doctors and nurse practitioners for more complex cases. For such cases, the ministry has the support of its medical advisory committee, which is made up of 19 physicians who have a variety of medical specializations.", "It’s clear that our province’s medical professionals are at the heart of this process.

Today’s motion calls on the ministry to institute a five-business-day service guarantee for reinstating drivers’ licences following the submission of a medical review highlighting no issues that would warrant a continued suspension.

Since that date I had no income at all.”", "He goes on to say, “I heard nothing further until mid-February, when I called them.", "“The ministry representative advised me that it had indeed been 39 business days since they had received my doctor’s report but that they were extremely busy and there was a backlog.", "“I finally got a letter on March 9 informing me that in order to make a decision regarding my driver’s licence, that I would have to go for an assessment.", "“The earliest date I could book was April 1, 2015, and the cost for the three-hour assessment is $575.", "“One last footnote: I was advised last week that the company I have worked for for the last 15 years has been sold and the new owners are bringing their own employees with them so my services will no longer be needed.”", "And if that last note wasn’t hard enough to take, it only gets worse when you hear the conclusion that, after my office got involved and had the gentleman’s assessment walked over to have his review seen immediately, he was approved to go back on the road just like that. That’s an eight-month journey that could have been much less if the MTO had heeded the doctor’s assessment in October.", "Now, quickly, I just want to commend Alanna Tersenie. Alanna, as many of you will know, works with MPPs’ offices to help constituents when they’re in a driver’s licence predicament, like many of them are. She does outstanding work. She is extremely responsive and does a ton of files, no doubt across the province. So I want to make special mention of her and thank her for her years of service to Ontario and Ontario motorists, and especially to the many MPPs’ offices she helps. Alanna Tersenie, thank you very much.", "With that, I want to again commend my colleague the member from Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry for bringing this important initiative forward." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s always a pleasure to rise on behalf of my constituents of Windsor West, and I’m pleased to be able to rise and speak to the motion today, motion 7, driver’s licence reinstatement.", "I’d like to thank the member from Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry for bringing the motion forward. It’s a very important topic. I know it has affected many people in my riding and across the province.", "Several members have already spent some time providing a summary of the motion, so I don’t want to go into too much detail and repeat what so many others have already talked about.", "I just have some key points to touch on in the five minutes I have left. The motion calls for a five-business-day service guarantee for reinstating drivers’ licences for anyone who has had their licence suspended for medical reasons. In order for that to happen, you have to have a physician certify that. First, they have to see that the person is medically unfit to drive to have the licence suspended and then, to have it reinstated, a physician has to certify that whatever the particular issue was has since been rectified and the person is now again fit to drive.", "I think everybody in this room knows that at times it is necessary for someone to have their licence suspended for medical reasons. It’s not their fault, by any means, but we are all susceptible to illnesses and for some people those illnesses mean they should not be on the road. Safety should always be paramount on the road.", "I think it’s important to note that when somebody is having their licence suspended for medical reasons, that can be done very quickly, which is a good thing. Sometimes it’s a matter of a few hours for the process to take place, to have somebody’s licence suspended. Again, that’s good, because we don’t want somebody on the road who is not safe being there, either for themselves or for those around them.", "But unfortunately, when a physician, a professional, has since said that somebody is now medically fit to drive—so they’re okay; whatever the issue is has been rectified—the process is not as quick or as timely as it is to take the licence away. I think that’s a big problem for many people, for many reasons. Many of them were discussed today. We’ve heard stories of people who have to drive for work. That’s their livelihood. I’m not just talking about getting to work, which is an issue, but they actually drive for a living. For it to take as long as it does in some cases for them to get that licence back, they end up losing their employment. They lose their income, which is really unfair.", "If there’s a process in place to remove a licence as quickly as a few hours, there should be a process in place to get someone their licence back in a reasonable time frame. And I think what the member from Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry—the five business days—is asking for and suggesting is not unreasonable. If they can work so quickly to take it away, they should be able to work fairly quickly to reinstate the driver’s licence.", "There are a few of my colleagues who have spoken on different occasions about this particular issue. They’ve highlighted that it can take up to 30 days or more in some cases for drivers’ licences to be reinstated. In fact, in 2014-15, Ontario Ombudsman André Marin received 243 complaints about the ministry’s medical review section, up from 141 the previous year, which is a 72% increase. And I’m sure that there are many people in the province who don’t know that there is a process in place for them to even go to the Ombudsman to complain when there’s an issue, so this number could be even larger.", "The process as it is currently administered really undervalues how many people—I’m going to speak specifically to my community of Windsor. It understates the need for people to drive for their career, for the family or even for pleasure. We have a beautiful waterfront, and people like to get out on Riverside Drive to drive the waterfront and take in the sights.", "It’s important to point out that in Windsor, we don’t just drive vehicles. We actually build award-winning vehicles that create many jobs for people in the area. So clearly, driving and automotive jobs are very important for us. Many people depend on having a licence. That’s their livelihood. That’s how they get to work. That’s how they make the money to pay these ridiculous hydro bills. The cost of driving has increased incredibly, which is a totally separate issue, but we don’t need to put any more burden on drivers.", "Just to wrap up with my 27 seconds—I thought I’d have a hard time doing six minutes; the time has gone in no time—I just want to touch on what the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Transportation, the member from Kitchener Centre, said, which is that the government never compromises the safety of our roads. I would just like to point out to her on that particular statement—and I hope the members on the other side are listening—that if you really, really believe that statement that you never compromise the safety of our roads, then you really should honour your promise to widen Highway 3, because we’ve recently had another accident." ],

The riding touches the northwest corner of my riding, so welcome to the Scarborough riding as an MPP. I look forward to working with you on areas of mutual interest concerning Scarborough. I also represent Pickering, but that’s all going to change later. Anyway, I digress. Thank you, Speaker, for indulging me there.", "I want to thank the member from Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry for bringing this forward. He was my critic when I was first in cabinet as the Minister of Consumer Services. I really enjoy being on House duty Thursday afternoon to hear debates of PMBs generally, but I’ve always appreciated my good working relationship with him on issues concerning consumer services at that time, and I enjoy hearing the debate as well.", "We’ve heard about a number of things related to this motion, and I think the debate here has been quite constructive. You have heard from the government members about some of the statistics, including that MTO is currently meeting or exceeding the 30-day customer service standard. They’re processing 90% of cases within 10 days, so that’s pretty fantastic. It doesn’t mean that there isn’t room to improve, of course.", "I want to touch on something related to this. I had a constituent involved in a case similar to this—a very special constituent. That constituent is my husband. Shortly after I became the Minister of Consumer Services—literally a few days after—I got a call. I was getting briefed, as you do when you get a new portfolio, and I got a call. It was my husband, and he said, “I think I’ve had a heart attack.” I was like, “Oh my gosh! Where are you? What’s happening?” He was on the train. Of course, he didn’t stay in Kingston, where he was when he first suspected this. He decided to get on the train to come home because he was too stubborn. I love him, but he shouldn’t have done that.", "Anyway, we got him into care at Rouge Valley hospital, at the cardiac centre there. It’s a regional cardiac centre. It’s been there for about 20 years. They provide fantastic service. My husband had never had heart problems before. So in he went. It was late in the day, so I think it was the next day they did the scopy thing—I forget what you call that kind of surgery—and he had a stent put in. Then they found that there were two blocks, so he needed to have two stents put in.", "Then, of course, once he was stabilized—and he did quite well after that—the doctor talked to us about the driver’s licence situation. I’m sharing this story because, on top of the rules—and I’m sensing that we all agree that if a doctor says someone is not fit to drive, then that licence must be suspended ASAP. The communication is really important because here I am in the hospital. I’m a new minister. We’ve never had these issues before, so it was important that the doctor talk to him and to me and our family to make sure he wouldn’t drive, right? Because sometimes it’s overwhelming, especially if it’s a new medical situation and you don’t know what’s going on. It’s very important that that be reinforced, that he should not drive and that I and the kids should make sure he doesn’t drive.", "My husband was compliant and he needed to be away from work and to take it easy for a number of weeks. I appreciate that some people recover very quickly from a medical situation, and I appreciate that they’re going to want to get driving again as soon as their doctor clears them. But in this case, Stephen needed to be off work.", "But I really want to emphasize the communication piece because there’s so much information, when you have a sudden medical crisis like that, about what to do, what the next steps are, what your follow-up appointment is—and, by the way, don’t drive. As I said, he didn’t get medical help right away when he probably should have. Thankfully, he did listen to the doctor, who said, “You shouldn’t drive,” and the doctor talked to me to use me as a reinforcer to make sure he didn’t drive. So that’s really, really important.", "I know the MTO is working to improve their processes wherever they can. I understand they’re improving medical reporting forms; they’re improving the use of technology; they’re introducing electronic medical reporting that will see physicians submitting information to the ministry electronically, allowing some forms to be processed automatically. These kinds of efforts need to be ongoing—we need to keep up with the technology—but, as said by all members of the House, safety is job one when it comes to our roads. It’s not just the safety of the patients; it’s the safety of everybody who is on the road.", "As I said, in my experience the communication piece was really, really important. I’m pleased to see that the service standards are high and that MTO is working to make those standards even higher.", "I think this is a good bill that has been brought forward and that is worthy of consideration. I again thank the member opposite. He’s a great member and he was a great critic when I was in consumer services. In this case, he’s looking out for the consumer, the patient, but also the consumers of our highways and roads, to make sure that we’re all safe and that we minimize the risk of injury or worse to us when we’re on the roads, if someone is on the road who shouldn’t be there.", "Thank you very much, Speaker, for allowing me to share my story." ],

I want to recognize everybody in the optometry, ophthalmology and medical community for all the fantastic work they do in terms of assessing people for their driver’s licence permits when there are medical concerns.", "It’s much more difficult, I think, than people here sometimes appreciate, because you can imagine the absolute hysteria from people when they’re being told that they’re going to lose their ability to drive. Oftentimes they have driven to the appointment, and you’re so uncomfortable with them driving that you really have to advise them to have somebody come not only to pick them up but to pick up their car.", "Oftentimes, it’s something very simple like cataract surgery, where, once they’ve had the implants, they’re able to see like that. Sometimes two days after surgery or a day after surgery, the doctor feels they’re safe to drive again. Yet the medical review committee of non-medical professionals—let’s face it; they’re trained to just analyze what the medical professionals are recommending—seem to drag their feet.", "I think that’s what we’re discussing here today. We’re not discussing public safety; we’re not discussing who should possibly lose their driver’s licence or who should get their driver’s licence back. We’re just saying that, once people have passed all the criteria necessary to get their driver’s licence reinstated—not just so that they can drive for leisure, but so that they can drive for a living, so that they can drive their kids to their programs—once they are in the clear, why should it take up to six weeks for them to actually get their driver’s licence back?", "I think there are many people who see colleagues at work who have lost their driver’s licence for so long, should have had it back, still haven’t gotten it back and maybe even lost their job. It makes them afraid to go for medical checkups. That’s what really concerns me here today. We should be doing everything we can to encourage people to go for medical checkups. Yet, when they’re hearing from people that it took so long and it was so difficult to get their driver’s licence back, they’re stressed out. They don’t go for their medical checkups. They can be having health problems that could be dealt with in a timely way and aren’t dealt with until it’s an emergency room visit, and it could be that the cost to the medical system is actually much higher than if they would have gone in the first place.", "People are stressed out when they lose their licence, and we all know what happens when people have stress. They can have medical problems—and dire medical problems, even strokes and heart attacks—because of the foot-dragging by the review committee. With electronic health records now, and emails—not just faxes anymore, Madam Speaker, but with all the electronic communications devices that we have now—there’s really no reason for it to take six weeks for somebody who has been cleared medically to get their driver’s licence back.", "We’re hearing all about the lack of bus drivers here in Toronto. How many of those bus drivers that could be driving for us maybe just haven’t gotten their licence back because they have had cataract surgery in July and they thought by September they’ll have their driver’s licence back, and maybe the doctor wasn’t able to assess them until August? Perhaps they were perfectly capable of driving the school bus beginning in September, but they weren’t able to because they didn’t have their suspension taken off their licence.", "I think that there could be a better system in place. Perhaps people don’t have to actually send in their physical driver’s licence and have a new one sent back to them. Perhaps we could have a system—I certainly would have been willing to have a locked box in a locked room with people’s driver’s licences in it, holding it for them until I got the all-clear from the ministry to physically give it back to them. Why should we have to actually suspend their licence, take it away and print them a new licence?", "I’m hoping that we’re going to have all-party support here today for this motion. I think it’s important, and I think that it’s something that resonates across the province in every sector, in every demographic." ],

I’ve seen cases where we’ve had people come into the office where they’ve gone into emergency, their licence has been pulled, they see the specialist and then the standard is something else. But now they’re into the 30 days.", "We’ve had people come in where the documents have gotten lost. Normally they just tell us to wait 30 days, so it’s hard to tell that these documents are lost until the 30 days pass and we’re allowed to really dig into the case. Now, in one case, they said, “Well, we lost the documents. It was two weeks so we’ll give them credit for the two weeks so they only have to wait four weeks.”", "The doctor has given certification. This is not a safety issue. This is the person that actually believed it wasn’t safe. They’ve now said, “Yes, it is safe to drive.” We have livelihoods—we had a truck driver that came in. He was at the point of losing his job, and he was certified as okay to drive. This case should never have lost it in the first place, but he did and he was subject to the 30 days.", "Then we have the issue of the office closures. When people go, they have to get there. They have to have a relative get them there because they have no licence. Really, when you look at it, what are we doing? Maybe, possibly, the process is not working today. Maybe they have to modify it. But in this day of electronic document transfer, surely we can get a doctor to sign something off. If they’re concerned about the document, have it re-sent the same day and get the service that our residents expect. When you are looking at somebody’s livelihood, I think it’s not too much to ask that we look at trying to do a five-business-day service. Hopefully, they’ll be able to beat that." ],

I’m so gung-ho to get started on this particular debate, because it’s something that’s near and dear to all of us. It’s with regard to Ontario’s food production. It’s Bill 4, An Act to amend the Pesticides Act, or as it’s better known to stakeholders I’ve met with, the Supporting Agricultural Experts in their Field Act.", "Before I really get started into the debate, I want to recognize the numerous stakeholders that I’ve spoken with. I truly appreciate their time and their constructive feedback. I spoke to the Ontario Beekeepers’ Association; OABA, the Ontario Agri Business Association; Ontario Soil and Crop Improvement Association; CCAs; Ontario Institute of Agrologists; Ontario Federation of Agriculture; Grain Farmers of Ontario; the Christian farmers federation; and numerous county federations of agriculture, as well as soil and crop members. I would be remiss if I didn’t recognize that we’ve played phone tag with the Ecological Farmers Association of Ontario, but I truly hope I can get speaking to Ali in the near future.", "In addition to all of those organizations and stakeholders, I want to give a special shout-out to a few more people. First of all, Susan Fitzgerald of the certified crop advisers, as well as Clare Kinlin have been a tremendous help in helping drill down and speak specifically to how we can make regulations work. I’ll get to that in a second, Madam Speaker.", "In addition to that, I’d like to recognize and welcome to the House Don McCabe, president of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. Thank you very much for coming down on a Thursday afternoon. You and I go way back, and I really appreciate your commitment to Ontario agriculture, your sage advice and dogged determination to make sure we get legislation right so Ontario farmers can be the best they can be. Thank you for being here today.", "Secondly, I’d like to introduce to the House Dave Ferguson. Dave has made the trek as well from Lambton county. He is involved as the local Lambton county president of the Lambton Federation of Agriculture. Dave is an example of the amazing stewards we have across this province. When I say stewards, I mean stewards of the land. Dave recognizes the importance of creating pollinator habitat. Some of the members in this House this afternoon had a chance to meet him earlier today at lunch. He very proudly—and I know I’m not supposed to have props—but he very proudly showed what he’s doing on his farm, how he’s taking acres out of production in order to facilitate and foster proper pollinator habitats. I congratulate him and his wife, Gabrielle, who is very much an important pillar in the agriculture industry as well, for that.", "I’d be remiss if I didn’t say that there should be a social responsibility that the entire province of Ontario holds when we have farmers willing to go the distance to create habitats, such as for pollinators. I thank you for all you do. You lead by example.", "With that, I’d like to get started by saying I want to be very clear in this debate. It’s important to recognize and celebrate the fact that in this particular issue that we’re addressing today, with regard to pollinator health and moving forward to ensure our farmers can be as productive as possible, it’s important that we recognize the agri-food sector as a whole has taken great strides to understand the issues and the hard winters and compounding elements that contributed to a low bee population a couple of years ago.", "They understand the issue, they’ve done the research, they’ve created a pollinator health plan, and they’ve educated farmers on how they can be the best stewards of the land. Collectively, the industry has moved forward, truly making the current regulations that are on the books unnecessary.", "But given that the regulations are now in place, I want to be perfectly clear with everyone in the House today that I did not introduce Bill 4 with the intention of challenging the restricted use that has been placed on neonicotinoids, but rather to take steps in making a difficult situation more workable for the men and women of our agri-food industry.", "As you may be aware, beginning on August 31, 2017, subsection 8.2(8) of Ontario regulation 63/09 will be amended to prohibit any professional pest adviser that “derives a financial benefit from a person who manufactures or sells a class 12 pesticide or a pesticide that is used to treat a seed so that it becomes a class 12 pesticide” from performing a pest assessment. We’ll get into what that really means a little bit later, but for us who know what that means, the reason for this change deeply concerns me.", "Throughout the consultation process that I undertook over the last couple of months, it was suggested that the change to the regulations was being enacted based on an unfounded notion that professional pest advisers who work for a seed and crop and/or crop input company will automatically want to sell the treated seed because it costs more. Well, guess what? A treated bag of seed adds no more than approximately $3 a bag in price, and in some instances, it’s as low as 80 cents—hardly a financial windfall for anyone looking to make a big profit.", "In fact, the Elgin Federation of Agriculture wrote of their findings on this matter, saying:", "“This regulation will seriously curtail pest adviser services currently provided by CCAs employed by the private sector to crop producers, based solely on implied pecuniary or conflict of interest directly related to the distribution of class 12 pesticides. Interestingly, this implied charge of pecuniary or conflict of interest has not been demonstrated nor recognized to be of similar concern with respect to other competing crop input products.", "“In principle, Ontario regulation 139/15 ... implies the existence of moral hazard where evidence of such behaviour has not been demonstrated.”", "You know, it’s interesting, because the Ontario Federation of Agriculture has also flagged this with the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change directly. In their letter of September 15 to me, Don McCabe wrote, “Many engineers, accountants, dentists, lawyers and other certified professionals provide advice to clients, despite being employed by or affiliated with a larger firm.”", "Speaker, why does this government feel that limitations need to be applied to one particular body of professionals, and one that has never had a documented case of conflict to boot? That question really has to be asked here.", "If this is indeed the basis for such a change, it’s disappointing and highly unfounded. In fact, just yesterday, the Minister of Agriculture said in his response to my question on the matter that his own government is reviewing the workability of these particular regulations and questions. While I appreciate that very much, it says to me that you realize that there’s a problem and you need to look into it a little bit more. So I’m glad we’re doing it collectively today during the debate.", "There are two more important factors as to why this particular regulation and action limiting professional pest advisers is detrimental to the soybean and corn producers of Ontario.", "First of all, the changes to the definition of a professional pest adviser will have negative implications for farmers. Farmers will be forced to end the effective professional partnerships they’ve established for perhaps dozens of years with the experts who understand their unique crop needs, soil types, field conditions and growing seasons like nobody else.", "As the Niagara South Federation of Agriculture points out in their letter of support, “Many farmers work closely with CCAs at their local supplier, or with the seed companies of their choice, and have developed a trusting working relationship with them. It is likely that farmers will want to continue to work with CCAs that they know and trust.”", "The Essex County Federation of Agriculture also shared their concerns with me, saying, “Farmers establish a familiarity and working relationship with their CCA over time. Legislating who they work with is truly unnecessary. Limiting employment opportunities of the already few certified crop advisers would just be another burden of regulations on an agricultural industry as a whole.”", "Speaker, Bill 4 seeks to allow these relationships to continue to flourish, and it would be a shame if the politics in here caused them to die out in the field.", "Secondly, according to the Ontario Certified Crop Advisor Association and the Ontario Institute Of Agrologists, as of December 15 there were 538 crop advisers, or CCAs, and 30 professional agrologists, or PAgs, licensed and willing to conduct pesticide assessments in Ontario. However, with the implementation in this particular reg of this particular exclusionary clause, the number of professional pest advisers throughout Ontario will be reduced to only 80 qualified advisers.", "For reference, I would be nervous in the north, because that leaves just two professional pest advisers to serve all of Ontario. That’s a shame, Speaker, and it should not be allowed. In fact, on September 11, I received a letter from the Glengarry Federation of Agriculture with concerns about the reduction of PPAs this change would bring about. They said, “As far as we have been able to determine, there are all of four individuals that would meet the criteria that is set out” in the current regulation. Furthermore, it has been disclosed to our federation that at least two out of the four, for their own personal reasons, will not be conducting pest assessments for area producers.” The regulations are not working, Speaker. Bill 4 is a sincere attempt to make them workable.", "I want to go on and reflect a little bit more about what farmers in eastern Ontario are saying. They’ve been very clear in letting me know that eastern Ontario farmers will be at an even greater disadvantage than farmers in the rest of the province.", "I have to share with you that Bill 4 also addresses the need to let summer students conduct assessments independent of their employers. We also need to recognize that the assessments as they’re defined today do not—the methodology doesn’t make sense. We should just meet and use already existing OMAFRA standards in the Field Crop Protection Guide." ],

On top of that, we’ve had a collapse in a lot of agriculture prices.", "I would be remiss if I didn’t say that one thing the government needs to do is take the cap off the Risk Management Program, because otherwise you’re going to be in a position where you are going to have to have ad hoc programs. That was a good program. It was a great program, but right now it doesn’t really work because it’s not bankable, as it was designed to be, because of the gap. I would urge the minister, while he’s here, to think about doing that. It’s something that needs to be done.", "This whole thing came about because of the neonicotinoid pesticide. I’m not going to go into the whole history of neonics, but I admit I have used neonics on my farm. The stuff that we used before—I grew a lot of canola—was very harmful, even to the farmer, so we used neonics a lot because it was a lot safer.", "Neonics are a pesticide, so if they are used incorrectly, there are bad consequences. Farmers recognize that. They had a problem with air seeders and they fixed it. That was very proactive. I think the farming community is very willing to be proactive. They’ve shown that. Mr. Ferguson is good example of creating bee habitat and generally trying to work with regulators to make sure that the system works for everyone.", "Deep down, farmers know that if you overuse any type of herbicide or pesticide, eventually it will lose its use.

Her bill is a testament to her compassion and knowledge of our farming communities and what they need to be successful in today’s regulation-heavy business environment. Just two years ago, she received unanimous consent for her motion to add agri-food to the province’s grade 9 and 10 guidance and career education curriculum.", "As she so clearly stated, we’re debating a bill today that would save the jobs of Ontario’s 600 licensed certified crop advisers—also known as CCAs—and 30 professional agrologists. These are the experts who help to guide crop production and nutrient management, identify diseases, pests and problem weeds, and work with farmers to find solutions so they can plant their crops and grow our food.", "Bill 4 is an important bill. If passed, it would reverse the path of destruction that this government is looking to carve through our farming communities. As you’re all now aware, the government has proposed regulation 63 under the Pesticides Act, which would change the definition of a professional pest adviser. Sadly, the government did so with no stakeholder consultation, or consideration of the impact on the sector.", "For one, the government’s regulation 63 threatens to reduce the number of professional pest advisers to 80 from the current 600 and bring the sector to a crawl. Under the proposal, farmers won’t be able to access pest advisers and thus won’t access the products they need to grow their crops—no crops, no food. It’s unconscionable that the government would make such a drastic change, a reduction without consulting the agricultural community.", "Secondly, the government’s regulation would also limit who the farmers can work with by eliminating qualified crop advisers because of their employment with certain manufacturers or retailers. Limiting the farmers’ access to crop advisers at a time when there are already few advisers in the field, and limiting the crop advisers’ employment opportunities, will be two big burdens of regulation on the agricultural industry as a whole and will negatively impact the agricultural sector across the board.", "I’m puzzled. One moment, this government is quick to boost, “Our farms are overflowing with nutritious and delicious food,” and the next moment, they slap our farmers with ludicrous regulations, such as regulation 63. Clearly, our Liberal colleagues don’t understand Ontario’s agri-food sector.", "We have almost 80,000 farmers, who generate 160,000 jobs by farming a total of 3.6 million hectares of cropland with 125 different types of crops and livestock. This is a $14-billion industry. Why can’t this government understand that farmers are real business people? Farmers are effective, capable and successful business people. In many cases, they have to be even more flexible and creative as they’re contending with Mother Nature. I applaud them and how resilient and entrepreneurial they are. The government should start treating them as such and be a supporter rather than an obstacle.", "Don’t legislate who our farmers can work with. It’s excessive and unnecessary. Don’t cut off access to the products and expert services that they need to do their job, but give them the tools and resources they need to succeed. Clearly, great challenges stand between the government’s idea and reality on regulation 63.", "I myself receive a lot of feedback from local farmers, like Murray Caswell from Meaford. I enjoy a good working relationship with the farming community in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound.

  "text" : [ "I don’t know if I should say it’s a privilege to speak to Bill 2, but I will be speaking to Bill 2 today. I think it’s important that this House be engaged fully on the debate on Bill 2.", "We heard from the minister yesterday in his leadoff debate that although it’s been tabled and we have the text of it, the minister intends on transforming the bill significantly at committee after second reading, if it’s passed—a very, might I say, unconventional statement. I’ll get into that a little bit later.", "There are three elements of this bill that I think need to be sufficiently ventilated and discussed: (1) is what I would call the abuse of process that has gone on with Bill 2; (2) the cash-for-access elements which motivated and triggered the writing of Bill 2; and (3) the consequences should it be adopted, either in its present form or in the transformed form that the minister spoke of yesterday.", "Let me just start off by saying this. We understand cash-for-access was the motivation here. We also understand that law, law-making, law-abiding and the rule of law require everybody to have a moral compass that can define and distinguish between right and wrong, that can define and distinguish between vice and virtue. We saw, during the cash-for-access scandal, that this government has no moral compass. If it does have a moral compass, it is spinning wildly out of control. Really, the only conscience that appears to be present is what is good for the Liberal government, what is good for the Liberal government coffers.", "Let me just go back to the process. I want to start by reading a short passage from a former Chief Justice of the High Court of Justice of Ontario, James McRuer. Now, just briefly: “The theory underlying democratic government is that when legislators make the law, the rights of the individual will be safeguarded through public debate and public vote in the Legislature.” He goes on: “When the judges administer justice, the civil rights of the individual will be safeguarded by the independence and wisdom of the judges.”", "Going back to that first part, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Justice spells it out, and it’s intuitive to all of us that public interest is safeguarded through debate. Of course, to debate, one must have the text of the legislation in front of them so they know what the debate is.", "Here, we have heard from the minister yesterday that he plans to substantially transform this bill, not here at second reading but after second reading, after the bill has gone to committee hearings. And then, at the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill, he plans on amending this. Now, of course, that precludes and prevents anybody in this Legislature from debating either the principles of the bill or the merits, if the text is not available—astonishing.", "Now, keep in mind that this bill did go to first reading committee hearings. I commend the government for doing that, because at first reading committee, we had the opportunity to look at all aspects of election fundraising and bring in amendments. We had that opportunity. Amendments were put forward, amendments were adopted, and it was brought back. But prorogation happened in the intermission, and the government still brought back the amended bill from committee at first reading.", "Now they’re saying, “Dismiss everything that the committee did at first reading. We’re going to bring in new, transformative and dramatic amendments beyond the debate at clause-by-clause considerations.” Speaker, this is, as I said, astonishing. I don’t know what words we can use.", "But let me just go back, for all members’ understanding, to the House of Commons Procedure and Practice by O’Brien and Bosc, on page 712. I’ll read a few short passages for people’s understanding of the legislative process here that we’re engaged in.", "“The examination and enactment of legislation are often regarded as the most significant task of Parliament”—the most significant. The examination and enactment—“examination” is a key word here.", "“But what exactly is the legislative process? There are those who have defined it as a structured series of actions whereby a legislative proposal is examined”—once again, examined—“debated, sometimes amended and ultimately either rejected or proclaimed....”", "How can we examine this bill if the texts as to the government’s principles are omitted from the bill? How can that happen?", "It goes on: “In the Parliament of Canada, there is a clearly defined method for enacting legislation. This method is based on the examination of bills—formal legislative proposals that have been referred to by one authority.” The examination of bills: It is the great function of Parliament.", "Madam Speaker, I’ll go on a little bit more on this process, but just so we can be sure that I’m speaking with accuracy, I’d like to refer the members to Hansard yesterday morning, when the Attorney General spoke to this bill.", "He goes on: “With this in mind, our government is prepared to take yet another extraordinary step. We plan to be the first jurisdiction in Canada to bar political candidates and MPPs outright from attending political fundraising events.” Is that in the bill? No, it’s not. It’s not in the bill.", "“As I have already said, even the perception of a conflict of interest or of undue influence over a politician can weaken our democracy,” he goes on to say. So he’s going to take this extraordinary step. I continue to quote from Hansard, from the Attorney General: “While the reforms already in this bill would go a long way towards preserving the confidence of Ontario voters, over the summer our government came to realize that it just wasn’t enough.” There wasn’t enough in the bill. Now, they had the opportunity, at prorogation, to bring in these further amendments. They chose not to.", "The Attorney General continues: “This is a dramatic and progressive change and we do want to be clear about its impact.... We plan to introduce this measure in an amendment at the committee stage.”", "We have the Attorney General’s own words that this bill is incomplete in his view—in the government’s view; in the executive’s view. This bill is incomplete, and they will introduce a completely new principle to the bill, of banning all candidates from attending fundraisers—well beyond the scope of the present bill, by any objective measure.", "He goes on, because it’s not just banning fundraising and expanding the principle of this bill at second reading that the Attorney General plans on doing: “I would like to remind the colleagues of another set of proposed changes that are being planned” for Bill 2, “apart from the finance reform”—changes that he has already mentioned—“but in a very different way: by seeking to boost voter engagement and participation.” That’s not in the bill. There are no clauses about boosting voter participation and engagement.", "He goes on: “Many of the changes we will be proposing address recommendations that were made by our Chief Electoral Officer as part of the review he does after every election.”", "Once again, let’s go back to parliamentary convention, standing orders, the rules of debate. We must be able to examine before we can intelligently vote on a bill. This government, it appears, is purposely preventing us from examining the intentions because we can’t debate this. We can’t debate a phantom.", "I believe it is in the best interest of this government to reconsider what they’re planning on doing if they’re saying something different in Hansard from what they’re doing with Bill 2 in the text. I’m going to send a notice of intention to the Speaker, not only on how this is unconventional with the standing orders but how it may also be a breach of our privilege, precluding us from discussing the principles and merits.", "Another proposal that the Attorney General has said is that he plans to move the fixed election date from fall to spring. There is no mention of changing the election dates in Bill 2. How are we to actually debate what this government plans on doing?", "Speaker, I’m going to just read one more element here. This is on page 728 of O’Brien and Bosc: “Since Confederation, the Chair has held that the introduction of bills that contain blank passages or that are in an imperfect shape is clearly contrary to the standing orders.... Although this provision exists mainly in contemplation of errors identified when a bill is introduced, members have brought such defects or anomalies to the attention of the Chair at various stages in the legislative process. In the past, the Speaker has directed that the order for second reading of certain bills be discharged, when it was discovered that they were not in their final form and were therefore not ready to be introduced.” That’s on page 728 of O’Brien and Bosc.", "I say to this House, is this bill in its final form when the very mover of the bill, the Attorney General, says it isn’t and when he says he’s going to change it transformatively?", "I know that this will take some moments for the Speaker to consider and for the table to consider, but I would suggest that this bill is out of order based on the statements by the Attorney General. Something is not consistent here. There is a contradiction between a bill that is in its final form and the very mover of the bill who says that it is not in its final form.", "Speaker, I would ask you to consider my request that this bill is out of order. I know that you’ll probably want to take some time to reserve judgment, and I’ll be happy to continue on my debate." ],

I want to assure the Chair that this came to light during the leadoff debate yesterday morning when I thought I heard the Attorney General say certain things, but I had to wait to get the Hansard and verify that what I thought I heard was actually what I did hear.", "But just to go on: On that process once again, Speaker, I want to make sure that everybody in the House is informed and knowledgeable that during first reading committee hearings on this bill, we had a number of exceptional professional individuals and people from all walks of life come to the committee hearings, make their deputations known, make their concerns on how the bill may affect them known. One of them was the Auditor General. Bonnie Lysyk was there and gave her deputation. She gave her comments.", "Of course, what the Auditor General suggested that the Legislature should consider for Bill 201 at the time, now Bill 2, didn’t make it into the amendment process. I’ll just a quote from Bonnie Lysyk’s commentary: “Ontario’s Liberal government would enjoy a ‘political advantage’ over rivals under Premier Kathleen Wynne’s proposed campaign financing reforms, warns Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk.”", "An independent officer of the House made her presentations known. She also, of course, strongly recommended that government advertising fall back under her purview, her jurisdiction, under Bill 201, but the Liberal members of the committee unfortunately voted down the opposition amendments to include that jurisdiction for our Auditor General.", "There’s also another independent officer of the Legislature, David Wake, our Integrity Commissioner, who spoke at first reading committee hearings.", "It was interesting; the Integrity Commissioner expanded on a number of topics. One of them was one I didn’t realize. As we were talking about cash-for-access and how the ministerial staff were being used to sell fundraising tickets to stakeholders and to people the government and those ministers do business with—oftentimes we heard that was a practice that was delegated off to their staff. Of course, the staff don’t fall under the Members’ Integrity Act, but they are captured in one little way. It was really mind-boggling when the Integrity Commissioner told us that if or when the Integrity Commissioner investigates the actions or activities of ministerial staff, the only consequence, the only remedy, is to inform the minister of the wrongdoing of their staff.", "I’m going to paint a picture. It’s very clear. The minister tells his staff to go out and engage in cash-for-access activities, go out and sell tickets to his stakeholders. Somebody complains to the Integrity Commissioner. The Integrity Commissioner examines that. If he finds wrongdoing, he reports it back to the minister who directed the wrongdoing. There’s no other remedy. There’s no other consequence. It’s astonishing. This is how this Liberal government has weaved and crafted the rules to shield themselves from the law.", "We brought in amendments, and the Integrity Commissioner spoke to this. He said that we need to make changes to the integrity act. He also spoke of that famous meeting between our finance minister and then-Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli when they met with the host of banks that were involved in the selling of shares in Hydro One and where each of these banks paid $10,000 to have an exclusive meeting with the two ministers involved. And David Wake said, “The law prevents me. The Members’ Integrity Act prevents me from finding fault.”", "He says that perceived faults, perceived conflicts, potential conflicts are outside of his investigative powers. He can only investigate if he knows that there is real conflict. Of course, how can you find out if there’s real conflict when nobody is allowed to lodge a complaint against that minister except for another MPP? It’s amazing.", "Those people who, some might say, are being shaken down for money on cash-for-access can’t bring a complaint to the Integrity Commissioner. She or he has no mechanism to receive a complaint from the public or even to launch an investigation on his or her own accord. So even with this information that was widely circulated within the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star about this shakedown activity, the Integrity Commissioner says, “I can’t do anything about it.” The law shields and protects the minister from those investigations.", "The Integrity Commissioner spoke, and amendments on that were struck down. The Auditor General spoke, and amendments on that were struck down, disregarded. But here we see this new one. To sort of deflect and take people’s eyes off that scandalous cash-for-access behaviour, that cabinet without a moral compass—the Attorney General comes out and says, “We’re going to prevent all MPPs, all candidates, from attending fundraisers.”", "Now, Speaker, I’m going to say, there was only one deputant to the committee who suggested that that was a reasonable alternative, that that was a reasonable recommendation for the committee to consider. I think it’s important that this House understand who said that. It was the Communist Party of Canada that suggested that no fundraising be permitted and no attendance.", "So, the independent officers of Parliament, their recommendations: Throw them away. The Integrity Commissioner’s recommendations: Throw them away. But the Attorney General of this great province takes a recommendation from the Communist Party of Canada on our election financing reforms? Astonishing. Doesn’t anybody find that astonishing? I do. I know the people of Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington would be astonished to learn that the Attorney General believes the commentary and the examination and the recommendations of the Communist—" ],

I did mention a little bit. Again, just so the Minister of Agriculture doesn’t get confused, cash-for-access was the motivation. The Premier said herself that she needed to bring in this bill because of the—she said “perceived”—conflicts of interest. Others may have used different words other than “perception,” but that was the motivation.", "Let me just start here with a story from the Globe and Mail, July 25. The headline is: “Ontario Ministerial Aides Tapped to Sell Tickets to Fundraisers.”", "“In some cases, staffers would tell stakeholders that a minister they wanted to meet with did not have the time to see them during regular business hours.” I don’t know what regular business hours are for ministers. I know my idea of regular business hours as an MPP is there are no regular business hours; it’s all the time, every time. “But they could instead”—quoting from the story—“buy a ticket to a fundraiser and meet the minister there. The consequences to companies of not going was that their phone calls would not be returned and they would be treated more brusquely, some sources said.", "“The practice of staffers raising money for the party is legal,” as I mentioned earlier, and even if it wasn’t legal, the remedy is to tell the person who told them to do it that they did it and hope that the minister would slap them on the wrist, I guess, or something to that effect, “and there is no indication that any of them used government resources for fundraising. Typically, they would use personal emails or mobile phones to contact potential donors.”", "And we heard about this from John Gerretsen, the former Attorney General, when he was at the committee in Kingston, and it was a breath of fresh air. It’s always a breath of fresh air when you speak to a politician who is no longer in politics. But John Gerretsen—and I shouldn’t say that, because I found John always, always, to be a very upstanding Attorney General, as well as Minister of Municipal Affairs, among others, and quite a committed individual in serving the public. But he said, when talking about these quotas that Liberal ministers had to raise money, that he just left it up to the staff. Did those people get better access to him? He said, “Well, I don’t really know. You’d have to talk to my staff.” Did people get things that others didn’t? He says, “Well, you’d have to talk to staff, because they are the ones who sold the tickets. They’re the ones who booked the meetings.” But John Gerretsen said it’s time to get the big money out of politics. I agree. I agree with John Gerretsen more than I agree with the Communist Party of Canada. I agree with the Integrity Commissioner more than I agree with the Communist Party of Canada.", "Speaker, here’s another one, again from the same article of July 25:", "“One invitation, to a $2,500-a-ticket cocktail reception”—I guess after hours—“on Nov. 30 last year for Michael Coteau, then the Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport, told donors to contact his director of stakeholder relations, Sara Alimardani,” to RSVP for these events. So no connection, except his employee. No connection.", "There’s a host of these. I know they were concerning to the Premier, because we know that after seeing all these stories, she immediately one weekend got some napkins out and wrote up the Bill 201 legislation on some napkins at her kitchen table. Now we know the Attorney General wants to throw out that napkin and start afresh with a whole bunch of other stuff.", "That reminds me: I should bring this up to the House as well. I had a technical briefing on this bill the other day, and of course, this is a bill by the Attorney General. That’s who has moved it; that’s who is the author of it, so we’re told. So my staff and I met with the technical briefing team on Bill 2, the Attorney General’s bill. Guess what? Maybe you’ll find this astonishing, maybe not. There was no representation from the Ministry of the Attorney General there. They were not providing the technical briefing. I said, “Who are you? You’re not from the Attorney General. Who is providing this briefing?” It was a staffer from the Ministry of Intergovernmental Affairs. Of course, who’s the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs? The Premier.", "I guess she didn’t like the first napkin and has come back with a new one as well and instructed the Attorney General to make these outrageous statements yesterday in the House—of circumventing due process, preventing and precluding members from examining the intentions of this government.", "Fundraising is—and I could go on. Maybe I’ll do a few more things on these fundraisers. Again from the Globe and Mail story: “On the evening of March 2, 2015, Premier Kathleen Wynne gathered with eight guests who paid $10,000 each for exclusive face time. Three months earlier, 22 donors spent $5,000 apiece to be entertained by Finance Minister Charles Sousa.” Entertained by Charles Sousa: I know he’s a great entertainer but I personally wouldn’t pay $5,000 to be entertained by the finance minister. Maybe they had something else they were looking for other than just entertainment.", "That was also to attend a reception with Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli. It goes on—these were three of the more than 150 intimate cash-for-access fundraisers by the Ontario Liberal Party.", "“The analysis reveals that attendees included construction firms with lucrative government infrastructure contracts, electricity companies with an interest in seeing the government continue outsourcing ... the province’s power generation, pharmaceutical corporations that depend on the province to list their drugs for coverage and,” of course, “the banks that made nearly $60 million off the privatization of Hydro One.”", "Fine entertainment; $5,000, $10,000 for some entertainment. These are pretty astonishing. Many of us in this House, when these revelations first came forward, thought there was justification for a public inquiry to the extent of what was going on. I still hold true and firm that belief, that we don’t really know what sort of entertainment was provided and that a public inquiry ought to be under way. I think those people who had to pay $10,000 for face time with a member of cabinet ought to feel free to speak out and say what they felt, what they heard, what they saw, otherwise we just won’t know what happened behind those closed doors. But we know a public inquiry was not what the Premier was looking for. She was looking for some way to deflect this scandal.", "Here’s a comment in here—and of course, I should emphasize this as well because we heard this throughout these revelations and we heard it again just the other day when I asked a question of the Premier about this recent high-powered, big-money fundraiser where no ministers attended, but her chief of staff attended. What was his name? The other one? Teliszewsky, the senior policy adviser for the Minister of Energy—they were there. A bunch of high-powered ministerial staff and chiefs of staff were there but no ministers.", "What was clear in talking to those individuals who spent that big money: They were fearful to come forward and say when it happened, who was there. They were fearful that their contracts and their standing and their relationship with the government and doing business with the government would be threatened and jeopardized if they came out of the woodpile; that if they came out and spoke, their businesses would be harmed; that their revenues would be diminished. That’s a terrible, profound commentary on our society: when businesses who do business with the government are fearful of the relationship.", "I grew up—and I still have a firm belief that I will never fear government. Nobody should ever fear our government and what they will do. The only government I know of that one ought to be fearful of is a despot, a tyrant, a Communist. Those governments you should be fearful of. But a duly, properly elected representative democracy—people fear their government? What have we come to, Speaker? What have we come to, when people need to spend money to access their elected representatives and then are fearful to speak out in public for fear of consequences. I don’t know how we’ve allowed our democracy to come to this state. I just don’t know how it happened, but I know that all members of this House have an obligation to turn it around. We all have an obligation to turn this ship around and say to the people of Ontario, “We have a moral compass. We know the difference between vice and virtue. We will go with virtue, not vice. We know the difference between right and wrong, and we will legislate for right, not for wrong.” We must all do that. But we’re not going to get it with Bill 2 and these transformative changes that the Attorney General has stated he’s going to bring in at clause-by-clause consideration.", "I want to finish off, Speaker, with the consequences. I spoke about the motivations, the abuse, the cash for access. It’s also important to speak of the consequences, whether intended or unintended. Again, we would be better off, we would most appropriately be able to evaluate the consequences if we could examine the text, but of course we can’t. But from what the minister has said, what the Attorney General has said, both in this House and by way of press release, it is important for us to begin to consider, so let us think.", "Elected members will be prevented from going to fundraising, whether they’re $5, whether they’re $50, whether they’re with—every year I have a barbecue in my backyard. I’ve got an old place outside of town. I’ve got some acreage. I rent a tent and set up some barbecues, and a couple of hundred people come to my house, to my backyard and we cook up hamburgers. Will I be allowed to be in my backyard? I don’t know. Listen, let me just be very clear. When I have the barbecue in my backyard, there is no demand that you must pay money. I’m opening up my home, my family’s home, to be engaged with my constituents. If they want to leave some money behind for my campaign, they’re more than welcome; I won’t turn it away. But there is no cost to come. So am I not going to be allowed to have my constituents come to my backyard under this?", "Just think of this: all MPPs. Now we also have heard, by way of press release, that this will also extend to candidates. Let’s look at the candidates, somebody who, like me 10 years ago, wanted to get into politics. I was an electrician. I didn’t have a lot of money. I didn’t have a network of Bay Street financiers in downtown Lanark county. The next Randy Hillier in Lanark county is not going to be able to raise funds.", "How is that person going to raise funds if they are not allowed to go to a fundraiser? How are MPPs going to raise funds? Because we know the public subsidy that is included in Bill 2 only goes to the central party; $2.71 per vote in the last election goes to the central party. What comes to the local campaign in the bill? Zero. Nothing comes to the MPPs. Nothing comes to the local riding associations. But $2.71 will go to the party.", "I don’t know about you, Speaker—I think I do. I think everybody in in this House runs their own campaign. We buy our own signs. We print our own literature. We rent our own campaign offices. Some of us may buy radio advertising or print advertising. I don’t know about everybody else, but the party doesn’t pay for my campaign. Maybe they pay for Jeff’s." ],

Will it prevent new blood, new parties, new candidates from entering into the public square of political debate?", "Once again, the money, the public subsidy, the $2.71 a vote, is going to the central party.

The official opposition will be next in line, then the third party. But what happens to the Green Party and the Family Coalition Party or the—I think we have 19 different parties in this province.

I don’t think voters knew that. We didn’t know that. I don’t think most of us knew that.", "Again, he’s talking about specific people with specific aims.

Hence his ability,” says Martin, “to raise a remarkable $100,000 in a single evening (with [Premier] Wynne at his side) when Bruce Power brought together a dozen supporters for”—and these are his words—“a cozy Yorkville dinner, as first reported ... in 2013.” That’s significant because Bruce Power and others stand to gain substantial rewards from this very minister.", "None other than John Gerretsen—and quite frankly, shout-outs to John Gerretsen, who apparently appeared before the committee and supported some of the New Democratic Party amendments.

He says, “I hated the whole aspect of fundraising.” No kidding. “If a major issue comes up, and you have been funded by lobbyists on behalf of any kind of industry, you’re going to be affected by that ... it’s human nature.” No kidding it’s human nature. If you’re responsible for raising $500,000 in your term as cabinet minister, and somebody’s willing to give you $100,000, they’re going to get your ear, or else you might not get your position.

We had an instance where GreenField, the biggest corporate donor to the Ontario Liberals since Kathleen Wynne became Premier in 2013, donated more than—and listen to this—$480,000 to the Ontario Liberal Party. But it turns out to be a good investment. Hey, I have nothing against business—I was in business at one point in my life—but look at this. Look at the return on this investment: $480,000 that they invested in the Ontario Liberal Party, and they received back $160 million in government support. I’d say that’s a good return on investment; $480,000 sounds like a lot of money, but if you get $160 million back, that’s not a bad investment at all. Actually, that was the single biggest one, but it’s significant over the years. So if $480,000 gets you $160 million, I would pay.

It was to bring down, of course, the amount of donations individuals can give. It was to ban union and corporate donations—good thing. We have always supported that in the New Democratic Party. It has always been a part of our policy to ban union and corporate donations. Mind you, I would want to make a difference between a union—just an association of workers—and a corporation, which is a profit-driven enterprise. There is a difference there. But we’ve always had it as part of our policy—no problem there.", "But we all know that individual donations can still come from folk in unions and folk in corporations.

Not so much. Because one thing that hasn’t been mentioned, or at least I haven’t heard it in this debate so far, is advertising, for example. There will be limits on advertising—I think it’s a million dollars for parties. However, the government gets to spend $40 million in advertising on behalf of the Ontario government, which of course our wonderful Auditor General, Bonnie Lysyk, pointed out as being problematic. Yes, it’s problematic. Third-party advertising: Yes, there were some problems there and we needed to do something about it. But this is going to effectively shut the mouths of, for example, parents who want to fight for more effective help for their children with autism. It’s going to shut their mouths. But the government can still keep talking about how wonderful it is, using taxpayers’ dollars that will not be covered by this legislation and will not even be covered by her, so she will not be able to rule on it. That’s also part of Bill 2.", "So really, what do we have here? Again, we have—and it has been alluded to—a public relations exercise, because all of the amendments, which we haven’t seen, which we haven’t been able to read and hence cannot really debate—what we have here in black and white in Bill 2 is clearly inadequate, clearly not up for what I think our friends, again, in the fourth estate—who are doing their job, holding all of our feet to the fire. They’re asking for transparency. They’re asking for openness. They’re asking for an end to cash for access, an end to undue influence by some parties on those who have the money to award undue access, which would not be allowed in many organizations, undue access to those holding the purse strings. That’s not going to change with this. That’s the sadness of it. That’s the shadow here. That’s a shadow between what we all hoped for and I think what we all want to achieve—I really do—and what we’ll actually get.", "What we’ll actually get, again, says our wonderful Auditor General and others, is even more of an edge given to the Liberal Party, which I don’t think was Martin Regg Cohn’s idea in writing that article that clearly pushed the government along this path. I don’t think it was Mike Crawley’s idea, writing for the CBC. I really don’t think it was their hope, in this piece of legislation, that what we would get is more of the same under a new guise, in a new costume. That’s essentially what we will get.", "If the government is allowed to spend $40 million, which they did, on advertising about how wonderful they are, which we’re already hearing, and the opposition is not allowed to spend more than X amount, depending on what the amendments bring in, that’s not fair. If ministers are still allowed, through their proxies, through their chiefs of staff, through others, to get folk to give them money in the hopes of getting something in return—cash-for-access, the original problem—that’s not fair either. If we are all hampered from holding a spaghetti dinner for $50 a head in our backyards because of what they’ve done, that’s not fair either. I think our voters, I think those who sent us here, who elected us here, who get, as I said at the beginning, apoplectic about the idea that there are special interests that have more of the government’s ear than they do, even though there are more of them, way more of them than those who can afford the $18,000 tables, way more of them—even if the individual contribution rate comes down, we’ll see a whole lot of individuals, I imagine, many of them, one might suspect, GreenField employees, for example. Do we really believe that that’s going to change?", "I think my voters don’t really believe it’s going to change. My voters and the people I speak to and the people we speak to, I don’t think they really think that this Bill 2, even with the proposed amendments—people like John Gerretsen, the whistle-blower Attorney General and Minister of Housing, among many other portfolios that he had, who came forward and actually supported some of the New Democratic Party’s amendments: I don’t think he thinks that this bill, even with its amendments, will get the job done. That’s sad because we do need that job to get done. We do.", "Martin Regg Cohn, when he wrote that article, saw a problem and highlighted it, as is his job. Mike Crawley saw a problem and highlighted it; that’s his job. The fourth estate has done its job and now the voters are looking to us, and what they’re seeing in Bill 2 is not what needs to get done, even with the amendments.", "I’ve got 29 seconds in which to convey my voters to this government and to say that since this is a not-done deal, clearly, since there are lots of amendments coming forward, please, please, take this opportunity to get the job done right, to actually change cash-for-access, to actually change the way political advertising and fundraising is done and, finally, not just in the PR sense, not just in the spirit of the law but the letter of the law, make it fair." ],

There are a lot of rules in government, of course, once you get into government, but when you’re a nomination candidate to run to be the MPP for your party, you have to have that mini-campaign in the context of a contested nomination.

We don’t have access to the large fundraisers that have been alleged to have taken place in the past and which have certainly helped finance all three parties, but certainly one party to more of an advantage than the others.", "So while we agree that there needed to be something done, we’re not sure what the government is proposing in this respect. I think one of my colleagues said that perhaps a better way to have handled this would have been to have taken three retired members from all three parties—the Conservatives, the Liberals and the NDP—have those three former members who had been through the process come forward with some recommendations that the committee, at that time, could have taken a look at. It probably would have made a lot more sense than something that has been drafted, it looks like, in the backrooms and that, I think, at the end of the day, won’t be satisfactory." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you for the opportunity to be able to make a few comments on my colleague from Parkdale–High Park on Bill 2.", "One of the things that struck me the most is that the origin of this issue was media reports about fundraising quotas that ministers had to attain. Now, I’m a dairy farmer; I understand quotas. You have to work hard to fill your quota. You buy feed from the right places and do all of these things to fill your quota. As soon as I hear that someone has to fill a quota, the perception that I feel is that filling that quota might not necessarily be in the public interest. Because the quota isn’t for the public; the quota you’re filling is for the party. You are fulfilling a job that should be in the public interest, but you are being forced to choose between your interests. That’s what those articles brought forward.", "I think that is a big reason for this bill, but the same issues aren’t really addressed by this bill, because the quota could still be there. It could be filled, as the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington said, by a proxy. The quota is still there, and that’s a big problem with this bill.", "This bill is painting everything with a big wide brush to cover up the blemishes that are in some parts of the system. It would be much better if it actually looked at making the system fairer for the people of Ontario." ],

There were ministers from all of the provinces and territories in Canada, and they were all so complimentary of Ontario as to how far we were going and how bold we were with some of the fundraising changes that we’re proposing. So I’m just a little surprised that the member would say that it’s inadequate.", "The second thing I found was that the basic premise of her argument against the bill is that people will break the rules. “These rules that you are proposing are no good because people will find a way to break the rules.” But that would be the case with any legislation that we propose, because you could say, “All these rules are great, but what about all the people who are going to break the rules or find ways around them?” The basic premise that I heard over and over again was, “This doesn’t work because somehow donors and MPPs are going to find a way around it and people are still going to do cash-for-access.”", "That basic premise is wrong. You can’t criticize legislation on the assumption that somehow people are going to break the rules. We make the rules and we expect Ontarians to follow the rules. As legislators, first and foremost, we have to uphold the rules. I think we should go forward on this bill and argue this on the basis that people will follow the rules and not assume from the get-go that people are going to get around the rules that we are proposing.", "If we assume that people are going to follow the rules, because that’s what good Ontarians do, I believe this is a good bill." ],

The rules that you have in Bill 2 still allow cash-for-access and still allow the government to spend way more than opposition parties on advertising. This is from the Auditor General; I didn’t make this stuff up.", "Really, one should read her analysis—not only hers, but David Wake’s, who is the Ontario Integrity Commissioner, who said that banning cash-for-access was the reason for this bill, but it’s not in the bill. My appeal to the government is put it in there. Make the rules the rules. It’s not about breaking them; make the rules the rules.", "Listen, the Minister of Health has joined us. I’m a fan of the Minister of Health. I don’t know the Minister of Finance as well, but he seems like a nice man. We in the New Democratic Party just want to make their lives, and all the cabinet members’ lives, easier. To have to raise $500,000—that’s onerous. That should not be part of what it takes to sit at the cabinet table. We think cabinet members should be chosen because of their abilities and their strengths, not because they’re good telemarketers or good fundraisers. That should not be what gets you to the cabinet table.", "We in the New Democratic Party are working hard for the members of the Liberal cabinet to really relieve them of this undue stress. To have to raise $250,000 to $500,000 isn’t fair. We’re doing our civic duty over here. I would simply say that most of our voters would say it’s not fair, either.", "Again, they shouldn’t have to do that. The Liberal Party shouldn’t make them do that. We should have a system that’s fair, where the rules are clear and, yes, where we follow the rules." ],

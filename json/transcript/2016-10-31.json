In 1917, Ontario women secured the right to vote in provincial elections. In 1943, the first women MPPs were elected to the Ontario Legislature. And in 1972, Margaret Birch, the gracious and remarkable woman we are honouring today, took her seat around the cabinet table, becoming the first woman in Ontario to participate directly in government decision-making as a member of the executive council.", "For all of us in this House, but especially for women, Margaret Birch is one of those on whose shoulders we stand: an inspiring trailblazer, a dedicated advocate and a tireless public servant whose name will forever be inscribed in the history books of our province.", "Margaret’s story began in southwestern Ontario. Born and raised in Leamington, Margaret was forced to quit school at the age of 12 to help care for her younger siblings after her father grew ill. By the age of 16, she was working for $3 a day as a tobacco picker. She later moved on to the job of quality control at the Heinz plant, where she oversaw the labelling of ketchup bottles.", "Her future legacy as a barrier-breaker and change-maker in Ontario politics was presaged by the early grit, tenacity and determination she displayed throughout those challenging early years.", "In many ways, Margaret’s path to elected office is typical of many women’s entry into public life. She became involved in her community, she saw a problem and she wanted to fix it.", "After moving to Scarborough with her husband, newspaper editor Guy Birch, and their two children, Margaret began volunteering at the local hospital where she experienced first-hand the impact on patients and families when health care needs were not being met.", "In 1962, she took her first run for office at the municipal level with a platform focused on bringing more hospital beds to Scarborough. Although she did not win that election, she succeeded in getting approval for a new hospital and was invited to sit on the hospital’s board of governors. Of all of her achievements, it is her role as a founding member of Scarborough Centenary Hospital, now part of the Rouge Valley Health System, that she is most proud. When the hospital expanded in 1986, the Margaret Birch Wing was officially opened to honour this important contribution.", "With her intelligence, commitment and passion for health care, she was a natural choice to chair the Scarborough Board of Health in 1963. Four years later, she joined the mental health council, travelling across the province to review mental health services.", "Shortly after being named Scarborough’s citizen of the year in 1970, she was approached about running in the 1971 Ontario election, and she put her name on the ballot as the Progressive Conservative candidate in Scarborough East.", "It’s difficult to imagine what it must have been like for Margaret as one of only two women out of the 121 MPPs who were elected that year. But with her usual energy and aplomb, she set to work as a backbench MPP.", "One year later, on September 28, 1972, she was appointed Minister without Portfolio by Premier Bill Davis. Although this barrier had been broken at the federal level some 15 years earlier, Bill Davis deserves much credit for a decision that was not without controversy. Not only did he appoint Margaret to cabinet, he quickly promoted her to the position of Provincial Secretary for Social Development. For the next nine years, she served as a super minister, responsible for the coordination of services across six different ministries involving health care, social services and education.", "The door to the cabinet room wasn’t the only door that Margaret opened during her time at Queen’s Park. Told that she could not attend a political speech at the downtown Toronto Albany Club because female members were not permitted, Margaret complained to the Premier: “If I’m good enough to sit in this cabinet with all these men,” she said, “surely I’m good enough to be a member of the Albany Club.” Premier Davis agreed, and Margaret Birch became the first female member of that once-male bastion.", "During her 14 years in government, Margaret advanced policy to improve the lives of women, youth and seniors. Her passion and some of her most effective advocacy, however, was for veterans and people living with mental illness. She frequently toured facilities and came up with programming alternatives that reduced isolation.", "Not only was she a pioneer in her achievements in the Legislature, she was also a pioneer in the field of mental health. She fought tirelessly for less institutionalized models of care.", "Margaret’s efforts and success demonstrated to Ontarians that the opinions and contributions of women matter, and that better decisions are made when women are involved in making them. She opened the door to opportunity for all of the women sitting in this Legislature now and in the future.", "Margaret, on behalf of the Ontario NDP caucus, I am honoured to pay tribute to you today. We thank you for your leadership in paving the way for women’s participation in the political decision-making processes that affect them, their communities and their families, and for inspiring us to continue breaking barriers until women’s full equality is achieved." ],

She’s here to receive the Distinguished Service Award from the Ontario Association of Former Parliamentarians. I could not agree more with their choice, and I know that that is the sentiment in the Legislature.", "Margaret’s story, some of which you have heard, is a testament to the power and importance of having women actively engaged in politics.", "Les réalisations de Margaret à titre de députée et de ministre nous montrent ce que nous pouvons accomplir lorsqu’un plus grand nombre de femmes entrent dans la vie publique.", "Margaret was first elected as the MPP for Scarborough East in 1971. That’s an election I remember well. The voting age in Ontario was lowered from 21 to 18 that year. I turned 18 that year, so I couldn’t wait to get out to vote for the very first time.", "I also remember that Margaret was one of only two women in her party’s caucus. But Margaret was not intimidated. This is a woman who had faced uphill battles from an early age. At 12, as we have heard, she left school in Leamington to take care of her five younger siblings so that their mother could work while their father battled cancer. At 16, she helped to support her family by working in the tobacco fields of southwestern Ontario, earning $3 a day for literally back-breaking work.", "It will come as no surprise to hear that as an adult Margaret was not just helping to improve the lives of her family members; she was helping to improve the lives of people across her community. While Margaret and her husband, Guy Birch, raised their son and daughter in Scarborough, she began volunteering at the local hospital. She worked her way up to become the chair of the Scarborough board of health. In 1970, she was recognized as Scarborough’s Citizen of the Year. A cabinet minister from the PC party took that opportunity to phone and encourage her to run provincially, and she literally answered the call.", "Once elected, Margaret took that passion for young people and health care and turned it into concrete changes in the province—positive changes in people’s lives. In her first year on the job, she helped to create a summer jobs program for youth, long before there was a children and youth services ministry. In 1972, she was named Minister without Portfolio, becoming the first female cabinet minister in Ontario’s history. She seized that opportunity to bring her lifelong interest in children and health issues directly to the cabinet table.", "Margaret toured health care facilities. She met with patients. She learned more about problems, like the problems of overcrowding that were in those facilities at the time. She visited mental health institutions at a time when they were still deeply, deeply stigmatized. She was instrumental in the creation of the Assistive Devices Program, which is still in place to this day, which helps children with mobility issues get the walkers, braces and wheelchairs that they require. It began with children, but I believe that at the time Margaret and Dennis Timbrell said, “It will start with children, but soon everyone will have those services.”", "As has already been said, she broke barriers in the Legislature but in society as well. I’m going to tell the same story that was told by my colleague, but I just want to read from Steve Paikin’s great new book on William Grenville Davis. I’ll just read the story about the Albany Club because I think it’s one where we can all get a sense of the grit and the feistiness of Margaret Birch:", "“But breaking the gender barrier in cabinet wasn’t Birch’s only claim to fame. At this point in its history the downtown Toronto haunt for Conservatives for nearly a century, the Albany Club, still only permitted male members. The federal PC leader, Robert Stanfield, was about to make a guest appearance at the club, and Birch wanted to go. But, of course, that wasn’t permitted. Birch approached the Premier to discuss the issue.", "“‘If I’m good enough to sit in this cabinet with all these men, surely I’m good enough to be a member of the Albany Club,’ she told the Premier.", "“‘You’re right,’ Davis answered. ‘We’ll work on that.’", "“And that’s how Margaret Birch also became one of the first three female members of the Albany Club. Her proposer was none other than the 18th Premier of Ontario.” Kudos to Margaret Birch, and to Bill Davis, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker.", "I deeply believe that we need to have more women actively engaged in politics, and Margaret proves exactly why it’s so important. Women need a seat at the table because they make a difference at the table, and that difference makes a difference in society.", "I want to express my deepest thanks to Margaret Birch today for answering the call in 1970 and paving the way for more women—including me and all of the women in this Legislature—to enter public life. We would not be where we are without you.", "Women now make up 40% of Ontario’s cabinet. We’re having open and productive conversations about issues like the gender wage gap and combating sexual violence. Child care and education are, and have been, in the spotlight for years, and this is because of women like Margaret. Ontario is lucky to have such a remarkable woman in our history books, and we’re all humbled to have you here with us today. Thank you so much." ],

She is a person I have come to admire a great deal. Every one of the people I talked to described Margaret as having an exceptional character and as one of the nicest people you would ever meet.", "She was also known for her elegance. In fact, during her first provincial election campaign 45 years ago, she famously handed out the first ever oval-shaped campaign button in order to accommodate her trademark hairstyle in the picture. Her sense of style also extended to her campaign office, which was appropriately decorated with birch trees.", "On October 21, 1971, Margaret Birch was elected as the Progressive Conservative representative for the riding of Scarborough East. She arrived at Queen’s Park determined to make a difference, and her slogan in that campaign had been, “Margaret Birch cares.” It would come to perfectly sum up her long and successful career both inside and outside of politics.", "In 1972, Premier Bill Davis would make history by appointing Margaret to cabinet, making her Ontario’s first ever female cabinet minister. As a newly elected Premier, appointing women to cabinet was something that he was determined to do. In Margaret Birch, Premier Davis found a serious candidate.", "Many of those who knew her well described her as being a level-headed professional, using terms like “on an even keel” and “serene.” Premier Davis further described her as someone who displayed a strong sense of loyalty, great integrity and genuine interest in other people. These characteristics make her a role model for all Ontarians to follow today and into the future.", "Although initially appointed Minister without Portfolio responsible for youth, she was very soon given significantly expanded responsibilities as Provincial Secretary for Social Development, which was a super ministry—one of only three—responsible for a broad array of social policy areas.", "Margaret took public service seriously and was not afraid to face challenges or to take stands on difficult issues. She worked hard to deliver meaningful results to the people of Ontario, and her success and effectiveness as a minister made her indispensable to the government, so much so that even as she planned her departure from politics in 1981, she was asked by Premier Davis to stay a while longer in order to help organize Ontario’s bicentennial. As with all things she undertook, she delivered. The bicentennial was described as a well-articulated retrospective celebration, and it was a fitting note on which to end her amazing political career.", "Of course, the Margaret Birch story doesn’t end here. When Margaret left Queen’s Park in 1985, she continued to pursue her passion for service. As a dedicated resident of Scarborough, she was also proud to be honoured by the Centenary hospital in 1986, which named a wing of the hospital after her. This was in recognition of both her achievements at Queen’s Park and for her contributions as chair of the Scarborough Board of Health, where she had served for eight years prior to her election in 1971. Specifically, she had been instrumental in choosing the site of the hospital, now a key part of the Rouge Valley Health System.", "If I could add a chapter to the Albany Club story: One of my first events as an MPP in Toronto was with Margaret Birch at the Albany Club.", "She still likes to drive and recently passed her driving test with flying colours. Not so long ago, Margaret’s son had to call her friend’s house at 11 o’clock at night to see if his mother was still there, and she was.", "One more anecdote comes from Bill Davis’s book launch, which she attended. She arrived at the event stylish as ever, back straight, in high heels, and expressed her surprise at how old her former caucus colleagues seemed to be. Mr. Davis, on that night, pointed out that even though Margaret is now 95 years old, she looks and acts more like 55. So I guess 95 is the new 55.", "Speaker, next year we mark the 100th anniversary of women in Ontario having gained the right to vote. In Margaret Birch, we have a living example of what women have been able to achieve in Ontario, so it is appropriate that the Ontario Association of Former Parliamentarians has chosen to honour her this year. We can be very proud of her legacy as the first female Ontario cabinet minister. We also admire her grace and poise in her post-political life.", "Let me close by thanking Margaret Birch for her important contributions to our province and her family for encouraging her and sharing her with us.", "Margaret, we are grateful for your work and wish you continued health in the near future." ],

All the hard work and dedication by the organizers and hundreds of volunteers, the generosity of sponsors and the enthusiasm of the entire community is the reason why the Scarecrow Invasion and Family Festival has earned this recognition over the past 20 years.", "In 2002, the scarecrow invasion tried to challenge the record for most scarecrows in the Guinness Book of World Records. Meaford created 2,211 scarecrows, but the record was not achieved. Now in its 20th year, the invasion has 300 volunteers dedicating over 3,000 hours.", "I would also like to pay special tribute to a Meaford businessman who was honoured for his role in starting the scarecrow invasion 20 years ago. George Potopnyk was one of the 60 to 70 guests attending the 20th anniversary of the Scarecrow Invasion and Family Festival in the gallery of Meaford Hall. I invite the House to join me in congratulating Marilyn Morris, George Potopnyk and the entire Meaford community for ensuring the Meaford Scarecrow Invasion and Family Festival achieved top honours, and wish them much continued success." ],

The program is called Positive Voice, and it has been organized by the staff at the Nokee Kwe employment and education centre in London–Fanshawe.", "The main philosophy of the program aims to provide a safe space for the mentorship and empowerment of urban aboriginal women. The organizers achieve this through assisting aboriginal women in developing positive life narratives and positive community connections through the use of media and technologies. The program helps to empower women participants as they transition into different educational or employment opportunities.", "I recently visited the centre and attended one of their sessions. I was immediately impressed and captivated by the women I met and the enormous impact the program has on their lives. The women I met came from different places and backgrounds. They ranged in age from their early twenties to their fifties. They had all overcome their own individual adversities, but they all shared a common goal to succeed in the next chapter of their lives. It was clear this new program was helping them to do just that.", "I would like to commend Nokee Kwe and the organizers of the Positive Voice program for providing women the opportunity to share their stories, develop their skills and find the confidence in their ability to succeed." ],

  "text" : [ "I welcome the opportunity to present some of my thoughts here today about, as was mentioned, Bill 45. The short title is Election Statute Law Amendment Act, 2016. I’d like to present some of my thoughts on voting machines, which is contained within this legislation. When I say “my thoughts”—and I think it goes without saying for all of us present in the chamber—I’m trying to present what I think people in my riding, for example, may be thinking. It’s always our challenge—what are the thoughts of 110,000 people? I have my own views. I do chat with people. I do hear a bit on the ground about voting machines and the potential advantages and disadvantages, potential for fraud.", "There’s one key aspect, in my view, and I feel this applies to all of us here as elected representatives. I describe myself as an elected representative. There are other words for us, but I don’t commonly use them. I consider myself an elected representative. And what’s very, very important: As an elected representative, I have to represent the views of those who elected me—not only those who elected me but other people in the riding. Many people who come into our constit offices probably didn’t elect me—probably didn’t vote for me. I’ve observed that over the last 21 years or so. But it’s our job to represent everyone, whether they vote for us or not, obviously. Hence, it’s so important, as elected representatives are chosen in the province of Ontario—two will be chosen in the coming weeks in by-elections. It’s so important that we have confidence in the integrity of the processes that are used in our parliamentary democracy to choose these people.", "We live in what has been designed to be a fair and open democracy. I will quote the last phrase of the Speaker’s prayer: “where freedom prevails and justice rules.” That phrase is very important to me. I can tell you, over the last 10 years, that phrase is very important for people in Caledonia. I was with people from Caledonia on the weekend. All they asked for, over the last 10 years, was a system, a government, an environment for them where freedom prevails and justice rules.", "It actually boiled down to core values. Really, all the people in Caledonia asked for was peace, order and good government. That’s all they wanted. They weren’t necessarily looking for government grants or things like that in the presence of what was a very significant crisis with respect to our various institutions of not only government but also, attendant to that, policing and the court system.", "As we know, each morning we commence our deliberations by praying. It has been the case for centuries, as I understand, in our British system. We have more than one prayer. I mentioned the Speaker’s prayer.", "Again, when I see clauses and sections in this legislation that talk about voting machines, it’s incumbent on all of us to ensure that if there is a new system brought in beyond the paper ballot, beyond the time-tested issue of scrutineers counting the paper, it would obviously be plugged into electricity. That voting system has to ensure that what will continue is an environment where freedom prevails and justice rules. Anything that compromises that—I wouldn’t favour this legislation if it opens up any possibility at all of fraud.", "I think of the 110,000 people who live in my riding. We live along Lake Erie. Many people listen to radio coming out of Buffalo. We’ve always watched television coming out of Buffalo and Erie, Pennsylvania. In fact, when my children were born, my wife and I made a conscious decision. We didn’t want them growing up watching television, so we had a couple of very small TV sets with rabbit ears. Some of them were black and white. My kids hate black-and-white television. The rabbit ears really didn’t pick up much. We could get CHCH TV in Hamilton, and Erie, Pennsylvania, and that was about it.", "As with many people in my riding, much of our information comes from US media. I get the impression that just about everybody in my riding is watching what is going on with the Republican, Democrat and other parties contest south of the border. They are hearing about the concerns with election fraud, the concerns around voting machines. The advice that is given out for people when they vote, because of this danger of fraud and somebody rigging the system—people are being encouraged in the United States and these various—and I find the American voting system so complicated. They seem to be voting for every Tom, Dick and Harry when they go into the booth, whatever they do.", "I find it really takes me aback that people are being advised in the US elections coming up and in the advance polls—the vote-early system—to take a picture of their vote before they send it in, because there is a lack of trust. We can’t go down that road, courtesy of this legislation, if there’s any danger of that happening up here.", "Obviously, we’ve got the freedom to vote for whoever we want in our free and democratic society. You can vote for a communist, you can vote for a capitalist or a socialist or a social libertarian or obviously a Liberal or a Conservative, or you don’t have to vote at all. The beauty of the system is that nobody is holding a gun to your head.", "We have the freedom to vote in a secret ballot—I think that’s a fantastic invention—where only you and your God know what you did in that ballot booth or in those little cardboard three-fold systems. Once you walk in there, nobody is telling you how to vote—obviously not Big Brother, not your boss or your union boss or your husband or your wife or your kids. It’s a secret. You vote, and you put trust in a system with your single vote.", "There is that—I guess it’s an old expression now—one man, one vote; now, one person, one vote. I guess we still can use the term “person”; that may change in the future as well. But you know that your vote will count. It will be counted and it will be tabulated and it will be scrutinized in a fair and neutral and objective manner.", "Fraud has been present in our elections for as long as anybody can remember. We’ve had scrutineers for as long as you can remember. I can recall being a scrutineer—gosh, I don’t know—40 or 50 years ago, probably. A neutral, objective system: no hanky-panky, no jiggery pokery or manipulation of any kind by man or machine or some kind of computerized or mathematical algorithm. We must have confidence in our elections, Speaker.", "As I mentioned, during the recent US contest and going back before what’s going on now, going back to the Democratic primaries, apparently there were noticeable differences—I think that’s another way of saying “irregularities”—between hand-counting and machine-counting. In Brooklyn—did I pronounce that correctly?" ],

Does it lie in going back to paper?", "Some European countries actually are ahead of us, in the sense that they brought in voting machines. Something like seven or nine European countries—again, this is just what I read; I didn’t go over there and monitor the results—have banned the machines. They’ve gone back to paper. A high court in Germany—this was back in 2009—ordered the banning of election machines. So where does the future lie in Ontario? A number of European countries are getting rid of these electronic machines.

How could it be that there are 107 of us and, frankly, we have no First Nation representation? We have no MPP who can stand in this House right now and say proudly that they belong to a First Nation, and that’s pretty sad.", "The goal of the bill is rather honourable. They want to make sure that First Nations have a seat. But the way we have this drafted in the bill is, with all due respect, a white-person lens onto a First Nation issue. When, right in the bill, it says that only Kenora–Rainy River and Timmins–James Bay will be looked at, you have defined geographically two huge northern ridings that encompass quite a few First Nations, but there are also First Nations in the north that are in the riding of Thunder Bay–Superior North; there are First Nations in Thunder Bay–Atikokan; and there are First Nations in the north part of my riding of Nickel Belt as well as Algoma–Manitoulin.", "If you look at how First Nations organizations exist right now in Ontario, you have two tribal councils and you have three treaty organizations. It doesn’t matter which one you look at. Whether you look at the tribal councils, which would be the Treaty 3 council or the Nishnawbe Aski Nation council—they do not follow the boundaries that we have limited them to in the bill. I don’t understand why the bill specifically puts a geographical limit as to how First Nations will be represented. Why don’t we talk to them, take that out of the bill and keep the end goal, which is very good? The end goal is that we want to make sure that First Nations are represented in this Legislature. But let’s respect the travelling routes that already exist. Let’s respect the organizations that already exist.", "The reality on the ground, Speaker, is that most of northern Ontario is only accessible by air. Unless you are phenomenally rich, own your own plane and have enough money to fly this plane, there is no way for those people to get together in the way that we see them going together. But the people who live there are already organized. They’re organized by treaty and they’re organized by council, and we should respect that and not limit them to two geographical areas of ridings that happen to be the ridings of two of my colleagues, Kenora–Rainy River and Timmins–James Bay. It works really good for us. It doesn’t bother the white guy, and all is good. But it misses the boat.

It will bring you to an airport in what is called the white man’s land, not to another First Nation.", "So whether we look at Treaty 3—Treaty 3 is mainly Ojibway—most of them are accessible by road, and those would be the people around Kenora and Fort Frances and Sioux Lookout and all of that area of the northwest, part of the Kenora–Rainy River riding right now.", "Treaty 5 is in the extreme west part of our province, and Treaty 5 really expands into Manitoba just as much as it does into Ontario.

We want to have First Nations representatives working with us and beside us. We think that it is a good idea to change, to have a look at this.

They certainly would have opportunities to do political work so that people who would be called to the polls would know those people and would know what they stand for. But if we arbitrarily decide who is in and who is out, where will the district end? We have those two big northern ridings that exist. Without taking into account that their organizations also take parts of my riding, of the Algoma–Manitoulin riding, of the Thunder Bay–Superior North riding and of the Thunder Bay–Atikokan riding, we are missing the boat.

I can tell you right now that when I see in the bill limitations to the representation on the Far North Electoral Boundaries Commission, the limits we have put on them, that it could only be one or two ridings, that they have to find those ridings within the two existing ridings that have been made by us, the white people, for them, that’s not in the spirit of reconciliation, that’s not in the spirit of good collaboration. The chances of getting it right when you start with a mandate that has it wrong are pretty slim, Speaker. We want this to be a success.", "We have such a long, long list of good intentions towards First Nations people that have gone completely wrong. I’d like to put on the record one such organization. It is an ongoing issue. I had the opportunity to talk with the minister responsible, who also called his parliamentary assistant. Those good intentions have gone off the rails and done the exact opposite of what we wanted them to do. It basically starts with Mrs. Debra Dupuis, who wanted to have a monument to honour Charles Henry Byce, who is a veteran from the Second World War. He also happens to be a survivor of a residential school. He comes from Chapleau and belongs to the Chapleau Cree—which, by the way, would not be captured by the limits that we have put on.", "Basically, what happened was that this spring, Mrs. Dupuis was attending a function with the mayor of Parry Sound. The Premier was there. While the Premier was there, the Premier reached out to Mrs. Dupuis, who was in charge of the Charles Henry Byce commemoration, and asked her, “How can we help you? How can the province of Ontario help you?” Which was goodwill, good intentions and a good goal. Basically, Mrs. Dupuis told them that they had this project, an over $100,000 project that the federal government had agreed to fund about $111,000, they had put forward a big fundraising effort to bring this monument to Chapleau, and they would like the province to contribute about $20,000 to the project. The Premier was very enthusiastic. She loved the idea of doing this monument in the spirit of reconciliation so that you have the opportunity to honour First Nations. What could go wrong?", "Well, it did go wrong. The Premier first asked Mr. Phil Donelson to connect with the group to see how they could help. He first referred the group to Mr. Janeiro. Mrs. Dupuis quickly told them that they had already gone to the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport, as I think it’s called now; they had gone to the Ministry of Tourism, who had made it clear that they had no way to fund their project. Mr. James Janeiro exchanged phone calls and emails and made it clear that this was not going to work.", "On August 18, they get a phone call to say that they would be receiving a funding letter and that they would hear from the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport. The details would be in the letter of what he called “one-off funding.” He did not at the time say the specific dollar amount, but she had made it clear when she met the Premier that they needed about $20,000.", "The date for the unveiling of the new monument to Charles Henry Byce came and went. Just before the unveiling, they get this phone call that the ministry, the province, is not going to give them the funds. Had they told them that from the start, the fundraising committee would have continued to fundraise throughout the summer to make sure that they had enough money to cover the cost of the commemorations as well as the plaque and the beautiful monument that was done. But no. The Premier had reached out, had asked how they could help, had put them in contact with people in their office who promised them that they would make it happen, that they would receive the money. Only a few days before the event was about to take place do they hear that, no, they were reneging on this promise, that it was not going to happen.", "The unveiling celebration was a beautiful thing. National Chief Perry Bellegarde was there. The commander of the Canadian Army was there. Joseph Boyden was there, and the province was represented as well. It was a very proud moment.", "But the First Nations felt like they had been let down. Why were they strung on, up to the last minute, to say that the province understood how important it was and in the spirit of reconciliation was going to help them achieve this great commemoration ceremony? And then, at the last minute, they let them down.", "This is not how you build reconciliation. This is not how you consult and learn from the First Nations. We have an opportunity in this bill to do things right, to achieve our end goal of bringing new ridings that are mainly representative of hard-to-reach First Nations communities—but not the way we have it set up right now; not the way we have it set up that does not take anything into account. It does not take the geography into account. It does not take the natural traffic, travelling patterns or possibilities, into account. It does not take the existing political council into account. It does not take into account the existing treaty. It does not take into account their language, because not every First Nation speaks the same language. We have Ojibway; we have Oji-Cree; we have Cree. And they’re already organized, but we want to impose upon them how they’re going to campaign and be active politically at the provincial level. Not a winning combination whatsoever.", "So, the Ontario Native Education Counselling Association, a non-profit registered charity with indigenous students at the forefront of its mission—had undertaken this project of honouring Charles Henry Byce in the spirit of building education and reconciliation that they had been working on for many years.

Today, I reached across to the minister in charge of indigenous relations and reconciliation, as well as his PA, and I had yet another talk with them about this. The minister was just in estimates, where I had time to question him about this issue. He was quite adamant that he understood; that the province had done wrong when it came to First Nations; that they were going to look at this and that they were going to fix it. On two occasions, he promised me that, and none of that has happened. Good intentions are not enough. It also has to become reality.", "I have the Hansard from October 4, where I speak to the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation and where I bring back this issue, and where Minister Zimmer, the Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, makes it clear that they have intentions of following back. He says, “Let me go back to the office, and the deputy and I will look into this and provide you and Ms. Patrick with what we can provide.” He goes on to say, “Let me look into it and develop the facts, but I assure you that I will endeavour to do what I can as soon as I can.”", "This was almost a month ago, and if it were not for me reaching out to them once again, all would have been lost and forgotten.", "We have to do better, Speaker, when it comes to relationships with our First Nations partners.

This has to be looked at. This has to be changed.", "Not last week but the week before, we had the chief of Wahnapitae First Nation with the deputy regional grand chief come to Queen’s Park.

Over 30 great big tanker cars derailed, exploded, caught fire and spilled a total of over four million litres of crude.

They have a fishery. They have very active outfitters in tourism. All of this is at risk since the derailment took place in March 2015.", "Until the fall of 2015, CN was a good corporate citizen. They were at the site daily. I made monthly—and sometimes weekly—visits to the site: They were there. They were trying to clean the shore. They were trying to clean the water. They removed all of the soil that had been contaminated. They put big berms to limit where the oil could go. They took everything—every blade of grass, every speck of sand—out of there to be cleaned, brought it down to either the rock or down to the water table, if there was water coming up. They did as good as they could to clean.", "When they were still there and I was last there, in October 2015, they had big dredging to go to the bottom of the river. They had actual people in scuba diving gear with some kind of an underwater vacuum who were going to the bottom of the river, to try to get as much of the oil out as possible.", "The people of Mattagami were there on the site, the people of Gogama were there on the site and it looked like things were going to get cleaned up.", "Then came winter. With winter came five feet of ice. Then spring came. In the spring of 2016, as soon as the water started flowing again, it was obvious to anybody who bothered to have a look that there was still a lot of oil in the water.", "Chad, who is in charge for the Mattagami First Nation, as well as Mr. Benson, who is in charge for Gogama, repeatedly reached out to the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change. The Mattagami First Nation reached out to the Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation as well as to the Premier to ask them to mandate CN to continue cleaning, because you know what, Speaker? We have it within our powers that the Legislative Assembly can mandate CN to continue the cleaning. But to no avail. There were no meetings taking place. There was no acknowledgment that those people wanted to be heard, that they wanted action from this government. Nothing was done.", "What does that mean? That means that Chief Walter Naveau and fire chief Mike Benson had to go all the way from Mattagami First Nation and all the way from Gogama and come down here so they would have an opportunity to be heard.", "This is not what reconciliation is about, Speaker. Reconciliation is about being respectful of the others. It’s listening to what the others have to say. In this particular instance, the other is a First Nation called Mattagami, and nobody has listened to them. Nobody has answered their call. Nobody has agreed to a meeting request.", "I have hand-delivered meeting invitations to the minister. I have talked to the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change dozens of times about this issue, and still no action. That’s not how we get reconciliation, Speaker—quite the opposite.", "Then came one other missed opportunity. This other missed opportunity is for Wahnapitae First Nation. We’re talking about a bill called Bill 45, the Election Statute Law Amendment Act. We’re going to change the Election Act in Ontario for all sorts of good reasons, and in large part based on the Chief Electoral Officer himself, who has made recommendations—all good. But a recommendation that the Chief Electoral Officer said that only this legislation can take is to put Wahnapitae First Nation in the right riding.", "Last year we had Bill 115, An Act to enact the Representation Act, 2015, repeal the Representation Act, 2005 and amend the Election Act, the Election Finances Act and the Legislative Assembly Act. Basically, last year we voted on adding more ridings to the province of Ontario to more or less mirror what the federal government had done. What an opportunity. We were changing the boundaries of dozens of ridings. What an opportunity to put Wahnapitae First Nation in the right riding.", "Wahnapitae is a very small First Nation. It’s one square kilometre. That’s it; that’s all. Their traditional territory is huge, but the First Nation itself is one square kilometre on the west shore of beautiful Lake Wanapitei —therefore their name, Wahnapitae First Nation.", "Wanapitei Lake is a huge lake. You can see it on any map of Ontario, it is so big. It is within the boundaries of the city of Greater Sudbury. It is in the riding of Nickel Belt at the federal level. I have my constituency office for the riding of Nickel Belt—you go to Capreol, which is about 20 kilometres away, and Wahnapitae First Nation is just beside Capreol. They come to my office all the time.", "But for reasons unknown, they have been put in the riding of Timiskaming–Cochrane. Some really knowledgeable people in southern Ontario looked at this vast amount of crown land and said, “There’s nobody there. Who cares if we put them in one riding or in another riding? Nobody lives there north of Lake Wanapitei.” So they went and put this big swath of land down as if it belongs to the riding of Timiskaming–Cochrane.", "The problem is, Speaker, that there are people who live there. The good people of Wahnapitae First Nation have lived there forever on end, but yet, somebody had decided that they were going to be part of Timiskaming–Cochrane. During an election, they have to go through the riding of Nickel Belt and then the riding of Sudbury to make it to the riding of Timiskaming–Cochrane. We are talking hundreds of kilometres to make it to the riding of Timiskaming–Cochrane, or about 25 kilometres to make it to my office. This makes no sense.", "We were discussing changing the boundaries of dozens of ridings. What an opportunity to finally right this wrong. It was Madeleine Meilleur, the Attorney General, who was in charge of this bill, so I went to see her. I showed her the letter that the current chief, Chief Roque, had written to her, saying that he wanted his First Nation to be in the riding of Nickel Belt. I showed her the letter that the previous chief had written. I showed her the letter that two chiefs back had written about this, because this mistake was done in 2005. “Oh, I get it,” and she promised it will be done. While we’re changing all of the boundaries for all of the other ones in the south, we will make sure that this one change to the boundaries of the ridings in the north is going to be taken into account, especially in the spirit of reconciliation with the First Nations.", "I didn’t take any chances. When it was my chance to talk about Bill 115, I used my entire 20 minutes to talk about Wahnapitae First Nation, why they had been done wrong and why it was important for Wahnapitae First Nation to be brought back into the riding of Nickel Belt, like it is at the federal level and like it makes sense on the ground.", "Everybody agreed. It went through committee. In committee, it was the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane, who happens to be the NDP member on that committee, who brought forward the amendment so that this could be corrected, as the Attorney General, Madame Meilleur, had assured me it would go. Then we had five members of the Liberals on the other side, nodding their head that it was not going to go through. When it came time to vote, they voted not to.", "Really? This is the spirit of reconciliation? We have been working on this since 2005. Everybody agrees that it was a mistake. Everybody agrees as to what is the correction. The correction is you take that one kilometre square and you put it in the riding of Nickel Belt, not in the riding of Timiskaming–Cochrane, which is hundreds of kilometres away, and case closed—but, no. All five members of the Liberals voted no. Their reason to vote no was that it was going to open a floodgate from other First Nations who wanted to be moved from one riding to the next.", "Not to be outdone, Speaker, I personally wrote to every single First Nation in Ontario. Do you know how many of them want to move ridings? One: Wahnapitae First Nation. The other 150-some First Nations are quite happy to be in the riding that they are in now.", "So now we have this opportunity again. We’re going to be changing the boundaries of some northern ridings. But right now, the way the bill is written, only the riding of Kenora–Rainy River and the riding of Timmins–James Bay can be changed. This doesn’t work for First Nations people in northern Ontario. It doesn’t work for the people of Wahnapitae. It doesn’t work for the Cree of Chapleau. It doesn’t work for a long, long series of people.", "The end goal is we want to be respectful to them. We want to show our true spirit of reconciliation, and we want them to be represented. We want them to come to Queen’s Park and be part of law-making, and be part of the discussion that takes place at Queen’s Park. But we have a bill that will not allow us to do this.", "I cannot believe, after everything that was said about Bill 115, after all the work that was done by Wahnapitae First Nation, by its chief, by the regional grand chief, that we cannot move this forward.", "We have an opportunity. We have a bill that opens up the boundaries of northern ridings. We have Wahnapitae First Nation, that has made the case over and over and over, as to this mistake.", "First of all, it’s quite disrespectful to think that somebody who has enough power to decide where the boundaries should go did not have enough knowledge to realize that there were people who lived there. It’s a little bit scary when you think about it, isn’t it, Speaker? When the boundaries were being talked about, it was clear that Wahnapitae First Nation was part of Nickel Belt at the federal level and that Wahnapitae First Nation’s people were going to receive their services from Nickel Belt at the provincial level. Everybody agreed. But when the person who drafted the bill did the drafting, they did not know that Wahnapitae existed. They did not know that good people lived there. And frankly, they did not care to find out.", "But this has been a bone of contention. This has been an irritant for this First Nation ever since, so their band council passed a motion. Their band council came and talked to the ministry—it used to be aboriginal affairs; it is now indigenous relations and reconciliation—and they were given a big smile: “We will work on it. We understand. We want to respect you.” They say all of the right words but take no action. And when they have an opportunity to take action, they vote against it.", "What exactly in there is reconciliation, Speaker? What exactly in there could make anybody feel good? The fact that nobody knew they existed? The fact that they are told that they understand that this was an error and they will correct it at the first possible opportunity, but when the opportunity comes they vote it down? Or the fact that we have a second bill that will look at riding boundaries, specifically on northern riding boundaries, but written in such a way that will again be impossible for Wahnapitae to be put in the right riding?", "You cannot say that you want reconciliation and then act in a way that pokes them in the eye, in a way that is completely disrespectful. This is not how you build a good, stable communication and a relationship with anybody, including the people of First Nations. We have an opportunity to do things right. Why put in the bill something like this?", "First of all, it’s not something that the Chief Electoral Officer ever asked to be done. It’s not like this is a recommendation, because most of the rest of the bill—Bill 45, Election Statute Law Amendment Act—came directly from the Chief Electoral Officer, who wants those changes. He wants those changes in place in time for the next election, on June 7, 2018. This one, about looking at creating one or two new ridings to accommodate First Nations’ voices, does not come from his recommendations. It comes from the government that wrote the bill. How can you keep making the same mistake over and over?", "You have an opportunity to be good on your word. You have an opportunity to correct what you have already admitted to them many times over by many different Ministries of Aboriginal Affairs—because it seems like every 18 months we get a new Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs. They’ve met with each and every one of them. Even the one with the new title, the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, told the exact same thing with the big smile. “We want to work with you. We understand.” Then they write a bill that misses the boat completely, that is completely disrespectful, and that showed one more time that they don’t exist, they don’t matter, and nobody cares.", "I care about the people of Wahnapitae. They’re pretty good people. Actually, I invite all of my colleagues to come to the Wahnapitae First Nation. They are on the side of a beautiful lake, Lake Wanapitei. They have a beautiful band office. Most of the people who belong to Wahnapitae First Nations have gone to school in the environmental sciences, so they have this huge consultant firm for the environment. They are very knowledgeable in everything that has to do with the environment, as taught in Ontario universities, but also as taught through the First Nation knowledge. They’re able to marry this together to make work that is just phenomenal. They are retained by all of the mining around—whenever something’s going on that needs to have environmental assessments done or recommendations, Wahnapitae First Nation’s consultants are the top. They’re very fun to work with. They work within, I would say, their traditional way of doing things but always with a twist and always interesting.", "If you have an opportunity, they are really, really welcoming. I guarantee you, if any MPP wants to come and visit Wahnapitae First Nation, Chief Roque will welcome you with open arms and will show you a First Nation like you have never seen before. It is a northern First Nation. It is close to Nickel Belt, but in the wrong riding. They have a lot to teach us, and we have a lot to learn. We have a lot to learn from each other.", "So, please, do come. Once you see it, it will become obvious that they do not belong in Timiskaming–Cochrane. They have nothing in common with Timiskaming–Cochrane. Timiskaming–Cochrane has a lot of farming and agriculture. For them, they are in the heart of the Canadian Shield. If there is ever a centre point of the Canadian Shield, it may be them. We live on a pile of rocks, and we’re very proud of it. It’s just beautiful. So I do invite you to come and see. Hopefully, that will motivate the Liberal government to make the changes to that bill and, when the changes come forward, to find it in their heart to vote in favour of moving Wahnapitae First Nation from the riding of Timiskaming–Cochrane to the riding of Nickel Belt where they belong.", "That being said, I have always served the people of Wahnapitae First Nation. If they need help from their provincial government, I do help them. I have no problem with this because my colleague is also from the NDP, and we work together. Unfortunately, it was not always the case. When I was first elected, it was a member from a different party that was representing Timiskaming–Cochrane. Then, it was rather difficult because they would come to me—I have no problem helping them—but then we would run into conflicts with who should be doing the work. Nobody needs that. We happen to have the NDP that represents both ridings right now. It won’t be like this forever. We have a chance to fix it. Let’s not let another chance go by. Let’s fix this mistake so that we never have to live with this again.", "I wanted to spend some time this afternoon talking about one part of the bill, as I said, the part that was not brought forward by the election officer but that was brought forward by the will of the government. I thank the government for bringing this part into the bill. As I said, it’s a good goal, but let’s make sure that we reach that goal. In order to make sure that we reach that goal, we have to respect the geography, the transportation and the associations, political or treaty, that already exist in the northwest and the northeast of our province and not limit them to those two ridings. We have to fix Wahnapitae.", "Another part that I wish would have been in the bill—oh, and just to make sure, I will also be introducing a bill about Wahnapitae First Nation just to make absolutely sure that everybody knows what needs to happen to correct this. I’m in contact with Chief Roque, and he will be attending as well to make sure that the next time around, we don’t continue to perpetuate this mistake and we actually fix things.", "The next thing I wanted to talk about is that we have talked a lot about how we get elected. This act is the Election Statute Law Amendment Act, and it obviously talks about how people get elected in Ontario. It will make a long list of changes.", "It will change the date of the election. The election will now be on the first Thursday in June, so the next election will be June 7, 2018. We already know that.", "It will make a voluntary registry of eligible 16- and 17-year-olds. Here, again, I think this is a pretty good thing to get our youth interested in politics. It will probably make our lists a little bit more accurate when it comes to people who are 18 years old voting for the first time.", "I think my predecessor talked about some vote-counting equipment that will be allowed.", "They will also bring penalties for owners of residential buildings who deny access to canvassers. I must say that, coming from Nickel Belt, I have one high-rise, and the owner is pretty open to anybody going to canvass. It’s not going to change much for my riding of Nickel Belt. But I understand that there’s not only Nickel Belt in this province; there are many, many ridings that have many high-rises, and that will make it easier for them to canvass.", "They will also put an ID to each eligible voter.", "It changes how the Chief Electoral Officer can communicate.", "It changes some of the privacy statements as well.", "Political parties will be able to opt out of receiving elector information.", "The candidates can request that the surnames that they commonly use be found on the ballots, because a lot of people use a shortened version of their names when they canvass, and that’s what they’re known under.", "The returning officer hours and days would be standardized so that it becomes easier for everybody to know, during election night as well as during the advance polls.", "The nomination process of candidates will be easier.", "It changes the electoral advertising blackout.", "It allows parties with fewer than two nominated candidates during a general election to be registered.", "It changes a number of things. Most of them make sense. All of them have been brought forward by the Chief Electoral Officer. I would say that for some of the recommendations, he has been making those recommendations for a long, long time. So, as I said, most of the changes in that legislation would make sense.", "The part that is not in there and I think should have been has to do with how we elect people. Right now, we use first-past-the-post. With first-past-the-post, both in 2015 and 2011, the government won a majority with only 39% of the vote. Or, if you look at it with the glass half-empty, that means that 61% of people wanted someone else in government. But with the first-past-the-post voting system, we get that kind of result.", "There are five things to know about proportional representation. Our current first-past-the-post system was around before we had cars, before we had electricity and before penicillin was even invented or thought of. It would give what people call a “false majority.” As I said, at the federal level both the Liberals in 2015 and the Conservatives in 2011 had those false majorities, with only 39% of the vote going to them. So what would that do? Well, proportional representation would mean that if a party gets about 20% of the vote, they would get about 20% of the seats, and there’s a few things that would work differently.", "Proportional representation is popular. There are over 90 countries that use a proportional representation voting system, including 85% of the OECD countries, such as Ireland, Germany, Scotland, Wales, Sweden and Denmark. Proportional representation usually means higher voter turnout. Research shows that voter turnout is 5% to 7.5% higher on average in countries that use proportional representation. It also leads to a more diverse and gender-balanced Parliament. Countries that use proportional representation have more diverse Parliaments, with more individuals from underrepresented groups.", "Countries that have more than 30% of women in their Legislature use proportional representation and countries that use proportional representation see up to 8% more women in their Legislatures compared to first-past-the-post. It does not lead to instability or never-ending elections. If you look at the Canadian government, under first-past-the-post we’ve had more elections since World War II than Germany, Ireland, Sweden and Spain, all countries that do use proportional representation. So this argument doesn’t hold. And you can still have a local MPP. So you vote for somebody to represent you in your riding locally, and then the rest of the votes are given to people on party lists.", "If we are going to see an Election Statute Law Amendment Act, I would have liked that Ontario at least start this conversation. I would say, Speaker, that there is pent-up demand by the people of Ontario to look at something else. With voter turnout during Ontario elections hovering at about 50%, that is nothing to be proud of. That means that for 50% of the people of Ontario what goes on in here doesn’t matter. It does not motivate them enough to go put an X on a piece of paper. That’s pretty sad.", "When I see this Legislative Assembly talk about changing the election rules, why don’t we give people what they want us to talk about? Ontarians want us to talk about other models of elections and getting elected, and this bill is completely silent on that.", "I see that time is running out.", "Ça me fait toujours plaisir de pouvoir participer aux débats sur les différents projets de loi dont nous parlons ici. Pour le projet de loi—qui a quand même un nom assez long—qui s’appelle la Loi visant à modifier certaines lois en ce qui concerne les élections provinciales, si on y regarde, une partie de cette loi qui m’intéressait beaucoup est la partie qui nous parle : « Une modification apportée à la Loi de 2015 sur la représentation électorale prévoit la formation de la Commission de délimitation des circonscriptions électorales du Grand Nord, qui a pour mandat d’examiner les limites des circonscriptions électorales de Kenora–Rainy River et de Timmins–Baie James et de faire des recommandations quant à la création d’une ou de deux circonscriptions supplémentaires dans cette région géographique. »", "C’est très désappointant de voir que, tout de suite, dans le texte de la loi, on a mis des frontières géographiques qui ne tiennent pas compte des besoins des gens des Premières Nations qui demeurent là. Si tu regardes aux gens des Premières Nations qui demeurent là, on a déjà des organismes qui sont en place. Il y a des traités qui existent, que l’on parle du traité numéro 3—qui représente surtout les Premières Nations qui parlent Ojibway et qui est situé autour de Fort Frances, Sioux Lookout, Kenora, dans ce bout-là. Après ça, il y a le traité numéro 5. Le traité numéro 5 est celui qui est au nord et le plus à l’ouest de l’Ontario, tellement à l’ouest que le traité numéro 5 s’en va beaucoup dans le Manitoba.", "Puis, après ça, il y a le traité numéro 9. Le traité numéro 9 est un grand traité, qui a deux sections : il y en a une qui s’est faite aux alentours de 1909; une autre un peu plus tard. C’est un grand traité qui couvre des Premières Nations autant dans Timmins–Baie James que dans Nickel Belt, que dans Algoma–Manitoulin, que dans Thunder Bay–Superieur-Nord et Thunder Bay–Atikokan.", "Mais la façon dont le projet de loi est écrit, c’est que seulement certaines parties de ces traités—seulement certaines parties—vont faire partie des débats. Le projet de loi, lorsqu’il sera adopté, a mis en place une commission, mais une commission qui part avec un mandat perdant, parce que c’est un mandat qui lui est imposé et qui ne respecte pas ce qui existe déjà.", "La communication entre les gens des Premières Nations qui demeurent dans une Première Nation qui est accessible seulement par avion—la communication est très difficile. Pour la plupart des gens qui demeurent dans ces communautés, sortir de la communauté veut dire au moins 1 000 $ pour des billets d’avion. On peut voir que, pour quelqu’un qui essaierait de faire de la cabale d’une Première Nation à l’autre, à moins que tu aies ton propre avion et beaucoup d’argent pour te payer beaucoup d’essence, ce serait quasiment impossible.", "Mais les gens qui demeurent là ont déjà des associations, ont déjà des moyens de communication, ont déjà des routes qui existent qui ne suivent pas les deux comtés qui ont été mis dans la loi. Les moyens de communication qui existent déjà et les moyens de rencontre qui existent déjà représentent des traditions qui sont là depuis assez longtemps—plus de 100 ans—et ne respectent pas les limites géographiques que le gouvernement a voulu leur donner.", "Donc, j’aimerais que le gouvernement écoute et change le projet de loi pour s’assurer que la commission aura le droit de regarder à tout le territoire voulu pour que les Premières Nations aient une chance d’être écoutées, aient une chance d’être respectées et aient une chance d’être représentées ici à Queen’s Park. À la fin de la journée, c’est assez honteux que, bien que les Premières Nations représentent un pourcentage significatif de la population de l’Ontario, on ne les retrouve nulle part ici dans l’Assemblée.", "Le projet de loi essaie de faire ça, mais on ne vote pas sur des bonnes intentions. On vote sur ce qui a été écrit dans le projet de loi, et ce qui a été écrit dans le projet de loi n’est pas respectueux des Premières Nations.", "J’en profite également pour mettre de l’avant une autre erreur qui a été faite, et ça, c’est avec la Première Nation de Wahnapitae. La Première Nation de Wahnapitae est dans le comté de Timiskaming–Cochrane, ce qui veut dire que pour avoir accès à leur député, ils doivent passer au travers du comté de Nickel Belt et du comté de Sudbury pour se rendre jusqu’à Timiskaming–Cochrane.", "Au niveau fédéral, c’est clair : la nation de Wahnapitae est dans Nickel Belt. On a eu la chance de faire changer ça lorsqu’on a parlé du projet de loi 115 l’année dernière. Après avoir fait des promesses—ils comprenaient que c’était une erreur qui devait être corrigée—les Libéraux ont voté contre la motion qui avait été faite par mon collègue de Timiskaming–Cochrane. Bien qu’ils nous ont dit, oui, qu’ils étaient pour changer ça, ils ont voté contre. Ils ont, en ce moment, une autre opportunité de passer à l’action, de corriger cette erreur et de s’assurer que lorsqu’on changera les frontières pour les comtés du Nord, Wahnapitae sera dans le comté de Nickel Belt.", "Je vous remercie de m’avoir écouté, monsieur le Président.

Reforming Canada’s first-past-the-post voting system received decisive rejections in three provinces during the past decade, from Canada’s largest province by population, which is Ontario, to its smallest, which is Prince Edward Island, and two decisive thumbs-down votes by British Columbia.", "The fatal flaw in proportional representation is the assumption that if you pay more attention to the people and the parties that lost the election, you’ll get better government. The second fatal flaw in it is to assume that the function of a provincial Legislature is not to do something, but to talk about something. I think we’re here to do something as a Legislature." ],

They feel that they vote for a certain candidate because of what they stand for, and then when they get to the House, they feel that nothing is being done to address their concerns.", "Certainly a way to get more people involved in the voting process is for us to do more, or to do what our constituents put us here for, and that’s to represent them in this House. Maybe they will come away with the feeling—the feeling they have right now is “What’s the use in voting?” when we don’t represent them in this place. I’m sure that something we all have to address is that when we’re put here for a certain reason, we should address the concerns of our constituents and make sure that they feel important that way.

Ultimately, I think we want to increase the participation rate not only with youth but across Ontario. Many other jurisdictions have tried different approaches. For example, I believe in Australia, voting is actually mandatory in their federal elections and, in fact, subject to fines. There are other opportunities, for example. But I think we’re striking the right balance here with Bill 45.", "One of the things that I think is very encouraging—as an individual at home with both a 17-year-old and a 16-year-old, I think I’d better go and get them preregistered immediately. I think that’s a very progressive step that the government is taking. We’ll actually, as we said, pre-voter register so that these folks are in fact on the rolls and ready to vote in the next upcoming election.", "Why are we doing this? Well, as you will know, the participation rates in democracy, for various reasons, have been falling, perhaps globally. There seem to be just as many protests as voters out there. For example, in 2014, less than 52% of eligible voters actually voted in the province of Ontario.", "When you think of how important voting is—affecting your hospitals and your schools and your foreign policy and which jets the federal government will acquire etc.—I think it’s extremely important that all of us exercise that franchise.", "So whether we’re going to make standardized advance polling or preregister youth, we’re going to encourage democracy, and that’s a good thing, Speaker." ],

There is this section of the bill that will create the Far North Electoral Boundaries Commission. I would really like us to get this right. Because we have put a limit on their mandate—it’s limited to the riding of Kenora–Rainy River and the riding of Timmins–James Bay—we have failed to take into account that this is not the natural communication pattern of the First Nations who live in the Far North.", "The First Nations who live in the Far North are already organized. They have tribal councils; they have treaty councils; they get together. They are already organized. But their organizations do not match the geographical boundaries of the two ridings that exist. It has to be taken into account if we want it to be successful, because we’re talking about First Nations that belong to different treaties, that speak different languages and that work differently than what we’re trying to impose on them.", "I’m happy that we will have the Far North Electoral Boundaries Commission. Let’s give them a mandate that will succeed by giving them the right to make recommendations that will not only be limited to those two northern ridings but include all of the northern ridings if they so wish.", "My second part is that I cannot believe that we will, for the second time, open up the boundaries of ridings and not put Wahnapitae First Nation in the right riding.

I’ll be sharing my time with the member for Mississauga–Streetsville and with the President of the Treasury Board.", "Mr. Speaker, you as well as every other member of this Legislature and those who have sought to be members of this Legislature know the tremendous efforts that we and our teams put in during an election leading up to election day. I think we could all agree that there’s nothing more disappointing than to see that the voter turnout barely goes over 50%. All this effort to reach everyone in one’s riding, and yet almost half of the people choose not to participate, for whatever reason.", "The bill before us today seeks to make steps to try to improve that situation, to ensure that everyone’s franchise is not only guaranteed but that we take steps to encourage their franchise to be exercised and that we make it easier for them to exercise their franchise.", "One of the areas that this bill does focus on in a very meaningful way is our young people. Many 18-year-olds may or may not be interested in voting, but just the fact that they don’t know whether they’re on the voters list and don’t know how to get on the voters list—that might be a discouraging part of the process. With this bill, for the first time, we will be allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to be added to the voters list.", "This certainly is an opportunity through our high schools to engage with young people, teach them about the election process, about their role in it, their rights to be electors, and encourage them to be engaged several years before an election. I think that’s going to be a very powerful tool.", "All of us, I’m sure, in our respective ridings have encountered situations with inconvenience of the advance polling locations or the lack of certainty as to where they might be as they shift from election to election. By standardizing locations and hours, I think this is also going to be a positive benefit to all voters and to the entire electoral process.", "As was mentioned very eloquently by the previous speaker, there will be a Far North Electoral Boundaries Commission established, whose role is going to be to find ways to ensure that our northern communities are better engaged and better represented in the election process, and most certainly our indigenous peoples who very much deserve to ensure that they get excellent representation in this Legislature.", "It’s important to note that these amendments to the Election Act have come about as a result of careful consideration of recommendations of the chief elections officer, who has been very involved in giving us advice on improvements to the electrical—electoral process. Not the electrical process. That’s a debate for another day, but we do want to electrify the elections process to get more people excited and involved.", "A couple of things that I think are also important are about when we vote: We know that when we have fixed election dates, it’s easier for the participants in the electoral process to get organized, to energize their teams, but I think it’s also better for the general public. It’s better for the whole process of organizing the mechanics of the election, whether it’s advanced polling or other aspects of it. Certainly in the province of Ontario, where we have very often had provincial and municipal elections overlap, moving to a spring fixed election date is a very positive step and will also help to clarify for people who those pesky folks knocking on their doors are. Are they running for city hall, are they running for a school board or for the Legislature? This is an important step in ensuring that the process is very clear and fair to people.", "Another key part of the bill before us is the issue of using technology in the election process. We still very much have a 19th-century electoral system in the 21st century. The use of electronic voting lists connected electronically and interconnected is, I think, going to be a very important part of these reforms—and also the use of tabulators, which will greatly speed up the results. To those who question the efficacy of those election tabulators, my own experience running municipally in the city of Toronto, where those machines have been used for many years, is that they are excellent and they provide quick results. In those rare circumstances when there is a mechanical breakdown, you still have the ability to do a paper recount of the ballots in that machine. I experienced that myself in one election and it works, and it still provides for integrity in the system.", "All of these are very positive attributes of the bill, and I’m sure my colleague from Mississauga–Streetsville will elaborate further upon them." ],

But for all its falsely perceived demerits, the first-past-the-post system is stunningly simple, brutally effective and actually confers upon a government a mandate and an obligation to do something. It actually allows people to defeat their politicians or their parties.", "Never lose sight of this particular breathtaking benefit. To our US cousins who re-elect more than 90% of their politicians most years, the ability to make the type of sweeping change that Canadians regularly make at the federal and provincial levels is just a pipe dream.", "Canada’s system is a simple system that allows a level and, most importantly, a bare and an exposed playing field. I would caution people against introducing thickets of regulations, exceptions and special cases that make Canada’s electoral system a case of blaming the system when, in fact, it’s the government that just can’t do the job.", "A couple of things that my colleagues talked about—the move to a spring election from a fall election. I just want to speak a little bit as a candidate here. In the fall when you’re going door to door, each day is getting shorter and darker and colder. When you’re going door to door in the spring, the days are getting longer and brighter and warmer. For that reason alone, that’s a reform that I think is well worth considering. People are just in a better mood for a spring election. It doesn’t overlap any of the fall elections by either design or accident.", "There’s another reform that’s been proposed here, which is electronic voting lists. I think this one is also a good one. I think anything that enables us to get the same information that we would get manually with the same or a greater degree of integrity than we would get manually is a good thing. It enables a campaign organization to know who among those they’ve identified has actually gone out and voted, which allows a campaign team to not have to bother the same people again and again. They say, “But I’ve already voted. Will you take yes for an answer?” Being able to gain access to that information more quickly allows us to be more responsive and also more compassionate to the people we’re trying, having identified their preference, to get out to vote, to cash it in.", "As well, this bill proposes keeping the paper audit trail. One of the things that gives Canadian elections in general integrity is that audit trail. It means that an election is a process that’s very closely watched. It also means that both sides provide a check and a balance on one another. As a result, Canadian elections are exposed, Canadian elections are fair, and Canadian elections are honest.", "I say in this chamber to my colleagues, in all of the years that I’ve helped others and I’ve run myself, yes, I’ve seen signs pulled down and I’ve seen little dirty tricks here and there, but I have never seen any large-scale attempt to go out and disturb the integrity of the system of casting ballots and the system of counting ballots. I’d say Canadians can look at their electoral system and say, “This is an accurate reflection of the people who have come out to vote.”", "When I used to do work as one of Microsoft’s Most Valuable Professionals, every year they would bring us down to Redmond, Washington. One day, I remember asking the guy who at the time was developing the Windows product—Windows had 8,000 full-time developers working on it at the time. I and a few others asked, “How do you make decisions with a team that large?” What he said is something I wrote down, because I thought to myself, “He’s actually talking politics here.” He said the following: “First of all, we always make our decisions on time”—elections. And he said, “Decisions are made by people who show up”—voters. So the thing that we’re discussing here actually has a lot of parallels in the private sector.", "My personal wish, as we walk down this exercise of looking at the integrity of our system, is that we retain that integrity, we retain that transparency, and we retain that simplicity that allows people to know that the representatives they send are accountable to somebody and they’re also defeatable by somebody." ],

This is a really interesting act because we’re making some—not major, but significant—adjustments to how elections are held in Ontario. When you think about it, the right to vote, to exercise your right to vote, is really the foundation of our democracy, and it’s important that we think carefully about how we can continuously improve the way that we hold elections and who gets to vote.", "One of the challenges that we’ve seen lately is declining voter turnout. In the 2014 election, less than 52% of the people eligible to vote actually voted. When you look at young people, the number becomes even more disturbing. In the last election, only 34% of young people cast their ballot, even when they were registered and eligible to vote. So one of the challenges that we face is, how do we engage young people in the process of voting? We know that seniors have the highest voter turnout until they become quite elderly and infirm, but older people are more inclined to vote than young people in a really quite dramatic way.", "One of the things that we’re looking at is what’s called provisional registration of 16- and 17-year-olds. I don’t know whether my riding is a little bit unusual, but I actually have a fair bit of interaction with youth and young adults during election campaigns. For whatever reason, I always have at least three of the high schools in Guelph organize all-candidates meetings, and by definition when you do an all-candidates meeting at a high school, almost all of the audience can’t actually vote.", "But then also, because it’s a university town, as you’re going door to door, particularly in the south end of town, you run into a lot of students. Those students may or may not be registered to vote, and if they are registered to vote, it’s very likely that they’re not registered to vote in Guelph—that they are, if they are registered at all, registered someplace else. So this whole business of talking to people who are young and encouraging them to become involved in the electoral process is a reality that I have in every election campaign.", "One of the things that I always tell the university students and young people is that you really need to think about the dynamic that you’re setting up when you choose not to vote, because I know that as a politician, your grandparents are the people most likely to show up, then your parents and then you. That means, if the pages who are sitting here think about it, that if I do something that your grandparents want, they’re going to show up and vote about it. If I do something that your parents like or don’t like, they’re somewhat likely to show up and vote. But if I do something that young people like or don’t like, you’re probably not going to show up at all. So if you look at this from a really practical point of view, the people I really, really need to listen to are actually your grandparents, because your grandparents are almost guaranteed to show up and vote.", "That changes the way that politicians at whatever level—this isn’t just a provincial phenomenon; it’s a federal phenomenon, a provincial phenomenon, a school board phenomenon, a municipal phenomenon. It changes the way politicians think about what they’re going to promise to do, because they know that the people they really have to appeal to are the people who are a little bit older. We want to change that dynamic. We want to make sure that our young people are more engaged.", "The Chief Electoral Officer, if this bill passes, would be required to set up a process of provisional registration for 16- and 17-year-olds. We’re not changing the age at which people can vote; that stays at 18. But while kids are still in high school—the Chief Electoral Officer has said, “I’d like to engage with high schools”—there would be an opportunity to be provisionally registered as voters. Then, when they turn 18, they would be automatically transferred to the for-real voters list, and that registration would mean that they’re all ready to vote and participate. That’s one of the really interesting ideas that’s in this bill.", "My colleague mentioned the whole issue of spring election dates. This bill, if passed, would change the regular scheduled election date from the fall to the spring. The truth of the matter is that when you go door to door and you knock on doors in the fall after supper, it’s dark out, and people don’t really answer their doors to strangers in the dark—except tonight, when it’s Halloween. But normally, people don’t open the doors for strangers at night, so it makes it really difficult to canvass as you get closer to the election. The lovely thing about the unscheduled election that we had in June 2014 was that it was bright out in the evening, which meant that you actually got to go and talk to people, because they were quite happy to stand outside when it was nice and warm and talk to candidates about what it was that you as a candidate wanted to talk about.", "The other thing is, because of the slippage around the by-election, we know that if we have an election in the fall of 2018 we’re going to bump into municipal elections and federal elections, potentially. That just confuses people if you’ve got two or three different elections all going on at the same time. So what this bill would do is move the scheduled election date to the spring.", "One of the other things it does, and my colleague also talked to this a bit, was about the whole business of partially adopting technology. One of the other things that I notice is that in Guelph, because we have more commuters—well, this is true all over—we’ve changed the time that the polling stations are open so that it’s later in the evening. If you have to hand-count all those ballots, election day goes on forever. It’s getting to be very late at night by the time you know the results. Going to mechanical counting technology means that we can get the results a whole lot quicker and everybody can celebrate more and go to bed." ],

Of course, the first blackout period for by-elections and for non-scheduled general elections is to not permit the government to have an undue advantage over the opposition parties in elections, so it puts in a blackout period to even the playing field.

It’s absolutely horrendous. You know it yourself, every time you look at it. It’s put together by MPAC, and by MPAC’s own admission, they only get about 66% of it accurate. That’s the best they can do. Then they turn it over to the municipal officials and the election officials and they say, “This is the best we can do. Can you fix it?” Well, they don’t have the resources, they don’t have the time and they don’t have the money; they do what they can. But if the Wynne Liberals really want to get serious about putting on good elections, they would provide the resources to MPAC and the municipalities to finally have a good voters list that we can all depend on and improve on.

By the time we get through with this, it may well be too late for the staff training, to order the equipment, to have it all in place because we are running out of time.

We do face some very real challenges when it comes to voter turnout; we heard the President of the Treasury Board commenting on that. In the last election, on June 12, 2014, fewer than 52% of Ontarians bothered to vote—she mentioned that—and only 34% of youth cast a ballot.

The voting age would stay at 18, but we can reach out to youth while they’re still in school, while they’re learning about government, and get them registered and interested in the political process. Also, this pre-registration allows Elections Ontario the opportunity to contact them when they turn 18 with information on where and when they can vote. It makes them feel like they are part of the process and we’re reaching out to them. What we can also do for best practices is look to provinces like Quebec and Nova Scotia, where they already have pre-voter registration for 16- and 17-year-olds.", "This bill is also going to change the voting day from the fall to the spring.

There are a lot of people out there who are concerned when you say, “I’m going to go to an electronic system,” particularly those who have challenges with electronics. In a riding like Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, we still have pockets that can’t get electronic information, so a lot of people are of the mindset that, “I want to go in and do that ballot.”", "But I do support the electoral officer.

I want to call out the Attorney General, his parliamentary secretary and every other member of the Liberal caucus who gets up here and debates this bill suggesting that voter apathy is at the motivation of this bill, to undo that voter apathy and to motivate our youth to be engaged in the political process. I said it earlier: hooey, poppycock and balderdash to those comments. We’ll have nothing to do—", "But I do want to suggest, Speaker, that there are some elements in this bill that are not benign, that are not just technical in nature and actually do things that will create a position where the electoral playing field becomes skewed, and possibly even offensive in some ways.", "Before starting this debate today, I was down in committee with Bill 2, the election financing reform act. Smokey Thomas was in that committee. He was providing comments on the election financing reform, and it was interesting.

  "text" : [ "Yes, I agree. I spoke earlier, in questions and comments, about the blackout period. Here, right now, the government is prevented from advertising at the beginning of an unscheduled election or a by-election. The purpose and the rationale here are important for people to understand. This prevents the government from taking undue advantage because they are the ones who know when they’re going to schedule a by-election. It prevents them from using government money and using party money to advertise before the other parties even know there’s a by-election being called. What does Bill 45 do? It takes away that first blackout period. It gives advantage to the government and puts the opposition parties at a disadvantage. The Liberal government putting the opposition parties at a disadvantage and permitting itself to advertise before other parties: Is that going to turn more youth out to vote? I don’t think so. But I do know that it’s going to be a disadvantage to opposition members.", "Here’s another one. At the present time, it’s unlawful under the Election Act for schools to prevent their facilities from being used for polling purposes. It’s against the law. Schools have to provide their facilities as polling stations. This government, with this bill, will now make it twice offensive. It’s going to be an offence under the Education Act as well as the Election Act. Of course, only one penalty can be levied, only one charge can be prosecuted, but now we’re going to have two offences where there was only one previously.", "Is that going to help anything? I’m pretty confident in saying no. I have no idea why you would have wanted to make an offence under the Election Act also an offence under the Education Act when only one offence can be prosecuted anyway.", "There’s another one that I found quite interesting—and it will take a moment to explain—and that is access to multi-unit residential buildings. At the present time, owners and operators of multi-unit residential buildings must provide political candidates access to those buildings. If you think of it down here in the big city, the concierge would not be able to prevent a candidate from coming in and canvassing in a building. That works fine for examples like that. It would be an offence if that concierge prevented a candidate.", "This bill changes the language of this clause. Now it becomes an administrative, monetary penalty. It’s no longer a provincial offence. But it goes even further. Let’s say a candidate goes to a multi-unit residential building that doesn’t have a concierge service, that is locked, and the only people who can get in are the residents. If the candidate puts in a notice that he or she wants access to that building, if it’s not granted within 24 hours, it’s an administrative, monetary penalty to the building owner.", "The building owner may not even have 24-hour staff, may not have staff there at the building at any time. But just by posting a notice, a piece of paper with a piece of Scotch tape on it, if it’s not acted upon within 24 hours, the building owner is fined. They’re not even permitted the opportunity to defend themselves against the fine. His or her only appeal mechanism is to appeal back to the very agency that fined them in the first place.", "Why are we changing this to an administrative, monetary penalty? Are we seeing great hordes of building owners preventing candidates from having access to their buildings? I could tell you, in my research nobody has ever been charged under that, that I could find. There may have been somebody sometime, somewhere, but it doesn’t appear that there’s a great offence happening. But now we’re going to make it an administrative, monetary penalty, and no right to defend yourself against that penalty.", "I believe the standard penalty, if it’s not prescribed under the Election Act, is $5,000 or $10,000. It’s not small. You can imagine some small landlord with three or four or five or six units, who’s hardly making his mortgage payments and his hydro payments and his tax payments, now forced to pay a $5,000 or $10,000 administrative penalty because he wasn’t at the building every day looking for a notice to be posted on the door—foolishness.", "I spoke earlier about the northern boundary commission. This one was an odd one, Speaker—and maybe somebody over there will address these elements in the questions or comments, but it’s highly unlikely. I know Sudoku and crossword puzzles are much more entertaining than debate. Regardless, the northern boundary commission is tasked only with looking at the boundaries of Timmins–James Bay and with Kenora–Rainy River. Of course, as I said in questions and comments, there are 11 ridings in the north.", "We also know—just for people listening, who may not be aware—that for a couple of decades now this province has recognized the benefit and the value in having our electoral boundaries consistent with the federal boundaries. It makes it easier for people to understand who their member of the provincial Legislature is, who their member of the federal House of Commons is. It provides some symmetry that their member of the provincial Legislature represents the same area as their member for the House of Commons. That’s altered in a very minor way at the present time. We have one extra riding in the north—Mr. Vanthof represents the extra riding, I believe—as compared with the federal government. But now we’re going to have this boundary commission, made up of five people who will study the need to turn those two ridings either into three or into four.", "I think everybody will recognize this: Those two ridings, Kenora–Rainy River and Timmins–James Bay, are very large geographical ridings but have a very small population base. They nowhere near meet the baseline of population for other ridings. In Ontario, our baseline—what we are looking to achieve across all our ridings—is, on average, about 100,000 residents in each constituency, in each electoral district. I believe Kenora–Rainy River and Timmins–James Bay have about 60,000 residents in those two communities as it is, so to break them down into even smaller constituent elements really skews that standard.", "I think everybody knows this, but I’ll emphasize it: We know that we want every vote cast to be of the same value, the same weight, so that a vote in Toronto is no more or no less than a vote in Lanark; that a vote in Timmins–James Bay is no more or less than a vote in Chatham. But now, under this proposal, if we break this down into four ridings, the votes in the north in those cases will be substantially greater. I would go along with that, Speaker. I could understand some motivation if the government provided some. Have we seen any evidence, have we seen any rationale, have we seen any studies by this Liberal government about why these two particular ridings ought to be broken down into smaller? I haven’t. I have not seen anything. No studies; no analysis; no evaluation.", "Let me take you back to those fabulous mandate letters at the start of this session and the mandate letters back in 2014, where the Premier included in the mandate letters that their decisions will be based on science and evidence. Well, there you go. Maybe the member from Sault Ste. Marie will provide us that science and evidence today, because I know that he takes his mandate letters very seriously and would not think of advancing or supporting any bill that wasn’t based on science and evidence. So let’s see it. In questions and comments, let’s bring it out. Let us see the science and evidence behind that.", "I also want to go back to the hooey and the poppycock about improving voter turnout that was mentioned so often. Again, I like to base things on science and evidence: look at what studies are available; ponder, question and reflect on how we can make things better. I would like to see greater voter turnout. Without a doubt, I’d love to see a 70%, 80%, 90% voter turnout. It would be great. That would tell me that the people in this province respect what we’re doing here. When I see large voter turnouts, that tells me people are looking to their elected representatives to provide value in their lives, provide value in this Legislature. When we’re down at 50%—or, in the 2011 election, I believe, we went below 50% for the very first time in a general election: 49%.", "Speaker, there’s a group, and maybe the Liberals could take a look at this. It’s a group called Samara. Samara is a not-for-profit think tank, a group that studies democracy. They’ve made presentations here in the Ontario Legislative Assembly, at the Legislative Assembly committee, on electronic petitions. They have published a number of books. One that I found very interesting was called Tragedy in the Commons. They have studied low voter turnout. I can tell you with absolute certainty, Speaker, that not one of these amendments in Bill 45 was indicated in their books or their studies as a way to improve voter turnout. Not one. Voting machines don’t come into the Samara analysis of improving voter turnout. Changing the general elections from October to June isn’t indicated in Samara—not at all. And, lo and behold, not one clause in Bill 45 shows up in any document anywhere that I’ve been able to find as a way or a means to improve voter turnout. So I guess that’s why I came to that conclusion about hooey and poppycock with the minister’s debate on Bill 45.", "Speaker, hopefully we will support this bill. I would like to support this bill, but I would like to have a commitment from this government that the concerns that are raised by us—the concerns about the administrative monetary penalties, about the blackout periods, about the double offence on polling stations—are actually addressed during committee and, unlike in Bill 45, where not one Liberal member said one word during our committee hearings last week, that they actually engage in democracy; that like the youth, they come out and be participatory during committee hearings on Bill 2; that they find their voice.", "Listen, Speaker, if I am wrong in my assertions, I’ll be happy to withdraw. If they can demonstrate that there is value in giving the Liberal government advantages during by-elections and allowing them to advertise before anybody else, I’ll be happy to withdraw these concerns. But as I see it right at the present time, without a doubt some of these clauses in Bill 45 will have to be withdrawn, amended. I’m not going to sit back and quietly allow the Liberal government advantages on advertising during by-elections—absolutely not. I’m not going to sit back and allow unsuspecting, unknowing landlords and building owners to be fined $5,000 because they keep their buildings locked. I’m not going to just accept that.", "I do want to see, Speaker, the analysis and the benefits of this northern boundary commission. I think that’s appropriate. I think it’s worthwhile. I think it’s beneficial that the government share their evaluation with us.", "Oh, here’s another one. I don’t know how I missed this one. Here’s another big bonus that is going to drive our youth out to the polling stations. We are going to consolidate all of the C-1 candidate registration nomination papers. Everybody has been waiting for that one for ages. I get calls from my constituents all the time: “When are you going to consolidate the C-1 registration papers?”", "Of course, I should also say that there is a negative with consolidating those papers. At the present time, there are three forms that a nomination contestant needs to fill out to meet all the requirements of Elections Ontario. We’ve all done it. You have to get—I don’t know; is it 20 or 100 names from people in your riding who nominate you? There’s a bunch of different forms that have to be done. But now all the forms will be condensed into one, which means you can’t actually start being a contestant, you can’t open up a bank account, you can’t collect money, you can’t do anything until you get all your paperwork done—all your paperwork. Heaven forbid that we would want to have somebody engaged in the political process who hasn’t got all the paperwork done all at once, all in one form. My, my, my." ],

What they’d really like to see, I think—and the Liberals are promoting Bill 45 as one that would make it easier to vote and engage more people in the democratic process, especially our youth. A lot of these are technical things. They’re niceties, but are they the things where people are coming to your door or my door saying that these are the issues? What I hear about from people at election time, particularly during the election period and very quickly after the election period, is voter lists. “Do something tangible.” I don’t see anything in this bill about improving the voter lists.", "The other thing I hear a lot in our communities is about people who travel a long distance. They’ve been going to the same poll for 20 years and this time, in the last election, they had to go to the other end of my riding to vote; one spouse went to one and one went to another, although they live in the same house. So those types of tangible things.", "What I’ve had people suggest to me is that they want to see improvements to the voter list so they actually know they can vote in a timely manner, in an efficient manner and a convenient manner to them; and their location.

I support some things, particularly what the electoral officer has recommended in many cases.

There was a lot of voter fatigue, and I think part of it was because they became cynical. They felt that the system just wasn’t working for them anymore, so they stopped coming out as much.", "During my debate, I voiced concerns over the fact that provincial elections are seeing a significant decline in voter participation. Specifically, I mentioned that voter turnout has been falling steadily. Ontario used to enjoy a 65% voter turnout, but by the 2003 election there was a 57% turnout; in 2007, a 52% turnout; and in the 2011 election, a 48% turnout. The 2014 election saw a record high number of spoiled ballots: 31,399 Ontarians declined their votes in the last election, the highest rejection level since 1975. The largest protest votes hit the ridings of Brant, Etobicoke Centre, Kitchener–Waterloo, London West, Mississauga–Erindale, Oak Ridges–Markham, Ottawa South, St. Catharines, Windsor West and Thunder Bay–Atikokan.", "Likewise in the last provincial election, only 34% of youth cast a ballot. Obviously that’s something we want to address. I have no issue at all with the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Essensa, suggesting that there be voter registration now so that they’re ready for the election. That, hopefully, will help engage those youth.

Why is engaging voters becoming a bigger challenge? Our provincial Chief Electoral Officer, Greg Essensa, has aptly captured the trends in voter apathy. It’s money and special interests, Mr. Speaker, and those two come back to trust and integrity. Does the voter truly think that the government is here to do what’s in the best interests of them, or is it a self-serving government who, no matter what I do, they’re going to go down the path and do what they think is best to keep them in power?", "Many people suggest to me that there’s too much money in politics and voters don’t approve of money buying special favours for special interests. “The financial support that all Ontario political parties received in contributions from 2012 to 2014, which was one electoral cycle, was about $98 million,” according to Mr. Essensa. “This includes corporate and union contributions that amounted to about $50 million, or about 50% of all contributions.”", "Mr. Essensa made it his priority to recommend changes to the government on how to change “election laws so that elections can be administered in ways that are responsive to the needs of the citizens and to their local communities” and with an intent to increase voter participation. He suggested that “rules should balance between freedom of speech and electoral quality.” He appealed to the government three times to call for changes, and each time shared with them new concerns over the lax rules.", "“In the 2007 general election, there were 20 registered third parties, and they collectively spent $1.85 million.... There were three third parties that spent between $100,000 and $1 million, and there was one third party that spent over $1 million—it spent $1.08 million.", "“In the 2011 general election, there were 22 registered third parties, and they collectively spent $6.08 million. Of note, the collective advertising spending of third parties amounted to 14% of all election spending at this general election.

Rather than engaging people, people were actually saying, “Do you know what? Those groups can buy the election. My vote doesn’t count. I’m not going to drive—particularly when I have to drive 20 miles to get to a voting booth when there is one half a mile away from my house. I’m just not going to do it because there’s too much influence. They’re buying the election. There’s too much third-party involvement.” So I brought that to try to change it so that democracy was protected and it was actually back to the principle of democracy: that everybody should have a vote and should feel that their vote truly does count.", "Looking back over the last nine years, these figures show that third-party advertising played a significant and growing role in Ontario elections. We’ve reached a point where we are seeing third parties outspend political parties in our provincial election. I spoke at length with Mr. Essensa, the Chief Electoral Officer, about this as I developed my third-party bill, to ensure that it was engaging and that it was representative of what his concerns were and, most importantly, what the people of Ontario were telling me. Mr. Essensa concluded that the lack of spending limits and regulations “undermines confidence in the electoral process.” I believe that has more impact on people not coming out to vote than many of the things that are in this current bill, Bill 45.", "This is why it’s so frustrating to watch them ignore efforts to fix political spending rules and vote down bill after bill, including my PMB in October 2015. Every single member of the Liberal government voted against my PMB. They voted against my colleague Mr. Nicholls from Chatham–Kent–Essex, and they voted, Mr. Speaker, against your bill, in 2011, of a very similar nature—to limit third-party influence and to ensure that actual politics was about the people, not about a political party.", "Mr. Speaker, it saddens me, but I do hear this again on the street from a lot of people: “They didn’t want to do anything to fix it until they got caught.” We’ve talked about this in the House: buying access to cabinet ministers. The media jumped on it. The people of Ontario started to pay more attention to it. Then, all of a sudden—remember, in October, they voted unanimously against my bill to make any change, not one single change, to that act. But now they’ve come in and done a full-scale change of it. Then they brought in this bill, suggesting that this is going to solve all the ills and that voter engagement is just going to turn around tomorrow because of this bill. The Liberals are now talking about changing the rules because they got caught holding intimate backroom fundraisers with the very stakeholders who were lobbying them for government contracts and policy decisions. I don’t think even most of the members over there can refute that. I think they actually now will be able to at least acknowledge that some of that was going on. The numbers are out there. The facts are there. Obviously, they’ve had something happen because they brought in election advertising spending changes. So they have obviously come to the conclusion, “Uh-oh. We’d better change public perception here because, yes, there is an election coming in 2018.”", "At the end of the day, what we want, what the people of Ontario want, is a fair, more representative Parliament, and we want fair, more representative policies.

They might be more engaged to actually vote if they knew there was something tangible coming from the government.", "—support for 500 autistic people who require 24-hour-a-day care for one year. Those people might be actually encouraged to come out and vote if they thought that was going to be a difference.", "—eight thousand new affordable housing units in Ontario. Those people I definitely think would come to the voting poll to mark their X if they felt the government was doing things that were going to actually improve their life.", "—one year of home care for 55,000 people—55,000 people. Just think of that. If 55,000 more people came to the voting polls, that would be a good increase. This bill would have done its job.", "And they might match 35,000 Ontarians with a palliative care bed.", "All of those types of things are what I believe the public wants to hear, they want to see in legislation, they want to see in budgets. They want to see that the government is actually in tune with what their needs are. The Liberals essentially could pay for at least half of the litany of promises made during every election when they were shopping for votes.", "The other concern that I want to talk about involves efforts to move election data and information online. The government wants to remove the requirement to put advance poll information in print and move it to electronic posts. That’s a great thing for anybody who is within the electronic age, who has access, for whom that’s the way they communicate. But certainly, in a riding like Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, there are a lot of people who still can’t, even if they wish to do that. It won’t work in many parts of rural Ontario because we all have pockets that still have no Internet and in some cases no cellphone signal. That electronic world works really great in the urban areas; certainly in many parts of my riding it does. But there are lots of places—and I think we have to always think about every person and their ability to be engaged in the democratic process.", "Rural Ontario is still a patchwork, with some areas well-served by small, independent telecom companies, while other areas have little or zero access. The government has just now come on board to realize that it needs to help extend high-speed Internet access to rural southwestern Ontario. Some members over there always accuse me that I never give them credit for anything. Well, Mr. Speaker, they’re late to the party. If they hadn’t squandered those billions of dollars, we might already have it in every community in Ontario, which, again, would help engage people and get them out to the voter polls. But the good news is the formation of the SouthWestern Integrated Fiber Technology group—SWIFT, as it’s better known—who will now work to extend high-speed access to more than three million people in 350 communities over the next five years.", "This is going to be a great thing. I do applaud the government. I just wish—if they hadn’t had all the waste in my five years and the eight years before that, we’d already have it. And you know what? We’d already have more hospitals. We wouldn’t be closing 600 schools across the province—" ],

This model was tested during the Whitby–Oshawa by-election, where a scanning machine was used to electronically check off names from the voting list. Mr. Essensa, our Chief Electoral Officer, called the pilot results “an overwhelming success.” He also said an electronic voting system would cost more money in the short term, but it is expected to reduce the costs of elections in the future, because it would use fewer people to staff.", "He came in and did a briefing with our caucus—I trust he’s done it with all three parties—sharing some of the challenges that they’re encountering. I know in my riding it’s tougher and tougher to get enough people out on election day to be able to staff it. If there are improvements we can make there, and if electronic tabulation can help, it certainly is something that I would be supportive of.", "I do think we have to be cognizant. There are a lot of people who still—it’s going to take some time. They’re used to that paper ballot. As long as we’re maintaining that, then I think that’s fine. I mentioned earlier my colleague from Perth–Wellington. When he was a municipal councillor, you still used your paper ballot, you inserted it in the tabulation and that whole process was refined.", "There are concerns about people being able to hack systems. My understanding is it won’t be on a network, so it would be down to each polling station that would actually have that. So it minimizes risk, but people, again, are cynical. They’re concerned that someone could actually tamper with the tabulation process. I think it’s the Chief Electoral Officer’s responsibility to use prime examples, to use science to show that those are all legitimate systems.", "My understanding is the new system would cost about $40 million to implement and would include e-poll books, which would allow for ballot papers to be issued within about one minute of arriving at the polling station. I do recall him in his brief to us saying many people get frustrated. They come in, the paperwork is not correct, it’s all over the place, there are a number of stations, and they just get frustrated and walk out of the place. If that can happen in a minute, then I think that lessens the concern people would have, and hopefully they will come out, they’ll exercise the right and they’ll be there.", "Vote tabulators, which would allow vote results to be available within a half hour of polls closing: Again, I’ve heard good examples from my colleagues that these can work. It does speed up the system. We’re not waiting hours and hours for those results. There is an impact certainly from that perspective. As long as we have integrity in the system, it’s sound and people can feel comfortable, then I think that’s something we can support. It’s my understanding that it will take about two years to implement the changes.", "Mr. Essensa did say the status quo is unmanageable. I think he’s getting back to human resources. The ability to recruit and attract more people to staff is challenging in big rural ridings like mine and many of my colleagues’ in rural Ontario, and northern Ontario becomes even more challenging.", "Elections Ontario hired 76,000 poll officials for the 2014 election. We need about 100,000 for the election planned for June 2018, because the number of ridings will increase and because of population growth. We already know he’s addressed that there are challenges recruiting enough people now, and we’re going to actually add a significant number, Mr. Speaker; probably 25% more people are needed.", "Hopefully these suggestions he’s making are good, and to my thought processes we will support those ones that we believe are good and are actually going to effect some change.", "Jurisdictions that have moved to electronic vote tabulators have experienced challenges, most notably New Brunswick. Similar to the SAMS problems—and I’ve referenced these in the House a couple of times—this voting software was an off-the-shelf computer program that had glitches, and ground that province’s election to a halt.", "Similarly, we just had the EQAO hacked. We spent millions of dollars—a lot of people, with absolutely no value to that. People, frankly, are bringing those same types of situations to my attention, saying, “Could the same thing happen?” They’re just inquisitive, Mr. Speaker. They want to know, when they go up to something as important as the fundamental process of our democratic process—marking their ballots, marking the X and ensuring that the representatives that are duly elected are in office—they want to make sure that the systems are sound, that they’re there and that there’s no ability for anybody to tamper and have any control over those.", "There were comments in that New Brunswick election. Comments like “Call me old fashioned, but I think there is something to be said of counting votes one by one, making it a human enterprise rather than something at the whim of a computer system” were not uncommon following the breakdown of the New Brunswick vote tabulation.", "There are people out there who are cynical, who have valid questions, and I think we have to make sure that we can prove to them that the system is robust and that it has integrity.", "Because that experience has shaken many people’s belief in counting machines, the government would be wise to ensure that they don’t rush, that they don’t slam things through like they have in the past with many of the bills that, sadly, have been in this House.", "I’m going to go back and talk a little bit as well—I see my colleague from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington went through the bill, as he always does, very thoroughly. We struggle with some of the things that they’re suggesting there because are they really going to drive more people to come out to vote? It’s what I was trying to talk about in my earlier remarks. It’s about trust, it’s about integrity, it’s about people having the faith that they’re participating in a democratic process that truly is there to serve them. They want to see the government, regardless of political stripe or colour, serving their interests and needs.", "I haven’t seen anything in this bill address the voter list. That’s the biggest issue I hear about: the actual location of where they have to go to vote. I don’t see anything in here that truly is going to have a tangible impact to improve that process.", "Some of the other things, as I say, we’ll support—certainly anything that’s going to speed up the process when you get to the voter booth, if they can reduce errors. There are things in there like giving you a permanent ID number. Certainly that’s something that we can support. If we can speed up the process of tabulation and give people a comfort level—that it’s actually not going to be tampered with and that it’s legitimate—then I think we’re fine.", "I have addressed, in summary, the concern of reducing totally the ability to print ahead of time, to make sure we actually advertise pre-election, advance notice polls. In my riding, there was a huge uptake with regard to advance polls, and that’s to be accommodating to the people who are voting, which encourages, again, hopefully, increased voter turnout. I want to make sure that in areas where we don’t have 100% electronic capacity, you always retain the old form of print advertising.", "I’ve had a number of people come to me, saying, “Why can’t we take our schools? Why can’t we utilize one of the existing PD days”—not give another PD day—“where we have all those schools that are accessible, that have the electronic infrastructure, that have all the things we need?” In many of our cases, we have them in church basements. We have them wherever we can find them. But it becomes more daunting with the accessibility challenges—and frankly to have the true infrastructure to support. So that’s something that I think would be a good amendment to suggest here. Why wouldn’t they look at utilizing an existing asset that the people that we’re trying to engage actually pay for?", "Mr. Speaker, I’m all for improving and increasing voter turnout. Yesterday, I was at a very solemn ceremony, a very wonderful ceremony to recognize local veterans in my community. It’s always an honour and a privilege to go to those types of events and to say thank you, to truly look those veterans in the eye and say, “Thank you for giving me the ability to have peace, liberty and the ability to vote.” I’m totally in favour of anything that allows that, makes it easier, makes it more convenient and truly engages people to come out and exercise their democratic right.", "There are some good things in this bill.

The Chief Electoral Officer is required to create a provisional register of 16- and 17-year-olds who request that their names be added to the register. Speaker, I don’t know about you, but when I was 16 or 17, the last thing I was looking to do was register on some register I didn’t know about to vote. But you know what the best part about it is? It’s kind of ironic. The education department of this government is looking at eliminating the civics program in high schools. Isn’t that interesting? They want to engage youth to vote, but they’re going to cancel the program that tells them about municipal, provincial and federal governments. I can’t believe that they would do that. That’s what they’re looking at.", "Then it says down here that changes are to be made to the nomination and registration intervals, which permits the identification of electors who voted during the interval. That’s interesting because, speaking of nomination meetings, that party doesn’t even honour the person who wins. The Premier can take that person out and put another person in. They’re talking about democracy? They don’t even accept the person that people picked. That’s unbelievable. It’s almost laughable that they’re talking about democracy over there.", "“Information that is currently required to be provided to candidates”—information to the candidates and the people.

I think engaging the next generation of young people is important not just in the years to come, so that we have that group of young voters engaged, but for the future, to ensure that they vote at a young age, start at a young age and continue to be engaged in the years to come, so they continue to be engaged as citizens and continue to hold their elected officials and governments to account so we build the best possible province and best possible country we can.", "In my riding of Etobicoke Centre, what I’ve done is started something called a youth advisory group, where every quarter I meet with young people from across the riding. Everyone is invited to join and talk about the issues that are of concern to them. This is a way of making sure that I’m doing my job as an MPP and hearing their concerns and bringing those concerns to government and advocating effectively on their behalf, but it’s also an opportunity for them to learn about government and how they can engage effectively.", "In this bill, there’s a number of things that I think are positive. I think voter registration at an early stage just makes sense. Why not register young people earlier? By registering them, Elections Ontario can communicate with them and can ensure that they are on the list. They’re more likely to vote. That’s a no-regret move. I don’t understand why the opposition is opposed to that.", "The second thing is that I think this idea of making sure that people have greater access to condominiums and apartments is important, because making sure that canvassers can access condominium and apartments, where in some constituencies a lot of young people live, is just going to increase the turnout from people all ages, but particularly young people.", "Speaker, at the end of the day, the best way to engage young people is to deliver good government and to serve the young people well.

I’ve seen to that and we spent a lot of time and a lot of money—a lot of taxpayers’ money—improving those lists. They would go back to Elections Ontario, and invariably, when the lists came back again for the next by-election or the next election, the names that we had spent all that time and all that money removing were back on there again.", "So it’s not as simple as what people are saying about removing lists and fixing it. If there is any way of doing that, I would like to know, because I think most people who are talking about it have got no idea what they are talking about. I know the amount of effort that I spent and my staff at the time did, trying to remove names from lists. It’s next to impossible, because there are always concerns about nefarious activities and somebody trying to take somebody off that shouldn’t be. There are security and privacy concerns about ex-spouses maybe finding someone. So it’s not simple, it’s not easy, but I certainly applaud it.", "The ideas about maybe voting in schools, because they do have access to most of the communities: I certainly applaud that. I understand the concerns about safety with outsiders in those schools so I think it should be done on a day when the school is closed, whether it’s for a PD day or whatever. It would certainly make sense, because they do have Internet access, there is parking and they’re accessible.

We’re not opposed; absolutely not. The more representation that can be made in parts of the north, the better. It doesn’t really fit with the rest of the bill, and that’s a bit odd.

The Wahnapitae First Nation is 100 people on a square mile.", "The last time the electoral boundaries came up was last year about this time, Bill 115, where the provincial government passed legislation so the southern boundaries in southern Ontario would mirror the federal boundaries once again and so we would create more ridings in southern Ontario. At that point, we brought up the Wahnapitae First Nation, that while we were changing boundaries—both the member from Nickel Belt and myself had identified this as an issue. But more importantly, the Wahnapitae First Nation themselves had requested this repeatedly, verbally, with letters, and over multiple years. We thought, “Okay, we’re talking about boundaries; this is the time to do it.” We brought it up at the committee and we made a very strong argument. The government voted that amendment down. As a result, the NDP voted against Bill 115 for that single reason.", "Speaker, I took from the Hansard some of the arguments from the government about it, and the interesting one was from a committee member at the time—she’s identified here as Mrs. Kathryn McGarry. I don’t know what her riding is; she’s now the Minister of Natural Resources." ],

This doesn’t mean that, moving forward, if this bill is to pass, we won’t find some of those groups and maybe put together more of a robust list of folks who want to look at changing their riding boundaries in the future and do it all en masse.”", "So we have Bill 45, which creates what she was talking about: an electoral boundaries commission for northern Ontario. Once again, we say, “There, we finally got a boundaries commission.” We can put this issue before that boundaries commission and they, once and for all, in consultation with the Wahnapitae First Nation, of course, because it’s their request—we can see if they could actually be moved into the riding of Nickel Belt, which they’re actually physically attached to. But we have our doubts that the government is going to listen.", "Why I say that is because, in my role as interim House leader, for this bill to come to the House at this point, we need a unanimous consent motion because there’s another bill being discussed about the same issues at the same time. So when this bill was brought forward to the House leaders—I talk about House leaders, like the rules of engagement. When the government brings it forward, they have a special request, and often in a kind of a trade we, the opposition parties, ask for something in return. Our only request for this bill to be brought forward was that the Wahnapitae First Nation be considered in this electoral boundary commission. And the answer, unfortunately, but not surprisingly, was no.", "So once again, we stand here looking at a bill, and in this bill it actually talks about changing boundaries for ridings in northern Ontario to, I think it’s fair to say, better represent our indigenous population, which is a good idea. But I’m shocked and we are shocked that this government doesn’t actually look and see that we have another problem here that’s been identified, and they look the other way.

It takes five hours to get to it.

Potential voters should have the opportunity to speak with canvassers at the door, and herein lies the issue in apartments and condominiums. If a canvasser is prevented from entering a multiple-residence building such as a condominium building during the designated times, they can give notice that access must be granted within 24 hours, or immediately if they’re asking for access on polling day. This notice can either be handed to the person who has denied their access or—and this is very important—posted where access is prevented.", "It has no doubt been the experience of many members in this chamber that, in fact, getting entry to an apartment building or a condominium—often, there’s a concierge there and the concierge has not been informed or is not aware of the provisions of the election rules and denies access. This change will put the concierge or the apartment or the condominium on notice that the canvasser has to be allowed in. Or, rather than actually giving oral notice to the concierge or whoever is not opening the door, if you will, a notice can be posted on the door to the condominium building or the apartment building. This will ensure access so that members of all political parties, be they Liberal, be they Conservative, be they NDP, be they Green Party, be they any other party, will have a fair opportunity to engage the residents of apartment buildings and condominiums.", "Now, what if access is still denied, notwithstanding that notice that you provided orally or notice that you’ve provided in writing? Well, if access is not granted, the canvasser can formally notify a returning officer of the situation. The returning officer can then impose an administrative penalty on the owner of the multiple-residence building where access was denied. In the case of a condominium, the penalty would apply to the condominium corporation.", "But I’m often asked, then, “Well, isn’t this having canvassers freely roaming the halls of a condo or an apartment building risky?” That is, they’re just giving notice that they want to be let in or providing a written notice that they wanted to be let in. Well, we do want to make sure that people living in condominiums and apartment buildings participate in the democratic process. We feel that the balance, the idea of hearing from the candidates and their campaign, is an important part of the process. If you take a riding like Willowdale or downtown towards the lake shore, the central area of Toronto, for instance, there are huge numbers of condominiums, huge numbers for voting. Some of these buildings in downtown Toronto are 50 or 60 storeys. I see there’s a building going up, I think, on Yonge and Bloor. It will be 80 storeys. The building across the street will be something of the same order. There are huge numbers of voters there. It’s the same situation in Willowdale.", "Notwithstanding that the campaigner, be he or she from whatever political party, now has access, there is no requirement, of course, that the apartment dweller or the condominium dweller, once they’re in the building, has any obligation to open the door if someone has knocked on the door or rung the doorbell. And if they do open the door and engage in conversation, they can terminate the conversation at any time, close the door at any time. They can tell the canvasser, “I don’t want to speak to you. I have no interest,” or whatever.", "Another question, then, is, what types of residences are considered multiple residences? That is, what is considered an apartment building and what is considered a condominium? Well, there are a couple of exceptions. These changes that I’ve just outlined with respect to condominiums and apartments will not apply to student residences or anywhere where the emotional or physical well-being of the residents could be harmed. Under the act, multiple-residence buildings will include the following: apartment buildings, condominiums and housing co-ops that contain seven or more self-contained units. So the magic number, the kick-in number—the trigger number, if you will—is seven, with the exception that homes where there might be cause for concern about the emotional or physical well-being of the dwellers do not have to grant access.", "This proposal goes on to give the Chief Electoral Officer the power to impose administrative penalties. I’ve talked a bit about that. The question is often asked, then: “Are we changing the mandate of Elections Ontario to an enforcement organization? Are we taking Elections Ontario and giving them an additional policing responsibility, an enforcement responsibility?” To that, I say that while the powers to impose the administrative penalties are new, they are in keeping with the agency’s mandate—this is very important—as a non-partisan election oversight organization. The oversight here that we’re talking about is to ensure candidates of all political parties fair access to constituents, to voters, and ensuring that voters have a fair and reasonable access or opportunity to engage with the various political candidates.", "An enormous amount of voter engagement takes place through the political process, and potential voters should always have every reasonable opportunity to speak with canvassers at the door.", "I also want to say a few words about some of the mechanics, some of the details, of the modernization of elections. We live in an age of ever-changing technology and, of course, the advantages that can be found there should be applied to the electoral process. The bill will allow for the use of certain voting technology in provincial elections, which will enable the Chief Electoral Officer to implement his proposed technology-enabled staffing model.", "Under the current system, finding a voter on a list and giving them their ballot is now done manually. What it requires is that a poll clerk and a deputy returning officer go through a process to establish that list. At the end of the day, the votes are also counted by hand. As a result, Elections Ontario requires a tremendous amount of staffing to conduct the election. I can tell you, Speaker, that in the 2014 election, for example, there were approximately 76,000 temporary staff required to conduct that election.", "But by introducing appropriate technology to replace both of these functions that I’ve just referenced, the Chief Electoral Officer estimates that Elections Ontario will be able to reduce its staffing requirements by 41%. That’s a huge decrease, and it’s a significant step in improving the efficiency of the elections process. There are also significant financial savings.", "This new staffing model and the process that was piloted recently in the Whitby–Oshawa by-election also provided for a more streamlined and positive experience for voters. That’s what we heard back from the voters as a result of that. A whopping 96% of voters who were polled after voting with the technology-enabled model thought that the process was “much easier with the new technology,” and 91% of the voters were supportive of the technology being used in future elections.", "Speaker, I want to share my time now with the Minister of Advanced Education and Skills Development." ],

It has been done in other provinces, and I think Ontario should, in fact, follow suit.", "But I was kind of taken aback when the member from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek was so dismissive of the notion that young people care about politics. I can tell you that certainly from my experience, young people are the most passionate and the most idealistic. They really have ideas to make this province better, and we should encourage that participation. In fact, I’m sure I speak for the official opposition too. I mean, they recently nominated a 19-year-old to run in this election. The notion that young people don’t care is simply a false notion.", "Indeed, young people have more at stake than those of us who, as Bill Clinton has said, have more days behind us than ahead of us. Young people are going to live on this planet longer than we are. That means decisions we make here in this House about the environment, about the economy, about pensions, about climate change and all of those issues actually mean a lot more to young people than they do to us, because we’re going to be gone when they are cleaning up after us.", "In fact, I do want to talk about the changes that we’re making to OSAP. These changes were inspired by young people. It was people from OUSA, the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance, who, through very, very hard and thorough work, came and approached us with an idea that would make OSAP simpler, more progressive and more generous.", "I am delighted to be inspired by, encouraged by and pushed and prodded by young people to make a student assistance system that works for them. As a result of this work by young people, we’re going to be making tuition free for families with an income of $50,000 or less. In fact, there will be support available up to a family income of $160,000 and more, if your family is large enough.", "Young people are making a difference.

When you vote, you’re helping to shape the future of this province. You’re helping to decide where the new schools and hospitals are going to be built, just like the people in my community, Kitchener Centre, in greater Waterloo region. When they voted, they decided on a government that, just in the past couple of weeks, introduced measures to renovate and to add additions to three schools in my region, and we are building a brand new one in Cambridge.", "You’re also deciding how your government is going to grow the economy and create jobs. In my region, in my community of Kitchener Centre, we’re seeing a tech explosion. People who are voting, who are choosing how to vote, are deciding which governments to come in with their different policies, like policies to grow the economy. In my region, for instance, people who voted for this government—this government invested in the Communitech Hub, which, since 2009, has launched 2,600 new tech companies. Each one has between three to five employees." ],

The figures are even more troubling for youth: Only 34% of youth bothered to cast a vote. These are very troubling numbers and we need to address this. It’s a challenge for us.", "We spoke about engagement earlier on. I told you that when I worked as a journalist, whether it was a federal election, a provincial or local election, I would always bring in the so-called experts. I called them “my usual suspects.” They were university professionals from Laurier and the University of Waterloo, and we would ask them, “Why are so few people interested in voting?” They had their theories and their suggestions on how to move forward.", "So we have introduced a bill that would, if passed, modernize the voting process to better engage people and make it easier for them to vote; and, specifically, we’re looking at, in Bill 45, reaching out to young people in the political process by getting them to register in advance.", "I know that when I go into high schools and I talk to young people about the political process, they may not be interested in politics or politicians but they’re interested in the issues. They want to talk about the environment or animal rights. I know when I did a bunch of high schools in June, they were all talking about Donald Trump, so maybe that’s a cautionary tale right there. However, if we can grab them at that age and get them to pre-register so that when they are ready to vote at age 18 and the voter card arrives for them in the mail, they will want to participate. They will feel engaged like they’re part of the process.", "We want to make it easier to find advance polls by standardizing locations and hours. We want to get election results out to you faster by using modern technology. It’s important to do that. Most of the proposals that we’re putting before you were suggested by the Ontario Chief Electoral Officer.", "Speaker, I want to leave you with one last comment. In my community, the St. John’s Kitchen—they’re also referred to as the soup kitchen in town—reached out me and said, “You know, we want to get the people who come to the kitchen every day”—and there are 350 people in need who go in there every day for a meal—“to vote but many of them do not have homes. They’re homeless people. They have a right to vote. What can we do to get them to vote?” And so I connected them with Elections Ontario, who came in and said, “We can set up a polling station here for the next election in 2018.” I’m thrilled to know that we are going to have a polling station there at the St. John’s soup kitchen where many people who are usually marginalized will have the opportunity to vote.", "This is the goal.

I was quite impressed by what he said about the Far North and the Far North Electoral Boundaries Commission and how necessary it is. That was a meaningful presentation that he gave to us. We tend not to think of it because most of us don’t go to the Far North and we just aren’t associated with the distances and troubles of people who are remote and far away, as an oversight. When they’re a small group like 100 people, they fall through the cracks of democracy in this case, so we need to remedy that. This commission will be a wonderful thing, and the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane expressed that very well.", "I heard talk of how important voting lists are, as we all know, and how often there are errors and mistakes and great omissions. We need to spend more time working on having correct voting lists because it’s very maddening for people who have the right to vote and show up and can’t vote because, for some reason, they’re not on the voting list.", "There was talk about multiple-residence buildings, apartment buildings that could be locked, how candidates have the right to go in, knock on doors and campaign, and how there would be an administrative monetary penalty for the owner of the building who didn’t unlock the door. It was expressed earlier today how this is very unfair because sometimes there is no building manager; there’s nobody there in smaller buildings. Although democracy needs to be served, and candidates need to be able to go in and knock on those doors, I don’t really think we should be fining people on election day for not complying with the law." ],

If you think about the decisions that are made in this Legislature, made by governments of every stripe, those decisions are going to impact the young people today more than they’re going to impact any other age cohort, because a lot of those decisions take time to take effect and, frankly, they’re going to live longer than the rest of us.

I meet with youth and I hear from them about the issues that are important to them, but it’s also an opportunity for them to learn about how government works and how they can engage and be more effective citizens. I’m a big believer that the more engaged our citizens are at all ages, the more effective government is. It’s doubly important that we engage our young people, not only because they’re not as engaged as some of the folks who are older cohorts, but also because if we engage them young, they’re more likely to be engaged in the future, and that will lead to better government and that will lead to better outcomes and a better Ontario and a better Canada.", "I can tell you that on this side of the House we have—this bill has some important things: the registration of young people and allowing people to access condominiums.

  "text" : [ "I had about 10 minutes on this bill yesterday that I kind of spent on pieces of the act. Over the last few weeks—well, I’d say over the last seven years—I have had numerous patients come into my office with issues around their health care, but it seems increasingly so. I’m now getting them coming into my office every week.", "I want to share a couple of emails from patients who have either been into my office or called my office. They want the legislators to know their health care stories, because they believe that if they don’t tell you their stories, nothing is ever going to change.", "I got this one email, on September 24, from a woman. It’s around our home care system and, frankly, the lack of home care that is available to both our seniors and patients coming out of the hospital. This woman says, “I had a bilateral mastectomy on ... June 13. I was to spend one night in the St. Catharines hospital, but because I had an arterial line put in, due to safety in case I had a heart attack or stroke during surgery I ended up staying two nights” in the hospital—not very long, actually, having had a bilateral mastectomy.", "“When home care came in before I left the hospital, the lady said I would have to go to the office to have my dressing changed. I was upset, but too tired and too sore to argue.", "“So on Friday morning I had to get up and go to the other side of the city. I was in so much pain, every bump, railway track almost killed me. Then I sat in the waiting room for ... 20 minutes” in a dressing clinic in Welland. “There were seniors hacking and coughing in the waiting room. After surgery, I was worried about C. difficile or MRSA.", "“The halls and the rooms were not clean. The floors were ... dirty. The rooms were messy. I honestly was worried about getting infection.” This was at a clinic, right? A clinic that is run by CarePartners, a for-profit provider that actually operates in 14 areas of the province.", "She says she was also upset because she had a male nurse who came in to change her dressing. “There were female nurses there. I think it was ... tactless. I had just had a mastectomy, very insecure about myself. A female nurse should handle these types of cases.” I’m assuming this woman is an older woman as well. “Each room did not have supplies” so they had to keep going in and out of the room looking for things.", "“I have severe osteoporosis, six herniated discs, one fractured disc. Fibromyalgia, MS, have had two heart attacks, two strokes, nine knee surgeries including knee replacements, both elbows done, three rotator cuffs and almost every other type of surgery. I have major chronic depression. I could write pages of health issues. I was so upset about having to try to get ready to go to have a dressing change. I called to speak to the lady who told me I could not have home care again, and told her I wanted home care” to come to my house, that “it was too much for me to go out. She said no,” I would have to speak to a “supervisor. My husband and I were on a three-way chat with the supervisor for ... 20-25 minutes discussing this issue as she did not want to” give me home care “either. I finally said I was going to call the MP or MPP and things changed.", "“Both men at the centre were nice”—the male nurses, she’s speaking about—“but it was very degrading to me.”", "“They did not have the proper tube bandage so they took a pair of disposable underwear and cut the crotch out and used that” for a dressing for her mastectomy.", "“If they cannot keep you in the hospital for proper post-surgery care” then at the very least “they should come to your house.”", "“Very upset with the service I received.... I have so many complaints about the centre”—the dressing centre—“and the staff. Management were not pleasant at all. I was ill going through breast cancer and a mastectomy and they are arguing with you. Very frustrating.... I am too stressed still to remember everything except the service was terrible.”", "We followed up with this woman after she sent the letter. She basically said that it was so difficult for her to focus after having that surgery, she was really put out mentally and physically by having to attend at a dressing the clinic on the other side of town so soon after her surgery. She was not placing any blame on the personal support workers or the health care workers, but on the bureaucracy of the LHIN and the CCAC. I want to thank her for actually bringing those concerns forward.", "Then I got a letter about a fellow by the name of Doug. He is a veteran serving in the Canadian military for 20 years. He had surgery on his right knee after it went septic in December. He was in the hospital in Welland for almost a month. He got out on January 23. He says a cement block was inserted and now his knee is giving out. He has been told that the knee replacement surgery is not going to happen until July.", "So I’m assuming we’re talking seven months that he’s having to wait to have his knee fixed. He probably already waited six months to have the first surgery, and now he’s being told that he has to wait seven months because they can’t get him in to do that surgery. He’s a veteran. He’s asking that, on behalf of himself and other veterans in the country, the surgery be undertaken sooner rather than later.", "Once again, here’s somebody who cannot access the appropriate health care that they need in a timely way. We believe, as New Democrats, that this is because of the funding cuts that have happened in our hospital system and in our health care system: the frozen budgets that have happened, budgets that haven’t looked after the rising inflation, haven’t looked after the increase in population, haven’t even taken into account our aging population, right? The government needs to do something about this. When people are actually coming to your office and writing you letters about their issues, we need to do something.", "I’ve got another one here. This is on long-term care. The member from London–Fanshawe has been talking about long-term care over the last few months here. This is actually about a man who is suffering from acute myeloid leukemia. His doctor says “his remaining time is measured in months.” The problem is, he lives in Welland and his wife is in a long-term-care bed in Niagara Falls because there are no long-term-care beds available in Welland for his wife to be transferred to. Because he’s having chemotherapy, he is too ill to actually make that drive every day from Welland to the Falls—it’s probably 20 minutes to 25 minutes—so now he can’t see his wife. These people have lived together for many, many years, and she has been in Niagara Falls since September. Now it is almost the middle of October and he is not able to see his wife. That’s because we have 1,400 people on the wait-list in Niagara for a long-term-care bed, part of those 30,000 people who are on wait-lists across the province because this government has not had a plan to develop any new beds.", "I think the last nursing home that was built in this province was probably in 2007 or 2008, around the time when a nursing home was built in my riding. That actually took nine years from the day it was announced to the day it was built. It was a nine-year period. That wasn’t adding any new beds; that was just putting back in place beds that had been cut when older nursing homes had closed in the Welland area.", "Those are my comments for the moment. Thank you for the opportunity to share some stories with the legislators on people in my riding." ],

We’re a few hours into the second reading debate of the Strengthening Quality and Accountability for Patients Act. This is a very comprehensive bill with a number of parts to it. In fact, there are 10 pieces of legislation that are included in the bill. I just want to go over them quickly with you.", "There’s the Health Sector Payment Transparency Act. This is going to make it mandatory for the medical industry—that includes pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers—to publicly report payments they make to health care professionals and organizations: doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses and medical staff. If they are getting a meal or a trip or research grants or fees to make a speech from a medical company, it’s going to be mandatory for that information to be posted publicly to a database so the public can see who is getting what.", "You might ask the question: How widespread is this practice today? Quite honestly, the answer is: We don’t know. But what we do know is that this practice has been going on for years, but because the medical industry has never had to report it, there’s no way for us to gauge the extent of the impact on our health care system. We want to bring transparency to our health care system and we want to ensure the public knows if their health care provider is getting freebies from a drug company. By the way, legislation like this has already been passed in France, Belgium, Denmark, Portugal, Slovakia and the US.", "The next piece to this is the Health Protection and Promotion Act.

For many years, I was in a medical centre attached to a hospital, working with a lot of specialists. It was a very medical office. I understand a little bit about what we’re trying to achieve in terms of improving our health care, but there are going to be some changes. We do want to make sure that we’re going to be educating and consulting with the public health units, family council associations and long-term-care associations to make sure that everybody is clear on what the new legislation is going to mean for their sector.", "The member opposite just mentioned legislation in terms of health care professionals, specifically doctors getting compensated by pharmaceutical companies. Nobody wants to think that their doctor is prescribing a medication or a treatment based on some kind of dinner or gift from a company. I’ve worked with medical professionals for three decades, and I can tell you, I can’t give even one example where I felt that that was the case.", "I think we do have to recognize, though, that our health care professionals spend a lot of time and their own money travelling to get to meetings so they can educate themselves on new treatments, on new medication. I think this government is going to have to have that discussion some day on whether they’re going to make it more complicated, more difficult and more expensive for doctors to be educated. It is the pharmacare that normally does the education. Then we are going to have to come up with another system, because we certainly don’t want our doctors to not be cutting-edge and not know about new studies, new treatments and new medications that are out there." ],

People are bumping across us at events and when we go shopping and telling us such stories. I was just the other day having a chat with somebody whose mother has been three years in an ALC unit at Timmins and District Hospital because she can’t get a long-term-care bed at one of the long-term-care institutions in Timmins. That’s just not acceptable: having to wait three years in an ALC, an alternate-level-of-care bed in a hospital, which is vastly more expensive than paying to put that same individual in a long-term-care system. From an economic point of view, it doesn’t make sense, but also from a programming point of view.", "I have a good friend of mine, Lucile Carrier, who is currently an ALC patient at the hospital. She has started to develop Alzheimer’s or some form of dementia. She’s been stuck almost about a year now in an ALC bed at Timmins and District Hospital. What has been frustrating is that the system and the CCAC and the LHIN, when it comes to assessing people, are moving people who are on the list directly from the community into the long-term-care bed and leaving those people who were unfortunate enough to end up in ALC beds there because they have a place to stay. But that’s not fair, because in Lucile’s case, she needs programming; she needs stimulation in order to be able to deal with her condition. She is still very conscious, very coherent of what is going on around her, but leave her in that place long enough, it’s not going to be good for her.", "Why are we not, instead, saying “first bed available”—because in Lucile’s case, I think she’s number one on the list to be transferred, or number two. Why don’t we transfer her into a long-term-care bed and then have somebody from the community replace her in the ALC bed? It shows to what degree we have a crisis in our system, and we need to respond to it." ],

To put that in everyday words, that means that where possible, we’re trying to open up information and make it accessible to the public. It was the taxpayer dollar that collected that information. It should be available to the public.", "Of course, with health care, our challenge usually is that a lot of the information we have is private. It’s about individuals and their health. You know that as a nurse, Speaker, that you can’t reveal that information. But in this very particular case, it isn’t information about patients; it’s information about doctors, and it’s information we don’t have. So the purpose of the legislation with respect to payments, meals, trips, meetings, events, that doctors receive from pharmaceutical companies—we don’t have that information. We’re perfectly willing to post it and make it public. First of all, we have to be able to collect it, because we simply don’t know the magnitude of those payments.

He went into the emergency department with pain in his toe. He already had an amputation done the year before. He was a diabetic. He went to the emergency department. He laid in the emergency for three days from Monday to Wednesday. He was supposed to have a surgical consult by an orthopedic surgeon. That consult never happened. He was transferred into a medical bed at the St. Catharines site. An infectious disease specialist walked by his room, saw his leg sitting elevated on a pillow, and went to the nurse and said, “What is the matter with that man? Why isn’t anybody looking at his leg?” She said, “What are you talking about?”", "It turns out the man had flesh-eating disease; he had necrotizing fasciitis. He ended up with a second above-the-knee amputation, because he lay in an emergency department for three days, where they’re not staffed to be looking after patients around the clock, 24 hours. If you’re in the emergency department, you’re supposed to be there looking after emergencies as they come through the door. They’re not staffed like they are on the units, for 24-hour care.", "This is one of the issues that are happening in our system. Because of understaffing and underfunding, people are losing limbs.", "There’s something wrong with this, Speaker.

This is an important piece of legislation; there’s no question about it. There are a number of aspects to it, and I want, in the brief time I have, to just speak about some of the key elements of the legislation.", "What we all understand in this Legislature is that the people of Ontario deserve health care they can rely on, health care they can trust. What we are very clear about is that transparency itself allows the public to have access to information in order to be engaged and to make informed choices about their health and the health of their families, which is critical on a day-to-day basis.", "Ensuring that there is transparency within Ontario’s publicly funded health system very much does increase public trust—there’s no question about that—as everyone really does deserve access to information that can support them in being confident that they are receiving the highest-quality health care. That is why our government is so strongly committed to strengthening transparency in health care in the province of Ontario.", "We are introducing this new legislation that, if passed, would make information on payments from the medical industry to health care professionals and organizations available to the public. We think that is absolutely crucial. It would require the medical industry to annually report payments that are submitted to health care professionals and organizations. As has been mentioned before, this would include paid meals, travel, research grants, and fees for services such as consultations or sponsored speaking engagements.", "If passed, this new legislation would allow for the payment information to be publicly posted on a database, which would give Ontarians insight into the extent of private sector funding in the health care system.", "We do not yet know, if you ask the question, what the extent is of this. We don’t yet know the extent of industry transfers of value to health care. But if passed, these changes would allow us to have a better understanding of these transfers of value. This would arm patients with the knowledge that they want and deserve, to make informed decisions about their own health care. It is very, very crucial that people have the right to do that.", "The province deserves openness. The people of Ontario deserve openness and accountability, and we are working to make that the norm. France, the United States, Belgium, Denmark, Portugal and Slovakia have all addressed these issues through legislation, so we are aligning ourselves with a growing movement. We are leaders nationwide, as it turns out, as we are the first jurisdiction in Canada to move forward on this.", "But we’re not going to stop there; we don’t think that’s nearly enough. If this bill is passed, it will not only increase transparency but will strengthen health system accountability and enhance the quality of care for patients. It would guarantee, for example, that all long-term-care-home operators are providing safe and quality care for residents. My mother was in long-term care for seven years. I was very closely attached, in touch, in communication on a daily basis with the long-term-care operators. They did a magnificent job with my mother, but there still were challenges to make sure that everything went forward the way that we wanted it to.", "We do need a stronger inspection program with more robust enforcement tools, including financial penalties and new provincial offences. That would give ambulances the ability to transfer patients to more appropriate care settings, such as mental health facilities, to best address their individual needs. It would reduce overcrowding in emergency departments and provide the best care for patients in the most appropriate settings when they call 911 for assistance. It would protect Ontarians in their day-to-day lives by regulating recreational water facilities like splash pads and wading pools, and personal service settings like barber shops and nail salons.", "The proposed changes under the Strengthening Quality and Accountability for Patients Act will roll out important initiatives that will help Ontario’s health care system to continue serving all Ontarians today and into the future.", "Just briefly back to the Long-Term Care Homes Act: The safety and the quality of life of Ontario’s 78,000 long-term-care residents remains one of our government’s top priorities. As I said, I referenced my own mother’s experience in long-term care. While we know that the vast majority of long-term-care homes are in compliance with provincial rules and regulations, those that have recurring issues certainly cannot be tolerated. These proposed changes would enhance our oversight system for long-term-care homes.", "With those words, I will now pass my time off to the member for Kitchener Centre." ],

These changes are also going to include personal service businesses like barber shops, nail salons and tattoo parlours. We need to better inspect these locations and ensure they are free from infections.

We know that the vast majority of long-term-care facilities are in compliance with provincial rules and regulations, but we would like to strengthen that. The legislation proposes new enforcement tools such as financial penalties and new provincial offences.", "The next point is the Retirement Homes Act. We know that Ontario has a very robust oversight system, and this is enforced by the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority. After recent consultations, we know that we can improve the system by strengthening oversight powers. We want to increase transparency, accountability and governance.", "The next item on the list is the Ambulance Act. We are proposing a change to the Ambulance Act to give paramedics increased flexibility so that they can deliver alternative care options on-scene to patients. This would allow them to avoid unnecessary visits to emergency departments. Currently, paramedics are bound by law to take patients only to hospitals, so if this legislation is passed, it’s going to help reduce overcrowding in ERs because paramedics would be able to redirect low-acuity patients who call 911 to non-hospital officials.", "I have had this conversation at length with a friend of mine, a family friend, who is a paramedic. They find it very frustrating that when they have a patient who might not necessarily need to go to an ER, this is where they are directed to go; this is where they have to go. They are looking forward to this particular change. They might be able to take them to a mental health facility or a home or a community care resource.", "Speaker, I’m working my way down the list here.

We want to modernize and ensure the safety and quality of these devices.", "With the Medical Radiation and Imaging Technology Act, 2017, we’re proposing changes to strengthen transparency and oversight of diagnostic medical sonographers.

It recognizes that other health care professionals, like nurse practitioners, for instance, can prescribe medications in Ontario. They’ve already been doing this. We need to make sure the legislation reflects what they are doing.", "Here is the last point: the Ontario Mental Health Foundation Act, 1990. The province is proposing to repeal the Ontario Mental Health Foundation Act. This decision is based on the results of the review that came to the conclusion that this work is currently being carried out by community-based organizations.", "Like I said, this is a very comprehensive bill. It’s going to update our delivery of the health care system in Ontario and it’s going to ensure greater transparency for patients in our province. We were guided by 43 different organizations and 60 individuals on shaping this piece of legislation.

But we do know that some pharmaceutical companies and some other companies who sell medical products make payments to doctors, to other health professionals, to promote their devices, their prescription drugs, or what have you, to encourage those health professionals to learn more about that product and to prescribe that product, or to direct a particular device being used. There’s nothing wrong with these companies promoting their products and providing education to doctors, to nurses, to other health care professionals, but it must be done in a transparent way. It must be done in a way where a patient will have the confidence that the doctor, the nurse, the health professional they’re interacting with, that what they’re doing is being done openly and transparently.", "With this act, requiring that the payments, the sessions, the training sessions, the training dinners or lunches—whatever the case might be—that these companies put on, they have to be reported, that people can see that these companies are doing and what the individual health practitioners are receiving. I think that’s a very important reform. I believe Ontario is leading the way in this. It’s going to make a meaningful impact in the way these companies operate, because I have confidence our health professionals are already acting in a way with extreme integrity.", "Another very important aspect of this bill is some of the changes to the long-term-care industry and ensuring that long-term-care-home operators are providing safe and quality care for residents, with a stronger inspection program, more robust enforcement and much stronger penalties for those few long-term-care operators that aren’t following the rules and the law.", "Madam Speaker, any of us—and probably most of us in this chamber—at one point or another have had a loved one in long-term care. The peace of mind that you need to have to know that your mother, your father, your grandparents, your great-aunt or -uncle are receiving the care that they should be getting, that they deserve to get—that it’s being paid for them to receive in a safe environment—is extremely important.", "I know that, day in and day out, across this province, long-term-care homes provide excellent care to patients, but there are some instances where there needs to be more enforcement and there need to be penalties for those who aren’t doing things the way they should. This act will strengthen that oversight system.", "Another aspect of this bill is changes to the Ambulance Act and giving more power to paramedics and EMTs to direct patients to where they should be going, depending on what their medical needs are. This will reduce overcrowding in emergency rooms and will ensure that patients get the type of care and attention that they need. A cut on your leg perhaps doesn’t necessitate a trip to the emergency room; it can be treated a different way. If there is some kind of a mental health crisis going on, again, it doesn’t necessarily need to be dealt with in one of our acute care emergency rooms. This will give that additional flexibility to EMTs and to the system to direct people to the care that they need when they need it and how they need it. That’s going to be good for all Ontarians.", "I could speak all morning to this, but I will pass the time on to the member from Davenport to make some further comments." ],

I know that getting reliable emergency services quickly isn’t just important; it can be a matter of life and death. That is why it is so important that our emergency health services are operating effectively and efficiently. The amendments to the Ambulance Act will allow us to effectively allocate our resources and also help patients by getting them the resources that they actually need.", "But first, a little background: Today in Ontario, there are approximately 8,788 paramedics and more than 1,730 ambulances and support vehicles. Last year they transported nearly one million patients, and that number is growing each and every year. We know that many of the 911 calls are not of life-threatening nature; in fact, some are individuals having a mental health crisis who need specialized supports in a welcoming environment; others are seniors who do not need medical transportation, but do need reassurances and support of a medical professional. Up until now, if a call was made to 911, those individuals would be transported to an emergency room no matter the issue.", "We believe that a more flexible way of managing our 911 system is putting patients first or utilizing our existing resources in the best way. The proposed changes to the Ambulance Act would allow our EMS workers to treat and release low-acuity patients who do not need additional medical care. It would also allow them to treat and refer patients to a health setting more appropriate than an emergency room. These are changes that will help reduce offload delays at our hospitals. This means ambulances will be able to spend more time available to respond to those calls where every second counts. These changes will also ensure our emergency departments and hospitals are not filled with individuals who could be receiving more timely care in a more appropriate setting.", "It is important to remember that emergency health services—911—will continue to provide immediate response to serious emergencies, and, in fact, this bill would enable ambulance and emergency rooms to be more available for serious cases.", "It is important that we pass this bill. It would give ambulances the ability to transport patients to more appropriate care settings, such as mental health facilities, to best address their individual needs. It would reduce overcrowding in emergency departments and provide the best care for patients in the most appropriate settings when they call 911 for assistance, including care for those in the most serious need.", "These are changes that just make sense. These are changes that will allow us to better allocate our resources so that we can continue to reduce wait times for emergency care. It will help patients by getting them the resources they need instead of bringing them somewhere they may not need to go.", "This is a fantastic piece of legislation. I commend the minister for his work on this piece of legislation and look forward to supporting it when it comes up for a vote in the House." ],

So I’ve seen the perspective of EMS, and I’ve seen the perspective of long-term care up close and personal. I think together in this chamber we all want to work towards a health care system that upholds the safety and quality for the residents in long-term care.", "I think the member from Kitchener Centre made an important point. She spoke about the breadth of consultation that has brought the legislation to this point. I would submit that that robust consultation needs to continue as we move through the stages, as you’re well familiar with, with this bill. That should include, as it has thus far, a continuum with the family councils of Ontario, with the public health units here in Ontario, and also with the long-term-care association so we can arrive at a point where we’re all comfortable with the direction that this legislation is taking. At the same time, the stakeholders, as we move to the committee structure, have an opportunity to continue to provide their voice on ways in which we can strengthen the legislation going forward.", "This is an omnibus bill, and I’ll be speaking in more detail about it for 20 minutes later." ],

But I have to address one of the things that the Liberals talked about when they were talking about health care.", "One of the biggest challenges that we have in health care isn’t the $50 billion that we’re spending on health care; it’s how we’re dividing the pie up. I’ve said this before in the House. What’s happening with that pie is, we’re giving it to the LHINs and they run their organization. CCACs have been brought in to the LHINs now, but it’s still there. They get their part of the pie, and then it goes to a private company called CarePartners.", "So now that pie has been divided three times, and do you know how much money has gone to health care? Anybody? I know you’re all listening to me; you’re not on your BlackBerrys. Do you know how much? Nothing has gone to front-line workers. That’s the issue.", "So then CarePartners now takes their profit. I think last year it was millions—$300 million. It was an incredible amount of money. Again, no money goes to front-line workers. We have a crisis in health care because we’re not publicly funding our health care. We’re not making sure our nurses are getting the tools they need to do their job, that they’re getting the resources they need in our hospitals.", "When people say to me, “Gates, you’re making this up”—I went to Antica last week with my family. It was my birthday. Nobody sang Happy Birthday to me; I was very disappointed. But at the end of the day, the waitress came to me. Her father is in the hospital. He’s sick; very sick. Do you know what they said to that woman? “There’s no place for him to go, but we might be able to get you into a place for $3,500 a month. Have you considered talking to your dad about selling his house to get long-term care in the province of Ontario?” This is a senior who has given his entire life to make my life better, and we’re telling him to sell his house." ],

It will help not just all the people in Ontario but the people in his riding of Thunder Bay–Superior North.", "He talked about the transparency that’s evident in some of the provisions of this bill. The most important part, of course, is about protecting the safety of residents in long-term-care homes. He mentioned his mother. I thought it was incredibly sweet for him to do that and to talk a bit about the experience she had in the home. What’s important to realize is that not all residents of long-term-care homes have a dutiful son who can look after them and work closely with them and the staff. We have to be sure that our system is accountable in a way that all residents—regardless of whether they have a son as competent as he is to assist—get the care, and that the transparency and accountability is there in the system.", "That’s why the Auditor General will have an opportunity now, if this legislation is passed, to do a value-for-money audit of all the long-term-care homes, which she currently cannot do. I think that’s an incredibly important part.", "Also, the member from Kitchener Centre and the Minister of Housing spoke. Most importantly, I liked the comment from the member from Davenport about how we are decentralizing care in this bill so that emergency workers have a chance to look after people on the street who don’t have huge injuries; they can patch up a bruise or a rash and then decentralize the care. Then they can go and not have to be tied up in waiting in emergency rooms, tying up staff and valuable resources. They’re actually out on the street, where they’re needed most." ],

I think that the public is getting a little tired of us having discussions about new rules, new regulations and new oversight when they feel that front-line health care is just suffering so much. We can’t just keep adding to the bureaucracy and not somehow look at ways to find more efficiencies.", "We heard from the Minister of Housing, I believe it was, who said that a cut on the leg doesn’t necessarily need an emergency room, and he’s absolutely right. It doesn’t need an emergency room. The public is asking for more clinics that are open evenings and weekends. They are asking for that. What are they seeing? Not far from my riding of Thornhill, we saw the urgent care centre at Branson close. We don’t see another urgent care centre being opened in that area. If there are problems with a property in one location, obviously, before we shut it down, we have to find a place to lease and ensure that the doctors and health care workers from that centre don’t just get dispersed. It’s so hard to put a team together, to get that up and going again.", "I hear from people who say that other provinces are funding new cancer treatments and cancer medications, and Ontario has fallen behind. Lymphoma Canada specifically is having a lobby day coming up in a couple of weeks. They’re very concerned about health care for their patients and their clients in Ontario.", "I think that overall there’s a lot more that needs to be done. And e-Health was a fiasco in this province.

Absolutely. We definitely need to engage all of our stakeholders to guarantee, for instance, that all long-term-care operators are providing safe and quality care for residents and that we do have a stronger inspection program with more robust enforcement tools, including financial penalties and new provincial offences.

  "speaker" : "Mr. Lorne Coe",
  "text" : [ "I rise this morning to speak to Bill 160, the Strengthening Quality and Accountability for Patients Act, 2017.", "If passed, Bill 160 would implement a number of significant changes within the health care system. For example, schedule 5 to the bill includes amendments to the Long-Term Care Homes Act, the Health Care Consent Act, the Substitute Decisions Act and the Personal Health Information Protection Act. These proposed measures are related to the use of restraints, inspections and penalties that include, among others, the following provisions.", "Inspectors would be able to issue penalties to force long-term-care homes into compliance with the act but would also have the power to reduce the penalty amount if it presented unnecessary hardship on the long-term-care home. On this aspect, I believe it’s important that the minister advise, as we move through the discussion of this legislation, how many additional inspectors will be needed in order to ensure that the requirements of this new framework are met.", "Furthermore, the ministry will also charge a fee for inspections for recurring non-compliance in long-term-care homes. What’s not clear, Speaker, is if the number of inspections will be capped at any point and instead be moved up to a licence suspension for non-compliance. We need greater clarity in that particular area.", "Inspectors will also be granted the ability to revoke or suspend licences and order an interim manager to step in to run a long-term-care home. Additionally, the ministry would have the ability to claw back funding or withhold funding from a long-term-care home under the new enforcement tools. This is to the point I made earlier in the response to the earlier comments about the need for greater consultation, over and above what has occurred thus far.", "Other proposed amendments in schedule 5 of Bill 160 include a change to allow the minister to suspend licences and issue orders. I would note here that due diligence cannot be used as a defence by a licensee, although they may appeal within 28 days of the order or notice. The minister may also issue additional policy and operational directives dealing with care levels, but not make them home-specific.", "In addition, the fees associated with penalties will be increasing under the proposed measures, with the first offence costing $100,000 or 12 months in jail and the second offence costing $200,000 or 12 months in jail. The proposed penalty rates are a substantial increase from the current penalties, which are $25,000 for first-time offenders and $50,000 for repeat offenders.", "Some of the other proposed measures in schedule 5 will be of particular interest to families, those people watching today who have a loved one with dementia. In particular, the bill would amend the law regarding secure units in Ontario’s long-term-care homes. Secure units are areas within a long-term-care home that are often used to keep people with dementia safe. These units will frequently have locked doors to prevent wandering and alarms on exit doors in case a resident leaves.", "To be clear, these are protective measures to ensure that those with dementia do not find themselves in a situation where they could potentially be injured. The sections of the Long-Term Care Homes Act dealing with secure units were previously drafted, but they were never brought into force, meaning that those sections in the Long-Term Care Homes Act are not currently law.", "To address this oversight, the bill before us today, Bill 160, and in particular schedule 5, proposes to address this gap by legislating what would be called “confinement” and outlining the qualifications for when this confinement would be applicable for a resident, and what restrictions would apply should a resident be confined.", "There are few situations in which the government permits people to be detained against their will, the most primary of which is imprisoning criminals. In order to ensure that senior citizens with dementia across Ontario are not subject to similar provisions, this gap in the legislative framework is rightly being addressed.", "The proposed legislation states that residents of long-term-care homes cannot be restrained or confined due to convenience or a disciplinary measure. Further, the bill introduces specific criteria that would have to be met in order to confine a resident. Consent would be required of the patient if they are mentally capable of making the decision. Otherwise a substitute decision-maker, usually a relative, would be responsible.", "If the substitute decision-maker consents to a resident being confined, the long-term-care home would have additional responsibilities to the resident, such as giving the resident written notice, verbally explaining a notice and providing an opportunity to meet a rights adviser.", "But there’s no clear definition of what a “rights adviser” is. Bill 160 offers no definition, so the bill only goes so far. The Retirement Homes Act states that it’s the person designated by, or in accordance with, the regulations as a rights adviser. However, there’s no mention of a rights adviser in the Retirement Homes Act’s current regulations. I think it’s clear, as a consequence, that this section of Bill 160 requires additional clarity and review.", "Should the resident choose to meet with the rights adviser as set out in the proposed bill, this adviser would have to tell the resident that he or she has a legal right to disagree with being confined and apply to the Consent and Capacity Board for a hearing. At that hearing, the resident could then appeal to the board for the right not to be confined. Interestingly, a substitute decision-maker would have to give or refuse consent to the confinement in accordance with the provincial rules that currently guide how substitute decision-makers must make treatment decisions. This means that it is possible a resident may at an earlier time have expressed a clear wish not to be confined in a long-term-care home, and a substitute decision-maker would be required to follow that wish.", "What is unique here is that a resident who has a prior capable wish to refuse a particular medical treatment runs the risk of harming themselves in the long term when a decision made at an earlier time must continue to be honoured. For example, a person may have a prior capable wish never to be treated with a blood transfusion, even if that is what is required to save their life years later.", "But here, Speaker, respecting a prior capable wish not to be confined in long-term care could introduce a risk of harm to others, as some people with dementia are not only confused but can also become aggressive. How these individuals will be treated could prove very difficult for families who want their loved ones in locked units due to legitimate safety concerns, including a risk of harm to other vulnerable residents in the long-term-care home.", "Fortunately, a substitute decision-maker would have the right to apply to the Consent and Capacity Board for a hearing for permission to deviate from the prior capable wish, and consent to confinement. Such permission from the Consent and Capacity Board might be granted if the Consent and Capacity Board is persuaded that the resident, if capable, would probably give consent because the likely result of the confinement is significantly better than would have been anticipated in comparable circumstances at the time the wish was expressed.", "While it’s logical to offer legal protections to persons being involuntarily detained, mirroring the legislation will likely introduce some practical issues, some of which I’ve raised already, and could put some long-term-care home residents at risk. Hopefully, the government will seek feedback from stakeholders to refine the bill and ensure that it strikes an appropriate balance of the liberties of residents alongside the protection of other, more vulnerable persons in the same long-term-care home.", "The Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus wants to see a long-term-care system that upholds safety and quality and one that is hailed as a success for all residents in long-term care. As builders of our communities, residents in Ontario’s long-term-care homes deserve no less. They deserve no less.", "The government must ensure that it allows for adequate time to educate the long-term-care sector about their new legal obligations, of which there are many, as opposed to simply applying charges, penalties or, even worse, treating them as though they are a cash cow.", "Meanwhile, through some of the amendments to the Ambulance Act set out in the proposed schedule 1 of Bill 160, the government is seeking to provide paramedics with increased flexibility to deliver alternate care options on-scene to patients. If these legislative amendments are adopted, paramedics will have the ability and the authority to refer patients to destinations other than hospitals, as is currently required by law. Under the proposed legislative regime, persons with mental health issues, for example, could be taken to a facility more appropriate than a hospital, such as a primary care or community-based health care facility. However, this proposed framework would require that these alternate facilities be able to operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week, similar to hospitals.", "I’d like to turn now, Speaker, to the proposed legislative measures in Bill 160 that purport to address transparency, freedom of information, and privacy.", "I want to be clear in discussing these aspects that the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party supports transparency and openness across the health care sector and, in fact, across all of government. Looking for ways to increase transparency and accountability for Ontario’s patients and their families is a goal we all strive for and want to accomplish.", "It’s crucial that the private information of patients is kept secure and not used beyond the purpose for which the information was collected and intended.", "With respect to schedule 4, the Health Sector Payment Transparency Act, there are aspects in this section which we support, in particular the requirement to report information about financial relationships that exist in Ontario’s health care system, including health care research and education, and to enable the collection, analysis and publication of that information in order to strengthen transparency and openness.", "Encompassed in the proposed schedule 4 of this bill are the reporting requirements of transfers of value paid to all regulated health care professionals and organizations. However, both the specific recipients and the threshold for reporting have been left to be determined by regulation. The proposed reporting requirements would be substantial, and to omit the specific details of the reporting requirements and the framework within Bill 160 is a significant oversight within this particular schedule. I would urge the government to look at that particular section again and I hope that we’ll see some amendments.", "Speaker, you will know that a national campaign called Open Pharma was launched in June 2017, calling on the federal government to mandate the public disclosure of all payments and transfers of value, such as gifts and meals, from pharmaceutical companies to physicians. In particular, the Open Pharma campaign called on the federal government to make drug companies more transparent by publicly disclosing clinical information on the safety and efficacy of drugs and medical devices, and making industry-funded research open access so that it’s available for re-analysis in academic journals and other platforms.", "In a recent Globe and Mail article, the federal health minister at the time, the Honourable Jane Philpott, said that any move to force the disclosure of payments to individual doctors should be left to the provinces to decide. It’s clear, Speaker, as you read the omnibus bill, Bill 160, that the proposed legislation in schedule 4 is the government’s response to that. But while on the one hand, the government has proposed greater levels of transparency in certain parts of the health care sector, they have also created an exemption from the application of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act in Bill 160. This exemption would apply to records in the custody or control of the Ontario Health Quality Council that were prepared or obtained by the Patient Ombudsman in the course of conducting an investigation within the meaning of section 13.3 of the Excellent Care for All Act, 2010.", "While the proposed measure in Bill 160 is designed to keep the information of patients private, as it should, in the event that the Patient Ombudsman must conduct an investigation, there is concern that the government will treat these legislative measures as a precedent to keep other less sensitive pieces of information out of the hands of the public in order to preclude scrutiny. This is clearly unacceptable and contrary to the broad intent and purpose of the legislation in terms of transparency and openness. The Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus will ensure that the government upholds its commitment to openness and transparency in the totality of Bill 160.", "Significant portions of this omnibus bill—it’s quite thick; it’s several hundred pages long—have been left to be determined by regulation, the timing of which is unknown and the content uncertain, very uncertain. The ability of MPPs in this chamber to determine law through regulations gives enormous power to the minster to enact the specific measures of Bill 160 when and how the government wishes.", "Ultimately, ministers of the crown should be tabling complete bills in the Legislature to give all members of this Legislature an opportunity to participate in rigorous debate regarding the impact of the proposed new measures and amendments to existing legislation, of which there are many in this omnibus bill. The notion that ministers can table a bill and then determine substantial, specific portions through regulations at a time most convenient to the government clearly does not give other members of the Legislature the opportunity to properly scrutinize the bill in its entirety, the entire context of it all.", "Speaker, it also suggests a hurried consultation pertaining to Bill 160. This legislation, as I have described earlier in my comments, will significantly alter the health and long-term-care sectors in Ontario for years to come. I believe it is incumbent on the government to conduct ongoing consultations with all sectors within the health care system impacted by this legislation, to ensure that the sector stakeholders continue to have an opportunity to have their voices heard. I would encourage the government to conduct this type of consultations with the people in groups impacted by these changes, in particular on educating the health and long-term sectors about their new legal obligation.", "Education is going to be crucial, as there are significant proposed measures in the legislation, including new enforcement tools, financial penalties and new provincial offences for non-compliance. The worst that can happen here, Speaker, is to rush through major changes, create a culture of fear, make the sector even more vulnerable and, as a result, have unintended consequences within the long-term-care sector and other aspects of the health system.", "In closing, Speaker, there are a variety of proposed measures included in Bill 160 that will benefit Ontario’s health and long-term-care sectors, but the government must put greater effort and thought into the design and consequences of legislation, particularly when they seek to include such a large number of legislative amendments in one bill. In closing, at the end of the day, we want to make the health care system more efficient and improve the health care experience and health outcomes for residents we have the privilege of representing. They deserve no less." ],

As of late September, we have provided more than $29 million in claims for replanting and losses due to insured perils, including wet weather.", "Let’s give Ontario farmers our support and thanks, not just today or this week, during Ontario Agriculture Week, but all year long.", "Before closing, I’d like to remind everyone that the Premier’s annual food drive kicked off earlier today, so look in your cupboards and take a trip to the grocery to make a contribution to your local food bank. Let’s all chip in to make this Thanksgiving memorable for everyone, and thank Ontario farmers for bringing us the bounty we enjoy with our families.", "Learn more of what is in season and check our great recipes at foodlandontario.ca. You can also show your support for our farmers by tweeting, using the hashtag #OntAgWeek in conjunction with #ontarioag.

I want to thank all of the teachers and education workers across the province for the important work that they do each and every day to support Ontario’s students.", "We have some of the best teachers and education workers in the world. I know that their hard work is helping our students succeed.", "Mr. Speaker, I have made it a priority to visit at least one school every week. Even today, I was at St. Bruno/St. Raymond. I have visited teachers and education workers in their classrooms, from Windsor to Thunder Bay to Ottawa and Cornwall, at over 70 schools across the province.", "On each of those visits, I saw remarkable educators who do so much each and every day in their work with children and youth in this province. Carrie Wilson, a teacher at Northeastern Elementary School in Sudbury, demonstrated a reading and spelling exercise with students in an integrated classroom designed to support students with learning disabilities.", "In Oakville, last spring, I visited St. Mary Catholic Elementary School, and I had the opportunity to meet Maureen Asselin and her students, who were learning math in a new way that the students were really engaged and excited about.", "On my visit to eastern Ontario, I saw how Mrs. Courte has inspired her students to be creative in their design of a mousetrap car at Collège catholique Mer Bleue.", "In Sault Ste. Marie, I visited the Urban Aboriginal School and saw how Kim Edmond encourages students in learning activities that reflect their culture and history.", "The outstanding work of teachers and education workers that I see during those school visits is also clear in our data. Earlier this year, I was proud to announce that our high school graduation rate increased to 86.5%. Mr. Speaker, this is the highest level in Ontario’s history. That means that more students than ever before are graduating from our publicly funded education system with the skills and knowledge that they need to reach their full potential.", "Since 2004, about 217,500 more students have graduated high school than would have if the graduation rates had remained at the 2004 level. That’s roughly equivalent to the populations of Kingston and Thunder Bay combined.", "Mr. Speaker, Ontario’s students continue to perform well locally and globally. In fact, 71% of elementary students are achieving our high provincial standards in literacy and numeracy. As part of the 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment, Ontario students performed at the Canadian average and above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average in mathematics, reading and science. In fact, no jurisdiction outperformed Ontario’s 15-year-olds in reading in the latest OECD assessment.", "We could not have achieved these results without the dedication of our teachers and education workers who work tirelessly to support all students. Their commitment, expertise and hard work continue to make Ontario’s publicly funded education system one of the best in the world.", "But, Mr. Speaker, supporting students is about more than graduation rates and PISA scores in math and reading. Ontario has one of the best publicly funded education systems in the world because we are committed to promoting well-being and equity.", "In order to better support teachers and education workers so that they can continue the outstanding work they are doing in classrooms, I recently visited a number of schools to announce our next steps.", "First, we are strengthening well-being supports for all students, educators and staff in order to make schools across the province more inclusive, safe and welcoming environments. Our $49-million, multi-year plan will focus on the cognitive, social, emotional and physical development of all students, along with their sense of self and spirit.", "One of the ways we can promote well-being is by making sure students have access to breakfast, because we know it is the most important meal of the day. When I recently visited St. Paul Catholic School in Toronto, I saw how the entire school community was working together to do that.", "Next, the Premier and I announced that we will begin a refresh of the Ontario curriculum from kindergarten to grade 12 using transferable skills like collaboration, creativity and citizenship as the foundation. As part of the refresh, we will also review student assessment and reporting with our education advisers and we’ll seek input from students, parents, educators and the public. These are important changes. We know we can only realize success with the engagement and input of teachers and education workers who will help shape this transformation.", "Finally, I unveiled Ontario’s Education Equity Action Plan. It is a three-year strategy aimed at identifying and eliminating discriminatory practices, systemic barriers and biases at all levels in our system in collaboration with our partners: teachers and education workers.", "Working together with the recently appointed equity secretariat, our education equity plan aims to enhance school and classroom practices, governance and human resource practices. We will overhaul data collection, integration and reporting, and advance leadership and organizational culture change within the Ministry of Education.", "We know these are bold changes and we will need the help of our partners to make them a reality. As I have said before, without partnership, professional collaboration and respect, we cannot make important advances toward the goals we all share. Our teachers and education workers are all working incredibly hard to create the best possible learning experience to position our students as the next generation of engaged and resilient citizens.", "I believe that by working together, we can do more to support student achievement, equity and well-being, and improve outcomes for all students in Ontario.", "As we celebrate World Teachers’ Day today, I want to once again say thank you to all the teachers and education workers across Ontario for your outstanding work. Thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your passion. Thank you for your dedication to ensuring that our students are successful and on a path to reaching their full potential. Happy World Teachers’ Day, and thank you for your ongoing commitment." ],

It’s a very, very complex business.", "Across the province, there is recognition of Ontario’s Agriculture Week. I’m especially pleased to report that it wraps up so much of Ontario’s fall fair season. We’re right in the middle of the Norfolk County Fair and Horse Show. Leading up to this Thanksgiving is the famous Burford fair—Speaker, both of us have attended that one—hard on the heels of the Caledonia Fair and so many, many other fairs that go back to springtime.", "Fairs aren’t just rides. I know there’s a ride I was looking at the other day at the Norfolk fair. It’s called Pharaoh’s Fury. Anyone I have talked to who has ridden on it with their kids gets sick to their stomach. Maybe it’s the candy floss.", "Fairs are so much more and have been so much more for well over 100 years as far as celebrating the bounty and the best that we can grow and produce, and breed with respect to livestock—again, an ongoing raising of awareness of agriculture.", "Again, building on the local plowing matches and the IPM we’ve all recently attended, and Canada’s Outdoor Farm Show, I should point out that Ontario Ag Week was the result of an MPP from this Legislature, Bert Johnson. It’s a great concept to encourage people to get involved and to realize where your next meal comes from and, in many ways, where the next meal comes from for the seven billion other people in the world who have mouths to feed.

Teaching Ontario’s next generation requires immense generosity, compassion and, of course, hard work. We see the evidence of that every day. For the thousands of teachers across Ontario, this is no small task.

It’s irrefutable that both teachers and education workers are the backbone of the education system in Ontario. Only with them can every student be granted the opportunity to achieve their best.", "Today, on World Teachers’ Day, I would encourage all Ontarians to consider the impact that teachers and education workers have on students’ learning and their future success.", "Thank you very much, Speaker, for the opportunity to honour our teachers and education workers in the province of Ontario." ],

Many of our professors and higher-learning educators are part-time and working in precarious placements. Why aren’t we ensuring they can teach in predictable, stable, full-time positions? It isn’t freeing or empowering to shortchange our educators in our post-secondary institutions. UNESCO has recognized that there are many conflicts that challenge the ability of teachers to do their jobs, including budgetary restrictions that affect many teachers in much of the world, undermining both their freedom and empowerment. I’d like to delve into that.", "I believe education is the great equalizer and should be funded fairly and equitably. It shouldn’t matter where you live or how much your parents make; every student deserves access to appropriate learning supports and resources and deserves to be safe and supported while they learn. Teachers and education staff deserve the same.", "We are not funding education fairly. Special-needs students are not appropriately supported. Our schools fundraise for tools and supports. Teachers often make up what difference they can. They pay for trips, snacks, art supplies, shoes and soccer balls. They teach in under-resourced classrooms and do their best every day.", "Speaker, some of my teacher friends wanted the government to think about a few things on this World Teachers’ Day. They wanted me to share that teachers don’t believe the government cares. While they are left to deal with so much challenge in the workplace, they don’t want hollow praise or words about gratefulness; they want you to fund education so that they can do the job they are supposed to be doing. They want you to fund education so that students can be successful and not go to school fearful or riddled with anxiety as they face the violence plaguing our classrooms. They don’t want their students afraid of being hit or hurt; they don’t want to be hit or hurt themselves. They want to be able to teach.", "On this year’s World Teachers’ Day, on behalf of Ontario’s New Democrats, I want to sincerely thank teachers for the invaluable work that they do every day. But more than that, New Democrats will always fight for strong public education. Educators shouldn’t have to wear bite-proof and bullet-proof Kevlar in classrooms. Teachers shouldn’t be fearful to go to work. Teachers should be respected and protected. They should be recognized as highly educated professionals with the capacity to change the world and inspire bright futures, instead of being forced to teach to standardized tests and checklists.", "Fairly fund education.

For most, I think the purpose of Agriculture Week is to help them stop and recognize the important role that the people who work in agriculture play in this province. There are over 700,000 people who work in that sector here, which is an incredible number. It’s one of the biggest drivers in the province.", "But for me, and I think for many of my NDP colleagues, Agriculture Week is about the cornerstone of the people in the sector, and that’s the farmers. For them, Agriculture Week likely will be about the weather because it’s been a really tough summer. Lots of times there have been tough summers, but this has been a really tough summer. Farmers always contend with that, but the last few weeks of our extended summer, while others were talking about the heat and complaining about heat, there was no farmer in Ontario complaining about the heat because those few weeks of extended heat for many people in the agriculture sector saved the summer. It’s incredible how big a difference those couple of weeks of heat made.", "Farmers are an incredible breed, and one I’d like to recognize. The OFA organized a tour of Beverly Greenhouses this summer. One of the owners, Dale VanderHout, gave us a tour. He was talking about a different management practice they’d implemented. He said, “You know what? The plants just seem happier.” That spoke to me because I’m a farmer. Farmers want their plants and their animals—they want everything to be happy because that’s how they make their living. That’s why they keep fighting with the weather and fighting with the elements.", "Lastly, I think we all need to thank the people who continuously do that. Rest assured, the farm families of Ontario will continue to work. They will work tirelessly until the crop is off so that we can all eat the great food that is grown in Ontario." ],

They learned that this was done in order to pay for the development and maintenance of another, much older life lease project nearby.", "This is the sort of blatant misuse of reserve funds and disrespect for life lease holders that I am aiming to prevent with the legislation I am proposing today.", "This bill will prohibit reserve funds from being used on any complex other than the one from which they are collected. It also requires that tenants be given ample notice of increases in their fees.", "When a roof begins to leak, when a sidewalk crumbles or when an elevator stops working, it goes without saying that money will be needed to pay for these repairs, which is why having a stable reserve fund for life lease complexes is of paramount importance. Perhaps, like condo owners, these seniors in life leases should have the peace of mind that their building’s management team is well trained and competent, not just someone’s relative who is given the job because of their relationship. This is why we must legislate a requirement for life lease sponsors to maintain a reserve fund to pay for any unforeseen major repairs or replacement of assets. This fund must be funded at a stable and secure level at all times on the first occupancy date of the complex.", "One of the most common complaints I have heard from life lease residents is on the lack of transparency and respectful interaction with complex management. Much like a condominium board, a vigilant and engaged residents’ association could provide valuable oversight to ensure that a facility’s management staff are held to the same high standards as condominium managers.", "With this in mind, this bill requires that the sponsors hold at least four general meetings a year, so that tenants can share their concerns. At least one of these would serve the purpose of an annual general meeting to review the financial situation and the projected budget for the complex’s operation. These meetings will ensure that life lease holders have a venue to have their voices heard and their issues dealt with.", "A key concern that I heard many times was about the disclosure of information about the refund that tenants or their estates will receive upon termination of a lease. Estate planning is a stressful and time-consuming endeavour for seniors. This bill seeks to reduce that burden for holders of life leases. Currently, there are several ways that refunds can be determined, which range from getting no money back at all to actually seeing a profit determined by inflation and/or the increased market value of the unit. It is not the goal of this bill to decide the model that a life lease community uses to determine refunds. However, seniors deserve a transparent and accepted method to protect the return on their investment.", "Life lease complexes are not just a place for our seniors to live. They are more than the bricks and mortar of which they are made. These complexes allow our seniors to maintain their independence while enjoying fewer responsibilities, like not having to mow the lawn or shovel the snow.", "One of the real attractions of living in a life lease complex is the sense of community it provides for our seniors. We know that a vibrant and active community can help give a senior a healthier and happier lifestyle. There’s a peace of mind that comes from knowing there’s always a neighbour nearby when you need a hand. Living in a community with people who share your values and lifestyle can also provide great comfort in a rapidly changing world.", "Some seniors do not want to pay rent in an apartment building or retirement community. As former homeowners who value investment in property, they see renting as an unwise use of their money, with very little return. Life leases help them to safely maintain their capital for the future.", "One of my constituents, a man whose parents were living in a life lease, spoke with us about the benefits of their experience and where there was room for improvement. His parents’ investment in their life lease unit is guaranteed and, as a result, they feel more secure in their financial stability. Without fear that their rent or condo fees would unexpectedly increase, they are able to prepare for the day when they may have to move on to long-term care, and would have some resources to do so through this plan.", "My constituent also spoke highly of the amenities and the activities offered to his parents and their fellow residents. Life leases often offer classes such as woodworking, senior fitness, live entertainment sometimes broadcast directly to their suites, library services and onsite retail stores to provide basic essentials. Many even offer a level of personal and medical care, including assisted bathing, on-site nursing and physiotherapy.", "Despite the benefits his parents experienced, my constituent feels there is room for improvement. They felt that they had very little input into the operation of their life lease. While their building did have a residents’ association, it only dealt with trivial matters such as when and how to set up and take down the Christmas decorations. He expressed that his parents wished to have a voice in the important matters of the building, to ensure the long-term sustainability of their complex, just like the rights that condominium owners have.", "Residents, many of them with varied work experience and skills, would be an asset to these facilities. With a real voice, they will be as committed to their building and investment as they were to their own homes. This bill gives them the well-earned opportunity to have that voice.", "Life leases, if regulated properly, can be of great benefit to our society. One senior living in a life lease in Barrie put it this way: “The chance to live completely independently, yet amid like-minded people, is a cause to celebrate.” Let’s not let such celebrations be marred by an unregulated industry.", "Today, we have the opportunity to secure protections for senior citizens throughout the province. We have spent a great deal of effort to protect the rights of renters under Bill 124, condo owners with the Condominium Act, and the new home warranties plan that will make Tarion more protective of home buyers. It is time that we make sure seniors who have invested their life savings in these life leases have equal protections.", "Life lease projects are a fantastic housing option for thousands of seniors throughout Ontario, but we must make this option better by ensuring that these projects are governed by rules and regulations under the force of law.", "Today, I call on this House to support this bill, and ask you to vote in favour of the Life Leases Act, 2017. Ensuring safe and affordable housing for these seniors is our moral duty and a way to enrich the standard of living in our province for these seniors." ],

This challenge is exacerbated by the backlog of repairs required in public housing. In conjunction, the focus on condominium building, and the resulting lack of apartment construction, has pushed the market rates of rents upwards in most major cities.", "For seniors living in Ontario, living in an urban core is no longer a priority, especially if they are able to find a local community that suits their needs. An option which is growing in popularity in different parts of Ontario is life lease developments. As the member from Barrie did point out, they can be found across Canada but are primarily in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. It’s estimated that there are 300 life lease developments in place at the present time.", "A particular advantage of the life lease style of residence is that an individual is able to purchase a right-to-occupy apartment below market price and pay a monthly maintenance fee.", "At the time when life leases were not as widespread as they are today, several purchasers of units did not have legal oversight of their contract. Some individuals have faced problems because important items were not clearly laid out.", "While Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta have legislation governing life lease residences, Bill 155, as it should, would do the same in Ontario.", "However, I am concerned that there seems to have been little consultation on this bill thus far. Clearly, this is a real, complex issue. I would urge, at the very least, engagement with the Ontario Ministry of Seniors Affairs Liaison Committee. The Ministry of Seniors Affairs Liaison Committee is chaired by the assistant deputy minister of that ministry. It allows for communication to happen between the government and seniors organizations in Ontario on topics of proposed legislation, policies and programs.", "The Ministry of Seniors Affairs Liaison Committee’s mandate is, among others, to identify issues and concerns of Ontario seniors with provincial government services in an aging society.", "Given the knowledge and expertise that resides with the members of this committee, I’m confident that we would receive, and in particular the member for Barrie would receive, the advice required to strengthen this proposed legislation.", "As written, the bill does not provide any real certainty for seniors. For example, the information that the landlord is required to disclose to the tenant is either estimated or projected, so it potentially could all be varied. This includes the estimated entrance fee, the projected completion date, the estimated amount of other fees to be charged, and the estimated amount of the refund to be received on termination of the lease. As a consequence, it’s absolutely critical that a public education campaign is undertaken to explain the provisions and nuances of the bill and how seniors and others could be affected.", "Once again, the Ministry of Seniors Affairs Liaison Committee would be a good sounding board for advice on what communication features could potentially be included in a communications plan.", "In closing, Speaker, this legislation is long overdue. It establishes a very important framework to protect seniors about to enter into a life lease agreement. At the end of the day, this is about enhancing the quality of life and supporting the needs and values of seniors in our communities across Ontario. After all, they built the communities we all live in today." ],

I really like Thursday afternoons because we get many opportunities to talk about bills that are near and dear to us, or issues that have been brought forward to us by our constituents—in this case, the member from Barrie, regarding life leases.", "When this bill was brought forward—in our part of Ontario, a great province, we have issues with seniors being able to find housing—I had never heard of this concept. So thank you for bringing this bill forward once again. I had the opportunity to do some research on it and see how, why and where this type of arrangement would work.", "For many, it is a good arrangement. We often talk about regulation, about whether there’s too much regulation or not enough regulation. Well, in this case, regulation is a good thing. When people are investing in something for their own protection, for a big part of their lives—and a part of their lives where they don’t want to spend their time worrying about what’s going to go wrong next. That’s one of the benefits of this type of arrangement. A seniors’ community needs to have the assurance that when they decide to participate in a life lease—the thing they’re really looking for is a great place to live, a quality place to live, with no surprises, and the only way we are able to provide that is with regulation.", "It has also come to my attention that things we assume are very well regulated—because they have something to do with what you would think would be the public interest—often aren’t. This would be an example.", "Am I going to say that this bill is perfect? No. Has there ever been perfect legislation drafted? Have we ever had the perfect private member’s bill—except if I bring one forward? Just kidding.", "This private member’s bill brings forward an issue that needs to be discussed. It brings forward an issue where regulations need to be instituted.", "If I have any criticism of this, it is that this issue is something that—and I’m very confident that the member is doing it because the member is a member of the government. This is an issue that the government could perhaps bring forward, and this is a tool for a member within the government to do that. I appreciate that. We’re in full support of this going forward, but we would also like to urge the government to demonstrate that they take this issue seriously and look at this issue themselves.", "We commend the member from Barrie for bringing this issue to the forefront. We all, in our ridings, have heard horror stories about lack of housing and, certainly in my part of the world, people who live in substandard housing because there’s just a lack. This is a pretty good idea for a lot of people.", "Again—and the member said it in her remarks, and I agree—there are good examples where this works very well. But the role of government, unfortunately—the vast majority of all types of housing or whatever type of business transactions that occur are good, and the same with the health care system. The vast majority of transactions in the health care system are good. But when they’re not, they’re incredibly tragic.", "That’s what regulations are for: 95% of regulations are to stop the 0.5% of people who are the bad actors. That’s why you need regulations.

They want to stay where their friends are and be in the communities that they have built, and don’t necessarily want to move into a retirement community or long-term-care home. I can see why the life leases that were described by the member from Barrie would be a useful tool and a desirable option for seniors across our province.", "It’s important to note that the majority of life leases operate well and are run with the residents’ best interests in mind. But as we know, with all new tools, there are sometimes growing pains—or those who want to exploit our seniors for their own gain. That is why I’m so glad the member from Barrie has presented this bill to bring clear disclosure and improved communications on both sides.", "I found it interesting to learn from the member that life leases are governed almost exclusively by contract law in Ontario, and that Manitoba is the only province with comprehensive legislation on the subject. I think that this bill is strong because it brings us in line with a standard that is proven to have worked.", "I also like that this bill doesn’t standardize life leases under one model, but instead improves protections by providing that certain information be clearly disclosed to ensure frequent and productive communications between tenants and sponsors, and to help seniors better plan their lives and protect their investments. Seniors have provided so much to our province, and we have the duty to ensure that the deals they enter into are properly documented and disclosed.", "I again want to thank the member from Barrie for introducing this bill and providing this House with the opportunity to secure protections for senior citizens in my riding of Davenport and across Ontario.

I want to start by saying that I support the intent of this bill to protect our vulnerable seniors, and I appreciate that the member from Barrie has brought forward this bill to address this issue.", "Life leases are an interesting option for seniors. They’re designed as an option between owning a home and renting an apartment. They’re intended to provide a stable, affordable place for seniors who may not be able to live in their own home anymore. In fact, the number of projects being built in Ontario makes it clear that seniors are choosing life leases. They may be particularly attractive because our housing shortage in Ontario limits other options. We’ve heard a lot of conversation about the “missing middle” and the need for more rental units. Given the shortage of those options, seniors need an alternative. Life leases give them another option.", "In most cases, it appears that choosing a life lease unit is cheaper than moving into a condominium. However, unlike a condominium building, where residents are also the owners, in a life lease the resident only buys the right to occupy the unit, not the unit itself. The property and the unit are still owned by the private company.", "As was mentioned earlier, in most life leases the purchaser will provide a significant initial payment up front. This means that if there are challenges with the management of the property and the amounts charged, the senior is limited in their ability to move. Many of our seniors are on fixed incomes, so if they move into the unit expecting the monthly fees to be a certain amount and those fees increase dramatically, the senior may feel trapped and be forced to give up other necessities in order to pay for the cost of shelter.", "We understand why these seniors need extra protection. Unfortunately, I don’t believe this bill, as written, will provide all the protection these seniors need.", "This bill requires the landlord to provide the estimated entrance fee, projected completion date, estimated amount of monthly fees to be charged and the estimated amount of the refund that the tenant would receive upon termination of the lease. The key words are “projected” and “estimated.”", "There are clauses in this bill that now protect seniors if a project is not completed by the projected date. However, what about cases where the project is delayed but the value has increased, so the life lease holder wants to continue to hold the lease? We’ve seen that many times with condo buildings in Toronto. In this bill, it seems to me that if a landlord actually wanted to break the agreement, all he would have to do is miss the projected completion date. I would think that if a completion date is missed by a certain time period, it should be the life lease holder’s option to cancel and not be automatic, as it appears to be.", "One of my other concerns is with the number of costs that are “estimated.” I understand that it may not be possible to put exact amounts on some of these items. No one would have predicted the hydro increases that we have seen over the last few years in Ontario. If businesses were locked in to very small increases without any ability to recoup those extra costs, they are going to have trouble with maintenance and other repairs. In fact, that is exactly the situation that this government has created for the rental housing providers by applying rent control to all units and eliminating the above-guideline increases for utility costs. They’ve seen the impact of that already, as 1,000 planned rental units have been removed from the pipeline.", "At the same time, there needs to be some protection for seniors. They are going to receive a piece of paper that gives their estimated monthly costs and think that they can bank on that, when in reality there is nothing in this bill that prevents that cost from being doubled or tripled.", "Perhaps the bill could require a range of increases, so a landlord could say that increases will be between 0% and 5% and that they would be required to keep in that range. It would provide knowledge for the land leaseholder and flexibility for the company. Perhaps the landlord could be required to provide a maximum percentage increase and only be allowed to go a certain amount above that. There are a number of options, and I think we need extensive consultation with both the landlords and the life lease holders to find the right solution. What we shouldn’t have is seniors purchasing life leases, believing they are protected, and then finding out that’s not the case.", "I want to say again that I support the intent of this bill. The member for Barrie has done a lot of work over the last year to address some of the concerns we discussed the last time we debated life leases. She has added a cooling-off period and a requirement for the entrance fee to be paid into a trust account, both of which I recommended last year. It is nice to see that during these debates, we can actually work together and make legislation better, and I want to commend the member for that.", "There are still some areas of the bill where I believe we can make this bill more effective, such as the estimates that I mentioned earlier. I believe that in order to get these issues right, the bill requires significant consultation with those that will be impacted.", "That raises another concern. A year and a half ago, we supported the earlier version of this bill on second reading so it could get to committee and have the extensive consultations that it needed. Today, we are planning to do the same thing. I’m disappointed that the government hasn’t addressed this in the 20 months since the previous bill was passed. Last spring, the government introduced a bill to amend the Residential Tenancies Act and didn’t include anything on life lease communities. They announced a 16-point housing plan, and there was nothing to protect seniors who live in life lease communities.", "I encourage the government to listen to the member from Barrie and to take steps to protect those seniors, and I want to commend the member for raising this issue and for the work she has done in strengthening this bill over the last 20 months. I hope that the government will agree and send this bill to committee." ],

It’s very important that this government is finally introducing legislation to implement regulations where the finances and aspects of disclosure between the life lease holder and the sponsor or the landlord are concerned. The rights and the dignity of seniors, who are the major demographic who enter into these agreements, need to be protected and explicitly defined in this bill.", "In my community of London–Fanshawe, there is a vibrant, growing, aging community of seniors. When a senior makes a difficult and challenging decision to move out of their home and into a new home, whether it’s an apartment, a condominium or a life lease unit, they deserve to have all the information about their security, safety and finances up front. If this bill becomes law, the government owes it to our province’s seniors to make it abundantly clear what the risks and the potential disadvantages of moving into a life lease unit are.", "There are certain attractive qualities for people interested in moving into a life lease unit. Many of these units and complexes integrate a community approach and allow seniors to participate and engage in social activities. Many life lease properties have meal plans and recreational activities built into their programming; freedom from the responsibility of a mortgage; the possibility of exemption from land transfer taxes; and fewer responsibilities where home upkeep and maintenance are concerned and the responsibilities that come along with owning a large asset such as a piece of real estate.", "But the design and approach of life leasing properties is entirely dependent on the individual sponsors and groups who run them and the owners of the properties themselves. As there are currently no regulations in place for tenants who are life lease holders, people are often left to lodge complaints with the ministry, but by the time they have identified a problem, they are already locked into a contract.", "The purpose of this bill is to establish a process for life lease holders to ensure that seniors’ rights are protected, as life lease holders are not protected under the Residential Tenancies Act or the Condominium Act.", "Despite paying a large sum to move into one of these properties, life lease holders do not own the unit they live in and are not guaranteed security in the long term, or the return of their entrance fee. While there are certainly many benefits associated with living in a life lease unit, such as active, independent living, many of its terms are potentially problematic and worrisome.", "Many contracts that tenants enter into stipulate that sponsors or landlords only require 30 days before ending a lease, and there are various reasons that the sponsor can decide to terminate the contract.", "If a tenant becomes unable to look after themselves, they can be required to vacate the premises, which presents many problems with aging seniors.", "While there are limited units or complexes that provide different levels of care to seniors living in life lease units, many will not allow family members or caregivers, part-time or full-time, to live in the residence, as it makes the life lease unit unmarketable or interferes with its age requirements.", "The considerable entrance fee that seniors pay is not necessarily returned, and is contingent on inflation and what is considered market value at any given moment. Again, this is something that should be made explicitly clear to seniors and prospective tenants.", "Another major problem is with the subletting of life lease units. Many sponsors have specific criteria where subletting a unit is concerned, and more landlords forbid it outright. In the event where landlords do allow a tenant to sublet their unit, they are often not allowed to be part of the process of selecting a subtenant and, as I touched on earlier, a landlord may stipulate that the original tenant is able to live independently in order to be eligible to sublet.", "A central contradiction here is that the life leases are targeted towards seniors, and seniors will be aging in these units or complexes, and will likely encounter health complications. If a tenant is forced to spend an extended period of time in hospital, for instance, the landlord may terminate the contract, as the tenant is no longer able to live independently.", "Again, while certain life lease properties have various levels of care already built into their programming, oftentimes landlords stipulate that family members or home care workers are not permitted to live with tenants who may require additional help with their day-to-day lives. Seniors who find themselves in need of additional care may require entrance into long-term care and will find themselves on a waiting list of nearly 30,000 people.", "I hope this bill, if passed, addresses the issues which, frankly, are discriminatory and sometimes ageist towards seniors in the way that it’s set up. Seniors often have complex needs associated with their health and, subsequently, housing. The government has a responsibility to address the rights of seniors when considering implementing the various regulations for life leases.", "I commend the member for bringing this issue forward. It certainly is important, and when we get it to committee, I hope the complex issues that I’ve described are considered. When it comes to aging in your home, not everyone can, if there are these kinds of restrictions with regard to caregivers being able to look after someone under the life lease contract." ],

I certainly learned some stuff about what the real meaning of life leases is, and I think that, in itself, will help me if I come across issues. Frankly, I haven’t run across any specific issues with life leases in my riding. There probably are some life leases, I would admit and I would suspect, but certainly I haven’t been approached with any of those issues.", "What is life lease housing? Life lease buyers are often seniors—and we’ve heard that a number of times today—who are looking to move into a smaller home. Some reasons why people choose life leases include such things as less home maintenance responsibilities. That’s why it caters well to seniors: They don’t have to have that responsibility. In many cases, it’s access to social and recreational programs that are conducted within that complex, and sometimes care and meal services offered by sponsors on that particular site. You know, every site could be different, as I learned, Madam Speaker, which is okay.", "The sense of community is also very, very important. I especially find that—Speaker, I’m sure you do too—during election times when we go knocking on doors, we find some seniors who welcome the opportunity to have a face-to-face conversation. This will allow some of these folks to have that at their doorstep.", "The other piece, I think, is the affordability piece. In many cases, this is more affordable than condominiums, and once again, it relieves seniors from a lot of pressure so that they can focus on their well-being.", "When a person buys a life lease, they sign an agreement with a sponsor. The agreement does not give the buyer property. Instead, it gives the buyer the right to occupy the unit until they sell the life lease or pass away. That’s a very broad statement. What the member is trying to do is put some definition around the legality and how things would work, so that it protects the occupant of the life lease, because in many cases—you know and I know—sometimes seniors don’t have the capacity to understand some of those issues. Having something that’s inscribed in law, even if they don’t understand it—the agreements will help them to deal with it and navigate through it.", "What does the right to occupy really mean, Madam Speaker? In life lease housing, you do not own that property, as I said before. You own an interest in that property. The life lease interest gives you the right to occupy, which means to live in, a unit rather than owning the unit itself. That gives the occupier of the property some security, but it also leaves some freedom. Frankly, I think, at the end of the day, it’s also good for the sponsor of the property because it really clarifies the playing field.", "Madam Speaker, I want to again thank the member for bringing this to our attention.

You would hope it would mostly be run by non-profits, community groups, cultural groups, religious groups, who really are doing it a little bit more for the community or for the more vulnerable people in the community who need a little bit more support.

It’s this creature that is in between these two, so sometimes when you are a hybrid, a number of acts already do apply to life leases. Some of the provisions of Ontario’s many laws do apply, but there are certain areas where it gets tricky because it’s not entirely renting and it’s not entirely ownership. There are certain areas that certainly merit looking at whether we need to provide further protections. I have to say that I really, really applaud the intent of the bill because what it’s trying to do is plug a gap.", "I also very much like the idea that was raised by the member from Whitby–Oshawa, which was about shopping this bill with my ministry’s seniors liaison committee. Thank you so much. That’s a really good idea. That was something I was going to say but you beat me to it. It’s a good idea.", "A bill like this is a very complex issue. There are a lot of potential unintended consequences. It’s a very good idea. It’s trying to fix certain gaps that are real. But we want to make sure that, obviously, there are no unintended consequences. Some of the things that the bill is trying to do, particularly around the reserve fund—the example that the member raised about reserve funds from one set of life lease payers, the funds being siphoned off to be used to maintain another building—are sort of egregious. The fact that something egregious like that can take place—that example is a powerful reminder as to the gaps that this bill is trying to plug.", "I do want to say one thing: I want to thank the member for not only shining a light on this very important issue, but also that the Ontario government has taken some steps in order to raise greater consumer awareness. As I was saying to the member, and the member from Barrie has said this many times, sometimes seniors may buy a life lease and not know all of the implications, not be entirely sure. It’s a very sophisticated financial product that they’re entering into and they may not always know all of the fine print.", "The Ontario government has actually released something called the Life Lease Housing Resource Guide. I know we’re not allowed to use props. I just want to say I have a copy of it on my desk. It’s an excellent resource guide, and I would encourage anybody planning to get into a life lease arrangement to definitely first read this resource guide.", "Once again, I want to thank and applaud the member for shining a light on this very important issue." ],

They were a small militia who blew up 216 Russian tanks with Molotov cocktails and drove the Russians out of Budapest. A week later, the Russians came back with 3,000 tanks and 100,000 soldiers.

Vimy Ridge was a defining moment in Canadian history and is often referred to as the moment when Canada became a truly independent nation. Bob began his quest to have the battle recognized in 1998 and subsequently enlisted the help of MP Brent St. Denis to shepherd a bill through the House of Commons. Bill C-227 was passed unanimously in the House in October 2002 and the Senate April 3, 2003, and given royal assent the same day to become a nationally recognized day to honour the 3,598 soldiers who gave their lives in the three-day battle.

For a number of years, my husband was the deputy chief of staff to Peter MacKay. He went to Afghanistan twice—non-combat. He would always send me photos when he was in Afghanistan, and sometimes in very dangerous circumstances, to show us that little girls were going to school in Afghanistan because of Canadian soldiers. I always want to make that point, when we talk about our veterans and soldiers, that in the world, they have made change. We have made change in World War I, in World War II, in the Korean War and in the Bosnian conflict; we made change in Afghanistan; and right now, we have soldiers who are making change around the world. They come back as veterans, and the member rightfully said that no veteran should come back to this country homeless or without opportunity, and we must be able to thank them appropriately. That is the right thing to do, in my humble opinion.", "My first private member’s bill, actually, had to do with veterans, and one of the things I felt lacking—and I’m going to wrap it up very quickly—one of the things I have always felt lacking in Ontario, particularly because we do have the Highway of Heroes, which is a wonderful initiative and a great outpouring of support, but I’ve always felt we should have had, because we have so many soldiers coming from this province, a parliamentary assistant or a minister responsible for our veterans and soldiers.", "With that, Speaker, I just want to conclude by saying that I know a number of members had the opportunity to talk about the Invictus Games; I had the opportunity to go on Saturday. I always get quite emotional because of our connection to the military in my family, but I was so proud to see our soldiers fighting for this common goal of challenging themselves in sport. I cried the minute I saw the folks from Afghanistan there because it was such a beautiful moment of synergy with our soldiers and those who fought alongside them coming to our country.", "I remind members, it is said that freedom is never free.

Nicholas was just a young man when I was first elected. He had been dabbling with drugs, and his mum and dad came to see me. Back then, about 12 years ago, we weren’t really talking much about alcohol, drugs, mental health, addictions and other things, and it was very difficult to find Nick the appropriate assistance. Throughout the years, I would follow the family and see how he was doing. Eventually, he passed away from a very bad pill a few years ago.", "That wasn’t my only experience. Back in early 2012, there had been a rash of fentanyl overdoses, including a couple of fatalities by some young kids who were stealing fentanyl patches and sniffing them or smoking them. I worked very hard with the Ottawa police, as well as the Royal Ottawa mental health hospital to bring an opioid resource centre to our community. Naively, I thought, “Well, we fixed that problem.” The problem is, however, that since last February, as I have learned, the counterfeit drugs on our streets are being laced with fentanyl, which is more powerful than morphine. Kids as young as 10 years old and 12 years old are taking these drugs. Some of them are dying the first time they take the pill because they’re so potent and they’re so deadly.", "Last February, I read a post on social media that was sent to me by a family friend. It was an open letter from a man named Sean O’Leary. Over Christmas of last year, Sean came home to an overdose in his garage by one of his daughter’s friends. They were able to bring the young fellow back to life through a naloxone kit. But Sean’s troubles were only starting because that’s when he recognized the fact that his own daughter, Paige, was using these dangerous opioids, and he was finding out how many kids were actually overdosing and then coming back to life through this naloxone, or they were dying—absolutely tragic.", "Sean brought me to a meeting and I got to meet three kids, all 17, two girls and a boy. The boy had been using these drugs. He’s been in and out of detention. Another girl witnessed the overdose of a friend in the garage. Finally, the one that has stuck with me more than any story I’ve heard about drug abuse was a 17-year-old girl who told me she started taking drugs at the age of 10. She told me she had overdosed multiple times, and when I asked her how she felt about coming so close to death, this is what she said: “When I’m high, I don’t care if I die. When I’m not high, I think about the pain I’ve put my family through, and I just want to die.” Seventeen years old; this is what these drugs are doing to people—and youth, in particular—at such a young age.", "Sean started this group called We the Parents. That’s when I got rekindled with Steve and Natalie Cody. After all of those years of trying to work to help them, and them losing their son, I got to work with them again. They’re trying desperately to spread the word, to prevent kids from taking that first pill, so that when they go to a party they know that that bowl of pills—they should just stay away from it. They want that conversation, which is why, over the summer, when I was working with them and suggested that I wanted to put a bill forward that talked about more awareness and education in Ontario for our youth, they suggested it be named after Nick, the first youth I met who was struggling. I was happy to do that.", "Since February, I have discussed on multiple occasions and many times in this House—going back and forth through questions or through statements and even here right now—the need for a task force on this opioid emergency. I was proud to be in the room just yesterday, when our Minister of Health for the province of Ontario announced that they were going to initiate that.", "I have been an advocate for more naloxone kits, equipment not only for our first responders, but I believe they need to be in our schools as well. I think it’s important that any parent actually right now who has a child anywhere between the ages of 10 to 110 actually gets a kit. My husband and I have one, ourselves, in our car.", "I’m pleased to say that my husband, Joe Varner, is the national capital chair of St. John Ambulance. Just today, at lunchtime, he was there saying thank you to the trainers for their first aid. They were being taught naloxone kits, thanks to Sobeys and Ottawa Public Health. And I would be remiss not to say thank you to Dr. Isra Levy of Ottawa Public Health, who I know has been working hard trying to catch up on this.", "I’ve also talked about the need for more detoxification beds, better treatment resources and more treatment beds for rehabilitation. That is sorely lacking. We’re trying to catch up in the province of Ontario, but it’s an area where I believe it’s needed.", "Remember the girl I told you about, who was 10 years old? She told me that when she was about 14, she wanted to detox. She was sent to a detoxification centre where 50-year-old men were also being detoxed. I don’t think that’s right. I think that there needs to be special detoxification units simply for our youth. If they are prepared and they want to go, they need that help.", "I’ve been very open and I’ve communicated quite a bit about that, but I think one of the things—and this is what this bill, Nick’s Law, is about. It’s saying that we spend $56.6 million on government advertising; 10% of that is $5.6 million. It’s the same amount of money that we paid for the fair hydro ads. It’s the same amount of money that we paid for the ORPP ads, and the ORPP was scrapped. I’m suggesting that we take that same 10%, that $5.6 million, and invest it into greater education and awareness with this crisis.", "And here’s the kicker: This new fentanyl that’s been in our province for about two years, which is more potent than morphine, more potent than heroin—it’s about to get a lot worse. It’s about to get way worse, because just yesterday they found that the most deadly type of fentanyl, which is 100,000 times or 10,000 times more potent than morphine, carfentanil, is on the streets in Ottawa. We need to warn people that this drug is out there and just one dose—not 10, not 20; one dose—could kill. If there is one thing we want to ensure with Nick’s Law, it is that the kids today at 10, 11 and 12 years old, not just 17, 18 and 19 years old, know that these drugs are out there. They could be sold for as little as $3. They could come in a little pink heart. You can take one and die.", "That’s why I had Steve and Natalie Cody and their other son, Darren, here to talk about this, so that we could encourage the government to provide enough awareness and education so that no other Ontario family has to go through what they have when they lost Nick, who was just a teenager.", "My request of this assembly is to continue the debate on this opioid crisis. It’s to continue the debate on how we can best reach our youth, and other people as well, but particularly our youth, so that they know the dangers of taking that one pill when they’re at a party; so that they know that this could be potentially fatal; so that we can reach parents and others to say there is a way to assist people.", "There is no one silver bullet or magic bullet that is going to fix this crisis overnight. I will have people say to me, “Lisa, your bill is only about advertising or awareness. What about more beds?” Yes, we need more beds, but we need to prevent people from actually going into those beds, and the best way to do that is to communicate. That’s what Nick’s Law wants to do. It wants to start there. It’s a whole spectrum. You want to prevent, and so that’s where your awareness comes in. You want to treat, which is where your naloxone kit comes in and then the treatment beds. Then you want to help people detox so that they can have assistance, and then you want to have community resources. We need all that, and that’s why I think it’s going to go very nicely hand in glove with the government’s task force that will look at all parts of this issue.", "So to the pages here today, you are going back to your communities next week. You’re all going right across the province of Ontario. You can be our ambassadors for what you have learned here today in this debate and the questions the minister and I have exchanged about how dangerous these can be.", "I have to tell you something in last 30 seconds I have: Before I met Sean O’Leary, I never would have guessed that kids under the age of 14 would take drugs. I must be naive. But today is a whole different world and my eyes are wide open.", "I ask all members of this assembly to continue this debate, to support Nick’s Law, and let’s take this very public health crisis seriously." ],

I think an effective program—I don’t need to talk about where it’s set up, who does it, what platform. An effective program of communication that moves people emotionally to understand the risk they are putting themselves at, and their families and their friends, could be a very powerful tool.", "The member talked very specifically about the individual situations of people who are dealing with this drug issue. I want to just pull back a bit and look at some of the statistics, because a few years ago, I had a constituent in my riding, a doctor, come in to talk about the opioid crisis and the need to take this on. At the time he said to me, “More people die from opioid-related causes than die from traffic accidents, from car crashes,” which completely took me aback. I didn’t think of it being at that scale, but I actually had an opportunity before I stood up to look at the statistics. In 2016 in Canada, there were 2,458 people who died from opioid-related causes. That doesn’t include Quebec; those statistics were incomplete. That’s 8.8 people per 100,000. When you look at auto-related deaths, the year before, in 2015, it was 1,858 people, a fatality rate of 5.1 persons per 100,000.", "There’s no question at all. If we think about the carnage we see on our roads, if we think about traffic accidents, if we think about the amount of time, effort and legislative focus that we put on dealing with car-related deaths—we’ve got a problem here that’s bigger than car-related deaths. Maybe it’s not as visible; you don’t have police tape around alleyways, but you do have police tape and auto routes shut down, expressways shut down when you have a big accident. This problem, however, is having a larger impact on life and death rates in this country.", "I have to say that in talking to that doctor, who talked about a variety of different paths to get at this problem, one of the paths he talked about was dealing with people who are exposed to painkillers on a regular basis because they don’t get drugless therapy. I said, “What do you mean, drugless therapy?” He said, “Physiotherapy.” For people who have a bad back or shoulder or neck pain, an awful lot of that can be relieved with the application of physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Yet more often than not, because coverage of that treatment is so limited, people rely on painkillers prescribed by their doctors.", "I have in my riding a number of methadone clinics. Speaker, they are controversial. Neighbours don’t like them, so I actually go and talk to the doctors who are running them. I remember talking to a doctor on the Danforth who went through some of the life stories of people who came to see him, people who had had severe cases of cancer, surgery, chemo, radiation, took a lot of painkillers and ultimately wound up addicted to opioids and needed to access methadone as a way of dealing with that addiction.", "He talked about one person who came in to see him who said that they could never have imagined earlier in their lives that they would find themselves holding up a variety store for the cash to go out and buy drugs. So there’s a question here of injuries, of fatalities, but there’s also a question of disruption of society overall when people have an addiction that’s so powerful, they engage in violent, illegal behaviour to deal with their craving for opioids.", "I think what the member has brought forward makes sense. I’m very glad she looked at the broader range of things that have to be done, and she spoke about them quite eloquently: an investment in detox beds; an investment in addiction treatment; an availability of naloxone so that in acute cases, people are saved, quite literally, from dying on the spot—all of those things, put together with a program of public consciousness of the scale of this public health crisis and an investment in public education through media to make sure that people aren’t unknowingly, perhaps, taking a medication that will kill them on the spot.", "My thanks to the member.

With these illicit drugs, regrettably, the users, whether chronic users or new users, have generally no knowledge that these drugs they may be getting access to and taking are poisoned.", "We’re seeing, as a result of that, a dramatic escalation in deaths, and non-fatal overdoses as well. Last year, 865 Ontarians died of opioid overdose. It’s a startling number, and I fear that that number has grown even higher this year, because we’re seeing it in the increase in visits to our ERs for overdoses.", "The government has responded, and I can say that for nearly two years this has been top-of-mind for myself. Our actions go back that long, to the naloxone distribution that is being referred to, where roughly 7,000 naloxone kits are distributed every single month through public health units, through our agencies, through community agencies that are able to access vulnerable individuals, through 150 different communities and, I think, through 1,500 pharmacies now that provide naloxone free of charge.", "We’re expanding access to detox, to withdrawal management services, to day and overnight supportive care for those who seek help, to rapid-response clinics and to pain management clinics. We are literally finding every possible touchpoint to address this epidemic that we’re facing.", "Speaker, a couple of nights ago the Premier and I had the opportunity and the privilege to visit Moss Park at the pop-up site, the overdose prevention site located in downtown Toronto. We met many individuals—harm-reduction workers, front-line health care professionals—who were volunteering their time and literally are saving lives every day at that location. They are courageous individuals, absolutely professional and absolutely committed to what they are trying to do. They are trying to provide that life-saving access to individuals in need.", "The Premier and I also had the opportunity and the privilege to speak with five active users. Madam Speaker, it was often a difficult conversation, but I have to say that these were five remarkable individuals, and very courageous. Each of them, as well—we need to understand that those who are drug users in our society almost invariably come from a history of trauma. It may be sexual abuse as a child, it may be homelessness or it may be physical injury, but they are individuals who have faced circumstances few of us could imagine, and those circumstances catalyzed and led to where they find themselves today, as active drug users.", "Madam Speaker, what’s happening at Moss Park is absolutely necessary, and I defend and applaud those individuals who are providing that care. We still are not succeeding enough to ensure that we are saving every single preventable—well, every one of those lives lost is a preventable death, so there’s much, much more work to be done.", "Part of that work, as the member has described and as certainly is encompassed in her bill, is greater public education and awareness. That’s another point through which we can prevent deaths. That includes a broad-based education and awareness campaign that aims to reach every segment of our society that can come into contact with both prescription drugs and prescription opioids, but particularly the tainted, poisoned illicit drugs which we’re finding in our society and in our streets.", "We’re working, Madam Speaker, with our public health units. We’re making sure that they have the most up-to-date education and awareness materials, so they can share them with their community partners and with the front-line health care workers who can provide that support. We’re working with the Ministry of Education and our education partners to ensure that we’re creating appropriate, accessible, impactful education and awareness tools that can reach into our high schools, our colleges and our universities and alert individuals and their families to the dangers inherent in illicit drugs.", "We’re also cognizant that we need to reach into bars and nightclubs, and we’re working to do just that so we can reach, touch, impact and educate individuals who may frequent those establishments. We’re working and dialoguing with harm reduction workers to ensure that through them we’re providing those appropriate tools and education and awareness materials so that those who are chronic users, like those the Premier and I met two days ago at Moss Park, have the information they need.", "We’re working with our pharmacists, as well, to ensure on the prescription side that when an individual goes to a pharmacist and obtains a new, or even a renewed prescription, with that prescription being dispensed they will get materials to alert them to the risk of opioids and the addiction potential.", "There are, as you can appreciate, many touch points. I’m gratified, as well, that yesterday I announced the creation of an opioid emergency taskforce which will be comprised of a whole myriad of experts and advisers, but particularly, it will contain and benefit from the participation of and the advice from harm reduction workers, people with lived experience, clinicians and others who can truly help us take those next steps to both alleviate and reduce the impact of this scourge, this epidemic. Hopefully, Madam Speaker, it can result in the elimination of the epidemic and the public health emergency.", "Madam Speaker, I am thankful that the member opposite has brought this bill forward. As I said this morning, it is brought forward with the most genuine of intent, passion and compassion for this issue. I know that both of us have had many conversations about our shared concern about the opioid crisis, and I applaud her and thank her for bringing forward a bill that speaks to that critically important—it’s not the only solution, and she has mentioned that herself—aspect of awareness and education." ],

This is just a particularly touching topic in the middle of such a crisis.", "As I stated a week or so ago in a recent debate on Bill 126, we are indeed in the midst of an opioid crisis. Between 2006 and 2015, fentanyl overdose deaths in Ontario soared by 548%. Last month, we got word that opioid-related deaths rose 19% in 2016 in Ontario. You may recall, Speaker, that after 15 fentanyl deaths in my hometown of North Bay, the leaders there came together with their drug strategy committee and developed a Patch for Patch program—you’ll see why I’m talking about this in a moment. Patch for Patch is a protocol that basically states that before you can get a new fentanyl patch, for those who need it by prescription, you return the used patch undamaged. It was a very successful program, which this Legislature adopted province-wide. Since that time, in my hometown, fentanyl-related deaths—remember, we had 15—are now zero. It has just stopped in its tracks, due primarily, at the time, to the Patch for Patch program.", "I relate this because it is my hope, and our hope, that this same kind of non-partisan lens is used to move this bill forward. Certainly today it sounds exactly like that is what’s happening. I think we’re all so grateful to see that. But we do want to see this go to a committee and come up to the committee and have hearings. We don’t just want to see it fall by the wayside after one wonderful day today.", "We saw Bill 126 recently—and this is from the member from Kitchener–Conestoga. This was his Illegal Pill Press Act—again, as the minister said, one more tool in the tool box to fight this scourge. That received non-partisan support, and hopefully that bill will also go to committee. But this is what we’re saying; this is what we’re hearing. They are all pieces that are part of this big puzzle to try to solve this, and I think that anything we can do in this Legislature to save lives, well, that ought to be something we do. I see the member from Nepean–Carleton doing that today.", "The Ontario PC Caucus has also urged the government to do more in the prevention of the opioid crisis, and we’re starting to hear things that I think we’re all pleased to hear—the task force that the minister announced. These are all critical pieces. Not one is going to solve it all, but cumulatively, these pieces will come together.", "We encourage the government, through this bill, to start advertising for public safety from public money. I think that’s what the member from Nepean–Carleton is really asking for here. Opioid overdoses are preventable. With more awareness and education, youth will have a better understanding of just how very lethal these opioids like fentanyl and, as you heard from the member from Nepean–Carleton, carfentanil—just how very deadly these are.", "Nick’s Law proposes allocating 10% of the government’s $57-million advertising budget to the fight against fentanyl and other dangerous opioids. It would establish campaigns to address the prevention of opioid abuse, talk about the early warning signs of addiction and the dangers associated. It would bring greater public awareness to the dangers associated with the drugs that are contaminated with fentanyl, much like the patch-for-patch return policy.", "Speaker, as in the past, I want to read a letter from Sherry Albert of New Liskeard, to remind members in this House what this is really all about. Sadly, she wrote to me:", "“In 2011, I lost my 19-year-old son to this tragic abuse of medication.", "“He was a gentle young man with many plans, who was at the wrong place at the wrong time and, as many others, did not know the dangers of prescription medication.", "“The police determined that fentanyl was sold to his friend for $100.", "“Since May, I have a heard of at least four more senseless, fentanyl-related deaths in our very small community. I, too, am afraid for our youth.", "“My life has been forever changed and my heart eternally broken by the loss caused by this serious problem.”", "It’s a reminder that there are families just like Sherry’s all across the province who are hurting. Their anguish is raw, human and real." ],

Those are critical supports. I also had health care if I needed it. I just want to say that those are still the critical supports needed to get off the streets, to get away from drugs, to get your life back in order.", "I want to thank the Minister of Health for the emergency task force. We in the New Democratic Party call for a state of emergency to be declared. This is almost as good. This is good. Thank you, because it’s absolutely essential.", "I want to put forward another notion—and I know it’s not within the domain of this House, but it’s something I think we need to advocate for with our federal cousins—and that is the decriminalization of all drugs. And I’ll tell you why: Because in Portugal, where they have decriminalized everything from weed to heroin for 17 years, there is a lived experiment that shows it works. I’ll tell you why decriminalization is so important: Because as long as drug use remains underground, as long as we are threatening children with prison time, they’re not going to talk to us. They’re not going to come out from the shadows. They’re not going to seek help. That’s why we need to decriminalize.", "Here are the results of that Portuguese experiment. There are just under 11 million in Portugal. That’s their population. They had 16 opioid deaths. Compare that to our 800-and-something. This is what happens when you allow those who are using to come out of the shadows and seek help—in fact, not only that they come out, but that you go looking for them.", "Remember, this is not legalizing drugs; it’s decriminalizing them. What happens is that the police interact with users and give them a citation. They go before a panel of health care workers, social workers and doctors, who are then able to help them. That’s the point. You get them into help. Traffickers are still prosecuted. You can imagine that the police costs are halved from what they used to be as well. The money that the government saves goes into what? Treatment, because that’s the other piece of the puzzle.", "If a child has a problem—and they do, if they’re using fentanyl—we need to get them help. As the member from Nepean–Carleton said, just going into detox with 50-year-old men is not going to cut it. Children—and we’re talking about children—need their own help, and they need long-term rehab help. If you look to try to find it, you will find it, but it costs. The wait-list for free help is so long as to be deadly, because that’s what it is: It’s deadly. When a child or anyone wants help, they should be able to get it now. That’s when you need it. That’s the other piece of the puzzle.", "Again, I cite the group of parents, Tragically NOHIP, who came here a few years back with their children and said, “Our children need help, and we’ve mortgaged our houses to get it for them” because they need to be in residential care for at least three months to get the help they need if they’re dealing with an addiction issue. So that’s another piece of it.", "Finally—I just have a few minutes left—I want to give a shout-out to Mark Baratta. Mark is this incredible person in Parkdale–High Park. He’s an addict himself. He walks around with a naloxone kit. He saves lives every week. There was a Star article about him, a beautiful one. We gave him an award at our volunteer banquet and, on the way to the banquet, he was late. Why? Because he saved a life. That’s how endemic it is in our communities.", "Please, yes, spend the money because that’s what’s being called for here: to do an educational program to reach kids and reach those who don’t know what they’re taking. And then, please, work with our federal cousins to get it out of the shadows, into the light, so that those people who don’t know what they’re taking can get it tested, can get some help. That’s what we need." ],

It’s an issue in every country around this world, opioid abuse by different ages, from young people to the elderly, men, women and children. It’s a major human problem around the world, in every country, every society and, indeed, in our society as well. When this thing happens, it’s not just only one individual who is affected by this very terrible issue. It affects families, friends, relatives and, of course, communities. It affects the whole population, so it’s a major issue.", "As the member who put this bill forward indicated, public education is very, very critical. Like any other issues we are facing in society, public education is at least one of the major key points in order to solve and tackle these kinds of issues. I’m glad this bill has been brought forward so that we can discuss how we can educate the public in order to tackle this social issue in our society.", "I’m glad that our government has come up with this opioid strategy in the province of Ontario, which our Minister of Health announced just last year. There are various elements to this strategy in terms of funding, which is the key. As the member from Parkdale–High Park indicated, it’s very key that the government allocate funding to solve or partly help solve this issue in our society.", "The strategy allocated $222 million over the next three years by our government, the government of Ontario, to assist people who have these kinds of problems. Now $9 million is going to go to add more front-line harm reduction outreach workers across the province. More than $20 million is there to expand the supply of naloxone, including expanding supply to at-risk individuals by distributing that particular medication through emergency departments. Then, $70 million will be invested to respond to needs at the community level for addiction treatment, including new rapid-access addiction medicine.", "There are many other allocations, like $23 million to provide additional support for existing harm reduction programs and so on.", "I urge all members to support this bill.

This is the second time our party has put forward a prevention tool and taken action to fight overdose deaths in Ontario.", "Just two weeks ago, my friend and Kitchener–Conestoga MPP Michael Harris debated his pill press bill to stop the production and proliferation of counterfeit opioids at the source. I was very pleased to support his efforts, and I’m pleased as well that his bill is now in committee.", "I truly hope the government will keep working together to ensure the pill press ban is quickly passed into law and will give law enforcement the tools to get these horrendous opioids like fentanyl off the street. With approximately two Ontarians dying every day from opioids in 2016, no one wants more families to suffer, so we need to work quickly to prevent future tragedies.", "Keeping our communities and Ontarians safe must be this government’s top priority in the fight against lethal opioids. But the fact is, this government hasn’t done enough. Drug overdoses have affected far too many families, because none of us is immune. From Ottawa to Toronto, London to Kitchener and even in my backyard of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, the opioid crisis has been hitting communities across the entire province for about a year.", "We believe the best approach to preventing future users is through greater awareness and better education, particularly targeting the youth in our province from taking potentially deadly drugs laced with fentanyl. This is something the government has the money to make happen. Given the government’s bulk media buy, or its advertising budget, which has grown in the last year from $25 million to $56 million, the government has the ability to dedicate 10% of that to the public fight against opioids. I sincerely hope they will show today that they also have the will to make it happen.", "Our caucus has urged the members opposite to do more in prevention of the opioid crisis. There have been about 20 questions asked in question period and two opioid-related bills put before the government.", "Opioid overdoses are preventable, and with more awareness and education, our youth will have a better understanding of just how lethal opioids like fentanyl and carfentanil are. They will know that just two milligrams of fentanyl is a lethal dose. Think of that, Madam Speaker—two milligrams could take your life away.", "We encourage the government to start advertising for public safety with the public purse. The government spent $5.7 million on ORPP ads after the program was scrapped and during the program’s scrapping; they’re slated to spend at least $5.5 million on their hydro scheme—all partisan vanity ads that the Auditor General has already criticized and suggested would not have been approved if she still had the authority the Liberals recently stripped from her. Surely they can find $5.6 million to be dedicated to bringing opioid awareness into every home, school and community in Ontario. This is, after all, a public safety campaign that could save lives. This is the type of thing we want the public to be aware of. This is where we think they should be putting their money and investing. The lives of our children, our pages, our grandchildren are the ones that we’re thinking of—and every life should be a priority.", "I know this is too late for at least one family in my riding. Sadly, my sons lost a friend to a fentanyl overdose. Again, it’s that Russian roulette, as the old saying goes. They really don’t know what they’re playing with. They don’t know how lethal that is. Just a little smidgen can snuff out that life in a very short period. But it’s not too late for the other 13 million Ontarians whose lives could be saved through this province-wide awareness campaign.", "Madam Speaker, I ask the Minister of Health and all of his Liberal colleagues to do the right thing. We have to always think of what our actions are going to be. Today we have the ability, through a private member’s bill, to make a difference in our community, which is why we all, of all stripes, come here—to make a difference, to be beacons of light for the next generation, for our current generation, for our seniors. At the end of the day, this is one of those ones—we see an epidemic that continues to grow.", "We know that there are needs are out there—and now it’s a call to action; it’s an ability to truly step up. In this case, we would support fully, and hope that the government will support, my colleague’s private member’s bill, Nick’s Law, to help us keep our kids, schools and communities safe from lethal opioids.", "When Michael Harris did his bill, there was a young lady—her name escapes me." ],

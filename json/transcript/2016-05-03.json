Our recommendation is that the government not move forward with this. We are not only going to oppose this bill as we move to a vote, but when we are elected in 2018, we will also repeal it and refund the money.", "That was a decision our leader, Patrick Brown, took when our party met in my city in March at our party convention to discuss policy. I think it was very popular among Progressive Conservatives, but I think it’s also popular among others. I believe that even the former Premier of Ontario’s son—Dalton McGuinty’s son—suggested that this wasn’t the right time to put forward something that could be considered a massive payroll tax in the province of Ontario.", "As I’ve sat in this Legislature for 10 years, which I was able to mark on May 1, I’ve seen this government bring in extraordinary tax hikes that have burdened the people of Nepean–Carleton and have burdened people across all of this province. I refer to this: The first bill I didn’t support and was able to vote against was the massive health tax that they brought onto this province. That was the largest income tax increase in Canadian history. They then brought in the single largest sales tax increase in Ontario history when they brought in the HST. They didn’t make it revenue-neutral, so they were taking in roughly $4 billion more per year than they had been previously. So the government, I think, put a burden on the people that way.", "We now see the way they’re bringing in their carbon pricing, or their carbon tax. It will be the single largest gas tax in Ontario’s history. Again, just like the HST and just like the health tax, this is simply going into general revenue. It won’t be going into environmental programs.", "That brings us now to this massive payroll tax, the single largest payroll tax that Ontario will be bringing in. There will be people in this province who will think they have security from this pension, but they really won’t, and it will be many years before those who are affected will have the opportunity to withdraw from it. I think it would be advantageous if the government took a more balanced approach and considered that the ORPP not undermine any existing plans or continue to disadvantage workers and investment.", "I think that if you look at this bill, there’s a very real risk that Ontario workers will end up being worse off if their employers with already attractive pension plans find themselves unable to continue those plans because they are required to be part of the ORPP. That, to me, says that not only is there a risk that workers will be disadvantaged, but I also believe it’s a job-killing payroll tax because we’re now putting an additional burden on employers. It will hinder the ability of the private sector to do what it does best; that is, provide jobs and opportunities for people who can strengthen our economy and attract investment.", "Unfortunately, we’re in a position, in the province of Ontario, where this government and its job-killing policies with respect to taxation have driven well over 300,000 manufacturing jobs out of the province, and I’m starting to recognize this. The reality of all your tax hikes that have fancy names and lofty goals is that the people of Nepean–Carleton are now seeing themselves coming to my office, looking for contacts to go to the food bank. I’ve seen a dramatic increase in Family Responsibility Office calls because parents are finding it harder to pay their support. When that happens and a single mother is unable to pay the hydro bill and is unable to pay the cable bill and is unable to pay the soccer bill, they’re coming to our office in more frequent numbers than they have in the past.", "I think it’s important that the government understand, when they put forward this pension investment plan, that it should be in the best interest and the highest return, free from political interference. I don’t sense that that’s what is happening with this ORPP. I actually feel—and I was a bit disappointed during the last federal election—that the government chose to run ads on this pension plan in order to intervene, I believe unfairly, with government money in the federal election with this pension plan. It became a strict debate between, on one hand, Premier Kathleen Wynne and, on the other, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper. I don’t think it was fair to the people of Ontario to be put in the middle of that fight, and I don’t think it was fair that the government used and abused tax dollars to fund those ads.", "When you look at their record of tax hikes, with the HST, the health tax, the carbon tax and now this job-killing payroll tax, and then you look at the waste and mismanagement, where that money is not going to its intended purposes, I think there’s a real concern here that the government is not going to invest this money in the way it is intended, and that the government is not going to ensure that the money that is accepted or taken from employers and employees will actually go to those employers and employees. What I’m trying to say here is that the lack of credibility from the government opposite on financial matters has a lot of people across the province very concerned that this will end up being another boondoggle, a scandal or another area where there will be waste and mismanagement with their precious tax dollars.", "I’d be remiss not to point out that it is getting tougher in Ontario. When you look at the hydro rate increase that happened on Sunday—it’s almost semi-annually that we know our hydro bills are going to go up, because the rates increase. The government likes to say, “You know what? That’s just a cup of coffee.” I’ve been here long enough to tell you, Speaker, on behalf of the people of Nepean–Carleton, that they can’t afford any more cups of coffee that they’re paying for but that were purchased by the government opposite. They can’t afford it. They can’t afford this ORPP and they don’t have trust in this government that they will be able to execute it appropriately. So I stand here before you today to encourage the government to rescind this bill, to talk to employers, to talk to workers and to ensure that if they move forward with any type of pension plan that it is in the best interests of the people that I represent in Nepean and Carleton.", "I’ll close on this: On Sunday, I made two announcements, one that I referenced in the beginning and another at the end of my speech. I announced I would be seeking the PC nomination in Nepean for 2018’s election. I live in Nepean, and my daughter goes to school in Nepean and plays hockey with the Nepean Wildcats; I’m very proud of that. I just want the folks in Carleton to know that I intend on being their MPP right up until 2018, and the people in 2018 will have me standing up against this rotten ORPP. I’ll continue to defend them as best as I possibly can.", "So thank you, Speaker, for the time I had, to be able to address all of those important matters." ],

They do not want a mandatory government program that takes their money away. They can’t afford it, and frankly, they believe that they can do a better job of saving and providing for their retirement than the government can. They have asked the government to cancel plans for this mandatory program.", "Not only have I heard this message at Tim Hortons and in phone calls and emails to my office, I’ve heard it through my business survey and my recent newsletter. In response to my annual business survey, 92% of the respondents said they would be negatively impacted by the mandatory pension plan, and 67% said the impact would be significant. They were clear that the cost of doing business in Ontario is the biggest challenge they face. In response to the survey, one of the businesses actually sent me a copy of a flyer they had received from an American municipality which was boasting about the low cost of doing business there and trying to convince him to move. He told me that he receives ads like that all the time. Those American jurisdictions know that we have been trying to tell this government that Ontario companies are struggling with the high cost of doing business here and the government keeps implementing policies that drive costs even higher.", "Our businesses are already dealing with spiralling costs of hydro, red tape, and high taxes. The mandatory pension plan would just make the problem worse. It will be a payroll tax, an extra cost that businesses have to pay for every single employee they hire. I’ve heard from businesses that this will force them to delay expansions or actually cut jobs. I received an email from a person in Ingersoll who said, “As a business operator, I certainly cannot even consider hiring staff due to this increase in payroll burden.” Through Facebook, I received a message from another constituent who said, “Add to this the provincial Liberal idea of the Ontario pension plan for our staff and we are seriously looking at eliminating staff.”", "It shouldn’t be a surprise to this government. Ministry of Finance documents actually predicted that there would be 50,000 job losses as a result of this pension—50,000, Mr. Speaker. Fifty thousand is more than the population of Woodstock, the biggest community in my riding. In fact, it would be equivalent to the entire population of Belleville or Welland. The chamber of commerce study shows that we won’t get those jobs back. Municipalities are working hard to attract investment and companies into their communities, and the government does this.", "The mayor of Welland told me about their innovative economic development program and how they are cutting red tape to make it easier for companies to locate there. How do we tell him that in spite of all his work, this government is pushing ahead with policies that will drive those companies away? How do we tell him the government knew that the pension plan would result in job losses but they decided to do it anyway?", "The Canadian Taxpayers Federation obtained a number of ministry documents through a freedom-of-information request, including research done for the government by a polling company. According to the taxpayers federation, that polling company found that 54% of businesses are considering a hiring freeze in response to the ORPP, and two thirds of businesses would make operating cuts. Large businesses are considering cancelling existing pension plans and layoffs. Small businesses will redefine employees from full-time to contract employees.", "They also found that 60% of businesses expect to be hurt by the ORPP. That means more layoffs in a province that has already been hit hard over the past three years as we’ve seen business after business move to more competitive jurisdictions.", "Mr. Speaker, unemployment can be devastating to a family. All of a sudden, people are forced to spend the money they have saved for retirement or go into debt just to pay the mortgage or rent and put food on the table. People who are laid off late in life may never financially recover.", "Shouldn’t we be focused on ensuring that there are opportunities for people, instead of forcing through a policy that will cost 50,000 more families their source of income? The best way to ensure that you can afford your retirement is to ensure that you have a job today. Instead, the government is pushing ahead with a policy that will cost jobs and take money out of people’s pockets.", "We are pleased that the government has delayed the implementation by a year, because we are hoping that is the first step in delaying it permanently.", "I also want to clear up some confusion for people at home. When many people hear “government pension program,” they assume that the government is contributing to the cost. So let’s be clear: The money for this program would be coming from employers and employees only. Each of them would be forced to contribute. This is money that employees are currently saving for retirement, or using to pay down their mortgage or, in some cases, using to try to make ends meet.", "I received an email from a constituent who said, “I am sending you this email because of my concern over the new proposal of an Ontario pension plan for employees that are not contributing to a pension plan at work.”", "He goes on to say, “My concern is that my employer offers a dollar-for-dollar RRSP contribution up to 5% of my income. If the Ontario pension plan is implemented at my work, they will remove the RRSP plan. The result of this would be that I will be able to put less money away for retirement, and get less money toward my retirement from my employer. There are many professionals in Ontario in the same situation as me.", "“My question is, does the government of Ontario plan to respect what these companies are currently doing and not implement a different plan when the employer is already doing more to help its employees to save for retirement?”", "Mr. Speaker, I think that’s a great question for the government today. In my last householder, I asked whether people supported a mandatory pension program and the overwhelming response was no. We have seen how this government manages their money.", "One constituent said, “Please do everything possible to avoid the provincial pension. We all have CPP and don’t want the extra expense of paying for a provincial pension too.”", "Under this government, many families don’t have money to spare. The cost of living is increasing rapidly, and life is already more difficult. For a person earning $45,000 a year, this will cost them about $800 a year. That’s significant. For a person earning $90,000 a year, the total cost to the employee and their employers will be—listen to this, Mr. Speaker—$3,286 a year. That’s a huge amount out of any family’s budget. That’s why our leader has committed that if we are elected in 2018, we will repeal the pension program and refund any money that has been collected.", "As a constituent wrote the other day, “Prices keep going up and we as seniors are finding life hard. We have even got part-time jobs.”", "Seniors on fixed incomes who thought they could afford to retire are struggling to pay their spiralling hydro bills. They’re seeing increasing costs for everything from driver’s licences to the cost of a glass of wine. This pension program will do nothing to help these seniors who are struggling with the increased cost of living under this government. It will do nothing to help the thousands of families waiting for social housing because they can’t afford a good place to live in Liberal Ontario. In fact, taking 4% off people’s paycheques will mean that many of these people who are barely getting by will now need assistance.", "Sometimes it seems that the government forgets where the money comes from. In this case, it comes from the families who are struggling to make ends meet and from businesses that would otherwise use it to grow and create jobs.", "The Ontario PC caucus believe that those people will do much better with the money than this government ever could, and that is why we would give it back to them. The Ontario PC caucus believes that people deserve the opportunity to have a job and that our businesses deserve an opportunity to succeed. That is why we oppose this job-killing payroll tax. I think that if they didn’t do this tax, it would make us all live better in this no-win Wynne Ontario." ],

That is a huge concern for not only employers but employees who are out there looking at saving their plans.", "The Cadillac of pension plans that we should be looking at, now that the Liberal government has their cousin at the federal level, would be an expansion of the CPP. That would be the opportune opportunity to get something done. We have it in place. We have a mechanism that is already there. People are accustomed to it. It wouldn’t mean reinventing the entire wheel. So I would encourage the government to look at doing that.", "As a candidate for the NDP, back in my first election in 2011, and in 2014, I actually knocked on doors, encouraging and asking people for their support, because of an idea that we thought of—of having a pension plan, and how many individuals across this province don’t have those pension plans, and how many of them are absolutely in need of a pension plan when they retire. Why? For dignity. Just the fact that they’re going to be struggling with the day-to-day expenses that are occurring right now—you look at the cost of everything: prescriptions are going up, hydro is going up, groceries are going up, rent is going up. Those individuals who are struggling today are going to need those tools in place and those extra funds later on.", "Mr. Speaker, I don’t know where you’re going to be 20 years from now, but I don’t think you’re going to be in that chair, and you’re definitely going to need a solid pension plan that we need to push forward so that individuals can retire with dignity.", "On a last note, Mr. Speaker—give me some leniency here—I just want to clear something up. I see the member from Nepean–Carleton. I am so happy that you’re going to be remaining with us. I just wanted to clarify: She is not going federally; she is going to remain provincially, in Nepean.

This is substantive work that is going to help generations of Ontarians with retirement income security.", "I have a very difficult time, to this day, understanding why the Progressive Conservative Party will stay in some sort of dinosaur age and not acknowledge that we need to ensure that people can save enough, that we need to make sure we find opportunities for young people who work hard to have good retirement income security. For them to continue to use mislabels like “taxes”—when did saving money become a tax? When did putting money aside that could be used in the future, money that will grow and will allow people to live with dignity—not only live with dignity, but reinvest in the communities they live in—become a tax?", "I think it’s highly irresponsible of the official opposition to use that kind of line and also to take the position that only the few who are rich in society should have the right to save money, and the rest, who live on modest incomes and work extremely hard, should not have that opportunity. We on this side reject that notion. We think that, as a government, we have an obligation to ensure that our young people who work hard have the opportunity to save money and are able to live with dignity.

If they have the luxury of having a job, you are actually taking 2% away from them. The employer is looking to say, “That’s going to be a burden on me.

Am I, in the type of work I’m doing, making any plans whatsoever to be able to retire?” Disturbingly, the answer to that question is no. Then you have to look at: “What is the Canada Pension Plan going to be able to contribute for me when I’m likely to retire?” The reality is that if you’re an Ontario worker, the chances are that the Canada Pension Plan will contribute less than $10,000 a year for you, and Old Age Security won’t contribute a great deal more than that.", "If you’re in the first third of your working life, you would have to look in the mirror and say, “Is it my desire to retire in poverty?” If the answer is no, then you’re going to ask, “What are my alternatives here?” At the moment, the only alternative on the table here is the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.", "I’ve listened to some people say, “Well, why don’t you just contribute to your RRSP?” Well, if that were the case, why are more than two thirds of Canadians not contributing to their RRSP?

How are we supposed to get by on a day-to-day basis, let alone have a further deduction from our paycheque to go into a Liberal pension scheme?” This is the reality in Ontario that this government is failing to recognize. It seems that they just go along and design these schemes, and they think they’re going to make the world just wonderful, but they don’t take into consideration the pain and harm they’re inflicting on people with their current policies.", "I mentioned this yesterday in question period, Speaker: I spoke to a lady on Sunday at a 50th anniversary, and she’s a volunteer at the Eganville food bank. She said, “John, can I see you for a second? I don’t know what you can do about this, but it is hurting people badly.” Usage at the food bank in Eganville was up 30%. They ran out of food; they ran out of things to give to people. They rely on donations and fundraising. They ran out because of the increase in clientele. Almost exclusively, when those people were asked what is bringing them to the food bank—“We’re at our wit’s end because of the continuous increases in hydro.” The cost of electricity is putting them into poverty, as my colleague from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock said. Hydro is putting people into poverty. It’s forcing them to go to the food bank.", "You have to ask yourself—anybody can ask themselves—how would you feel if you had to turn to a food bank? You question your own capabilities, your pride. Everything is damaged because you’re forced to go to a food bank. Why are they going to a food bank? Because of the hydroelectricity policies of this government.", "Now we’re taking all of that—a 418% increase in the cost of electricity since this government took office in 2003. If you look at the peak price, 18 cents a kilowatt hour—418%. Those young people—is there anything on the income side they can speak to that has gone up 418%? Only if you win the lottery. You’ve got a better chance of winning the lottery than having income security based on anything done by this government. I guarantee you that whatever money they think they’re going to put away in the pension plan, you’re going to be losing it tenfold in the increases in fees and taxes.", "What about driver’s licences? The driver’s licences, the licence of a car, it’s all gone up exponentially by this government. Every time you turn around, they’re putting their hands into your pockets and hurting you more. Now they’re saying, “We just need you to put a little more into a pension plan.” They don’t have the money. You’re crippling them and putting them into poverty. Stop helping. You’re putting them in the poorhouse." ],

Fawcett, who represented the riding and the people of Northumberland in this place from 1987 until 1995. Joan was born in Kingston. She went to Ottawa Teachers’ College and Queen’s University before serving her community as a teacher.", "Before becoming a teacher, though—and we’ve heard this a few times from former members of this House—Joan considered a higher calling. She considered becoming a nun. According to her son Tim, she considered Mother Teresa to be her idol—not a bad person to choose if you want a mentor.", "Joan met her husband and the love of her life, Bob, when she was teaching. He was the principal at the school. She and her family had deep ties to the Kingston community, but she ultimately settled on Northumberland as the place to make her home because it was a midway point between where she was from in Kingston, and Collingwood, where her husband, Bob, was from. Joan would go on to teach at Colborne Public School, home of the Big Apple—everybody sees it on the side of the 401 in eastern Ontario—while Bob taught in Cobourg at Cobourg District Collegiate Institute West.", "When asked what they most remembered about Joan and Bob, one of their friends fondly stated that no one could jive like these two when they got on a dance floor. As we know, in this game of politics, having fast feet can come in handy at times.", "Joan first entered politics on council for the village of Colborne, and she was the reeve of the village when she was elected MPP back in 1987. She first tried to win the seat in 1985 against Howard Sheppard, whom we honoured in this place just before Christmas last year. In a tribute to her positivity and her sense of fair play, Joan’s campaign against Howard wasn’t negative. As a matter of fact, she would tell people, “I don’t deny that Mr. Sheppard has been a good representative; I just think I can be a better one.”", "That positivity and fairness was something that she lived year after year in Colborne. Every summer, she committed to sending six or eight kids to camp out of her own pocket. She would regularly help students who needed things that their families might not be able to afford. She was a great constituency MPP.", "Both elections between the two in 1985 and 1987 were hard fought, with Joan winning the second one and joining David Peterson’s government in 1987 here at Queen’s Park. While here, she served as a deputy whip, she was chair of the Liberal rural caucus, and she was also assistant to the Minister of Skills Development at the time.", "While she was here, Joan championed a number of bills, but particularly was a supporting member of a bill put forward by our caucus member today, Ted Arnott, the member from Wellington–Halton Hills, that would allow volunteer firefighters to use flashing green lights on their personal vehicles when responding to a fire call. She had her own legislation passed as well regarding a special permit on the licences of our volunteer firefighters. Both members were working on that very important call, which is very important today in rural Ontario. As a matter of fact, it’s an issue that we’re still tackling here in the Legislature. Just a few weeks ago, the Minister of Transportation and I had a conversation about signs being put up on some of our rural highways leading to the 401. Folks in the Toronto area still don’t necessarily know what those green flashing lights are for. It’s because of the work of Joan Fawcett and our colleague Ted Arnott that there is a little bit more awareness of that issue today.", "After Premier Peterson was defeated in 1990, Joan was considered a possible successor at the time. But realizing the long hours that would be involved and the time it would take away from her beautiful family, who join us today, whom she loved more than anything, she decided not to join that race.", "Even after her final election in 1995, Joan stayed active in her community, including as the chair of the local United Way, which brought her back to where her political career started, before council, this time in Cramahe township in 1996.", "After retiring, Joan and Bob moved to a property that Joan had inherited on Howe Island in the Kingston area. Bob had previously made that land a Christmas tree farm—which I know would be near and dear to Jim Wilson’s heart; he has the Christmas tree bill, of course—in order to fund the education of his kids. That was the purpose of the Christmas tree farm: to educate his kids Tim, Andrew and Kristen, who join us here today.", "You know, there’s an old saying that we all know that goes, “Sometimes, it takes a village to raise a child.” But in an interview that he gave to Northumberland Today, her son Tim said, “Sometimes it takes a person to raise a village’s children.” That was something his mother certainly tried to do every day that she served the people of Northumberland.", "Today we honour someone who for eight years graced these halls here at Queen’s Park, but who for her entire life was the soul of generosity and a very, very special lady in Northumberland county. We thank her for her service." ],

The way we live, the way we serve should be able to provide a certain degree of insight into who we are, what we stand for and what we hold dear. It should tell you about what’s important to us and what we are willing to sacrifice for. No matter where you fall on the church-versus-state debate, it’s hard not to notice some of the similarities that draw people to commit their lives to service in either.", "At their finest, both institutions appeal to the best in us, tapping into a desire to leave the world a little better than when we found it. While both have shaped powerful movements that have changed the course of human history, it is the very real and tangible opportunity to positively impact the lives of those closest to us that gives each institution the strength to wield considerable influence.", "It’s clear that the intersection of Joan Fawcett’s faith and political beliefs motivated her towards a life of elected service. I never had the privilege of meeting Joan, but in preparing for this morning, it became very clear that she was equally motivated by two key principles: “Love your neighbour as yourself,” and “All politics is local.”", "Regardless of your system of belief or your political affiliation, that’s not bad advice for anyone with the goal of a career in public service. It’s clear that Joan was a woman who spoke volumes, often without saying a word. While she didn’t strike me as a firebrand, it’s obvious that she was no shrinking violet either. This wasn’t because she was shy or reluctant to speak up, but because she knew that what you did and how you did it was the most effective way to demonstrate your convictions. She understood that words were important, but meant little if you didn’t put in the effort to back them up. To her, politics wasn’t just a profession. She viewed it as a calling, something she was born to do.", "Today we often talk about the dearth of female representatives in public life. At the time Joan was at Queen’s Park, it would have been an even greater disparity, particularly as she balanced responsibilities of motherhood and family alongside her career as an MPP, with only 20 women of 130 members here in this chamber. That’s just 15% of the seats in this House. While history may not remember women like Joan Fawcett in the same way that it will the Rae Luckocks or Agnes Macphails of the world, it’s important to acknowledge that those of us who follow stand on the shoulders of brave women like Joan: those whose efforts call on us to do the same for the next generation of women who take up the challenge of public life, who seek to do the important work that Joan did.", "Today, we have the privilege of welcoming Joan’s family and friends to Queen’s Park. While there may only be one name on the ballot, all of us are familiar with the sacrifices that our loved ones make so that we can do what we do. While MPPs want their constituents and neighbours to remember them as effective representatives, there’s something extra-special when your loved ones acknowledge your time in office as time well spent. To all of you, thank you for sharing Joan with the people of Northumberland and the province of Ontario. On behalf of Andrea Horwath and Ontario’s New Democrats, we thank Joan for her exemplary service and commitment to the community she diligently served.", "May you rest in peace, Joan." ],

For the birthdays and special events that she may have missed, like some of us do around here from time to time, just know that she never took her family for granted. As many of the members here today that worked with her will tell you, she was doing work to provide a better Ontario that we all enjoy today.", "I know first-hand how difficult it is to try to balance public and private life, especially with a young family. Joan began her career as an educator, as you heard, in the early 1970s. She taught at Colborne Public School. She taught there for quite a number of years. Joan’s husband Bob was also a teacher, at the Cobourg West high school.", "The availability of a strong, provincially funded education system for all youth was important to Joan and her family. Around 1983 saw the beginning of Joan’s political career as she sat on council in the village of Colborne. As you have heard, to put it in perspective, that’s the home of the Big Apple.", "I had the pleasure of first meeting Joan while serving on the Brighton township council. We were municipal neighbours. Joan was, without a doubt, one of the sweetest, most caring people I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. A devoted and loving mother, wife and grandmother were her most valuable titles in life.", "In the words of one of her most admired heroes, Mother Teresa, “We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do.” “Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.”", "As a politician, I think we all have the best intentions to fulfill this with the constituents we meet and serve. However hard we try, we all know this isn’t always the case. Joan strived to model her life, as you heard, after Mother Teresa: always loving, always giving, and deeply caring for everyone she met.", "In 1985, Joan made a go at the provincial seat for Northumberland, but wasn’t successful against the incumbent, Howard Sheppard. As you know, we had a tribute to him just a few months back. Shep, as he was known in the community, was well regarded in the riding, and people would often tell Joan that to go against him, she was going to have a tough time. But as you heard, she always retorted that while he was a good representative, she could be much better.", "Joan was not happy with the then PC government’s treatment of municipalities in the education system. Always relentless in her endeavours, Joan took another shot at provincial politics and, in 1987, successfully ended the more-than-43-year Conservative reign in the riding of Northumberland.", "While in government, Joan served as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Skills Development, and as deputy government whip and chair of the rural caucus. During the brief term of the NDP government, Joan served in the official opposition as critic for seniors, disabilities and women’s issues. She also served as the Liberal caucus chair and as co-critic for agriculture and food.", "She was a member of many legislative committees, including the standing committees on public accounts, social development, resources development, and regulations and private bills. She was also appointed to the Select Committee on Constitutional Reform.", "A strong advocate for social justice and equality, Joan saw the need for and successfully lobbied the federal government at that time to support and grow the social housing programs in Northumberland county.", "Always a believer for volunteering within the community, Joan served with the United Way, the Catholic Women’s League and the Sweet Adelines.", "Joan was very aware of the importance of volunteers and how valuable a resource they are, especially in rural Ontario. She was also a strong advocate of volunteer firefighters. During Joan’s term on municipal council in the village of Colborne, she was appointed as council liaison to the fire department. In that capacity, she learned just how valuable this group of volunteers was and still is in its respective communities.", "Understanding the vital role they hold within rural communities, Joan introduced a private member’s bill in 1993 that would amend the Highway Traffic Act to provide a decal on the licence plates of volunteer firefighters, to make their vehicles identifiable while performing their emergency duties. This received unanimous support from all three parties and was passed by the Legislature.", "Discussion from this debate also sparked interest in using the flashing green light for volunteer firefighters responding to an emergency call.", "After her defeat in 1995, Joan decided to enjoy life and retire with her husband, Bob, in the Thousand Islands area, and spend their winters in Florida.", "It is Joan’s campaign team that I have to thank for being here today. Some of them, as you heard, join us here today in the members’ gallery and are part of my team right now that helped me: Darlene Warner, who works for my Brighton office; Diana Flesch, and Jim and Adria Williams. Without their hard work on behalf of Joan, which trained them really well, and approaching me to carry on her legacy in 2003, it’s entirely likely that I wouldn’t be here today, so thank you.", "My last opportunity to chat with Joan was about two months before she passed. We ran into each other at a year-end ceremony at Cobourg west collegiate high school. We had discussed getting together to catch up soon—she had just moved back into the area—but busyness got the best of both of us, and then it was too late.", "Speaker, Joan Fawcett’s years of hard work in this Legislature provided a better Ontario for all of us today.", "I’d like to close by thanking Joan for her service and commitment to her community.

It’s a role that comes with the responsibility to protect the public from individuals who have broken the law in sometimes heinous ways, and also the responsibility to help those same individuals through the rehabilitation process as they look to turn their lives around. It’s a dual role that few can be tasked with, but it is one that all rely on.", "In my role as the official opposition critic for community safety and correctional services, I have been able to meet with many officers who have shared similar concerns. The most common issue that has been brought to my attention is the lack of resources to do a job that they are passionate about—doing it effectively as well as safely. Offenders are becoming more violent and more complex to supervise. Officers are being asked to look after more and more clients without being provided a safer working environment.", "The minister spoke about body scanners at our detention centres, and it may be something to look into, to provide safer working conditions for our probation officers and parole officers who are sometimes faced with clients who bring in weapons and they’re unaware of that. Speaker, they need to be kept safe as well, and I know you’ll agree with me on that.", "If the province is unwilling to give them adequate resources to do their jobs properly as they face the highest caseloads in the country, or the resources to work safely as they continue to work without the basic protections, such as metal detectors, you would think that they would offer them help when things go wrong.", "Workers in many occupations face trauma at work; probation and parole officers are no different. We were very disappointed that the government left probation and parole officers, as well as bailiffs, off the list of first responders on the PTSD bill, but we will continue to call on the government to recognize these hard-working officers and give them the help they deserve.", "In addition to extending PTSD coverage to probation and parole officers, the government must also offer the proper resources so that their work is less traumatic to begin with. It’s not simply through a probation and parole officers’ day here in the comfort of the Legislature, but day to day in the workplace, where our collective support is truly needed." ],

I’m very pleased to add my voice and welcome our colleagues from corrections who are here, to recognize the work they do and to thank them very much for joining us today.", "This week is being recognized as corrections week, and today is probation and parole day. We also recognized First Responders Day on May 1, so I would like to echo some of the sentiments from May 1 and First Responders Day, because our correctional workers are first responders and high-stress, front-line service providers, and I want to fully recognize and thank them.", "We are safe and secure and go about our lives and go about our business. We tuck in our kids, we participate in our communities, and we make plans. We’re able to do that because our first responders work day in, day out to ensure that our society is safe, protected and secure.", "Our corrections workers are essential—maybe not officially; that’s coming. But the work they do is, and it is important to recognize it. The impossible decisions they have to make, the violent and traumatizing realities they’re faced with every day, and the truths that they know and the pain that they carry can never be measured. “Thank you” doesn’t seem like a sufficient way to express our appreciation.", "I’m glad to be able to comment on the corrections file. It’s a massive file, incidentally. In fact, Mr. Speaker, you might remember a time when it used to be its own portfolio, before it was tucked in and wrapped in with community safety, tucked in a back corner, locked away. Only recently has this Liberal government recognized that they have the key. Finally, there is more focus on the crisis in corrections. The public is paying more attention and having a better understanding of how corrections connects to all of our public systems, not just from what they learn on Netflix or in the movies, but they’re actually getting real information, which makes all the difference.", "I travelled around the province and visited 15 of our jails and about a dozen of our probation and parole offices. I saw dire need. I saw deplorable conditions. I saw first-hand what government neglect looks like. But I also saw commitment. I saw professionalism and corrections workers, officers and staff who work hard in dangerous, highly stressful environments. It isn’t enough to appreciate. We need to support when it comes to safety, when it comes to mental health, when it comes to training, protective equipment, staffing, and effective and appropriate policies and ministry practices.", "We know there’s a crisis in corrections. We’ve been calling on this government to address overcrowding and understaffing. I want to touch on that again. Our jails are terribly understaffed. Our probation and parole offices are struggling under immense caseloads. People living and working in our jails and working in the correctional system are asking for the same things, because basic, fundamental needs are not being met. The ministry is talking about hiring. Hiring is an important part of the story, but they need to be responsible employers and make sure that levels are appropriate. As officers retire, as they leave the job, levels have to be maintained to continue to meet the needs.", "Today is probation and parole day as well. Our probation and parole officers are high-stress service providers who keep track of all of our former offender-neighbours. They do their best to keep them out of trouble in our communities, with insufficient resources.", "We’ve talked about Bill 163 and presumptive coverage recognizing PTSD and those who have been diagnosed. We left out many of our front-line service providers. We left out our bailiffs. We left out our probation and parole officers. That needs to be fixed.", "I have so many thoughts and I’m running out of time.", "I will speak to the announcement today, because we need to focus on safety, fundamentally. I know that the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services would really like for me to send flowers and to thank the ministry for the body scanners. I’m not going to send flowers. However, what I will say is that since I’ve been elected, I actually haven’t seen a process like this one, where there have been health and safety concerns for years—because metal detectors aren’t enough—a pilot project, correctional officers have come to committee, letters to the minister. They’ve had that feedback. There have been regular reports of deaths and overdoses, slashings and stabbings. Staff and inmates are suffering the effects of a violent and unsafe workplace. For the minister to follow through on this commitment—I’ve actually never seen that before from this government, so I will acknowledge that." ],

Back in the mid-1990s there was a handful of them in Ontario. Now, if you look right across the country, there are hundreds. I believe that around 600 exist right across the country, and if you look throughout North America, they’re everywhere. In fact, Mr. Speaker, when I’m driving in Toronto I’m always shocked to see all these different payday advance places pop up in different parts of Toronto.", "I always notice that when you look at these places you see words like “fast” and “rapid” and “easy.” It’s almost like the money is free.

I know that if I did that with an e-transfer, if their card was working, it would have cost me a dollar or two.", "So there is a lot of change happening in Ontario and in Canada when it comes to financial institutions. This proposed legislation, Bill 156, the Alternative Financial Services Statute Law Amendment Act, 2015, amends three existing laws: the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act, the Consumer Protection Act and the Payday Loans Act.", "I’m really interested in these proposed changes, because I know there are many communities out there that find these types of financial institutions in their neighbourhood—we’ve seen banks move around, and sometimes they’re not in neighbourhoods where people live. These types of institutions affect some professionals, but mostly people who may have some financial literacy challenges. In some cases, they can target certain neighbourhoods; they can target certain people. I think it’s our job, as elected officials, to make sure we put in place the safeguards that will protect people.", "Mr. Speaker, could you imagine borrowing money and paying almost 600% annualized, over the course of a year? To me, it’s astonishing. When we look at small loans that you or I or many members of the Legislature or people in Ontario could go out and actually capture—can actually go out and get loans—they’re paying 3% to 5% on a personal loan and maybe 6% or 7% on a credit card; mortgages are at an all-time low at 2% or 3%. A credit card, which is considered the most extreme form of credit in some cases, is 20% or 21% at the higher end. I was reading a little earlier today that if you go and pawn something, it’s capped at 60%. But here we are in Ontario and Canada, where you look across the country and it is up to 600% that these payday loan operations can charge. To me, that is unacceptable, and we need to make some changes.", "That’s why we’re proposing this piece of legislation to make those changes. I know that it will give, if passed, the minister the ability to use regulation to put caps in place. There’s going to be a public consultation that will take place in order to figure out what the right type of number is.", "I’ve also noticed that we’re not the only jurisdiction that’s thinking about changes. I know that, in Alberta, there have been some changes. I know that there have been discussions even in municipalities here in Ontario. Ottawa currently has a discussion taking place on the licensing of these types of financial institutions. So it’s not only a conversation that’s taking place in Ontario; it’s a conversation that’s taking place throughout Canada and also in our local municipalities.", "Mr. Speaker, it’s our job to make sure that rules are put in place and that there’s a fair sense of equity when it comes to financial services here in Ontario. A piece that we need to constantly focus on—I’m from the literacy sector. That’s where I came from. I was the CEO and executive director of a literacy organization here in Ontario that specialized in digital literacy. I know that, working within that literacy sector, financial literacy was a key piece to literacy here in Ontario. We need to make sure that we continue to move in the right direction, that we invest in literacy and we invest in making sure that the right type of legislation is there and that the right type of regulation is there.", "I’m so happy to speak on this piece of legislation.

It is up to us to make sure they are protected.", "Across the province, there are more than 800 so-called fast-cash outlets, and their services are even available online. You know the ones, Mr. Speaker: the ones with the flashing neon signs that my colleague earlier mentioned; the ones that say “cash now” or “fast.”", "Our government knows that we need to monitor this industry and make sure people aren’t being taken advantage of. Why? Because people have expressed concerns. The high-interest loans and arrangements are often more than people can manage. So, after a lot of public consultation, we are proposing amendments that would put new rules and restrictions on payday lenders, rent-to-own outlets and collection agencies that buy debts and collect the money.", "When it comes to payday loans, we wanted to restrict high-frequency borrowing, which is why customers would now have to wait seven days between payday loans. Mr. Speaker, we know that high-frequency borrowing can sometimes result in financial disaster for some borrowers. These limits would give people more time to consider their options. Those who borrow repeatedly would have a longer repayment period in certain circumstances. This is about giving people a chance to repay their loans.", "Some may wonder why we don’t ban payday loans entirely, but our government has met with numerous consumer service agencies and they have specifically told us not to. Instead, these knowledgeable groups advised us that it is preferable to have a safe payday loan than no small-dollar credit at all, and that’s exactly what we’re doing with these amendments: making a safe payday loan system.", "The changes we’re proposing for rent-to-own services include giving consumers a grace period for late payment and a right to reinstate the agreement under certain circumstances. Consumers with debts in collections would benefit from rules that apply more broadly. This would include expanding the definition of a collection agency to include people who purchase debts in arrears and then collect them. That’s very important.", "Changes under the Consumer Protection Act would mean that cheque-cashing outlets that fall under the alternative financial services category would now have to disclose more information to consumers so that they know what they’re getting into. It would also give authority to cap the fees for cashing government-issued cheques, a very important step.", "Our government knows that alternative financial services can often be directed at low-income consumers or people who are in financially vulnerable situations. Ultimately, it can just push people further and further into debt, and we want to avoid that.", "We are committed to protecting consumers, and that includes preventing Ontarians from getting caught in a cycle of debt. This can mean financial ruin for so many people. By introducing these amendments, we can help to make sure that consumers using these services are aware of the costs, their options and their rights. We want to be sure we’re creating a fair and balanced marketplace for all Ontario consumers.", "Mr. Speaker, it is our aim to pass these amendments and have new regulations in place by 2017. I hope my colleagues in the Legislature will put their support behind Bill 156 and help to make sure that Ontario consumers are protected and safe." ],

Essentially, what they’re doing is—the sum of the changes is, first, to ensure that the person who is providing this credit is not taking undue advantage of the borrowers, who are often desperate. They’re desperate to cash that cheque to pay for their rent, to make that payment on the credit card. These are people who are typically in very difficult financial situations. They’re under a lot of stress, and they are not in a strong negotiating position. So they will often go to these places, and they will pay whatever price is being asked of them for that loan, for that short-term loan. One of the ways, I think, to protect them is to put some limits on the terms by which money can be lent to them.", "The second thing that this bill moves to do—and I think this is really critical—is around the idea of putting some responsibility on the lender in terms of who you lend to. One of the most interesting things, Mr. Speaker—and I think all of us probably have experienced this—is the fact that often, when I go and pick up my mail, like most of you—and I hardly ever get any personal mail. It’s always bills, a lot of bills, and some I guess what we call flyers or junk mail, and a lot of letters from banks offering me credit cards.", "We live in a world where credit is easily available, without any limitations. I, of course, like many of you, just tear it up right away. I take that credit card that comes in the mail—I never even applied for it and it shows up. Like many of you, I just cut it up and throw it away. But when you are in really difficult financial situations, you end up using that very high-cost credit.", "So the fact is that at least in the payday loan industry, we are moving forward to put some limitation and actually saying, “Listen, if this person is a repeat borrower, what are the checks and balances? What can we do to protect this person?” I really like that part of the bill as well. Actually, I want to go back to here: “Require payday lenders to take into account certain factors about a borrower before entering into a payday loan agreement, restrict high-frequency borrowing ... and improve payday loan borrower awareness of credit counselling services.”", "That’s the other piece that is really powerful about this bill. I think we can all agree that education is perhaps one of the biggest ways we can help people in any area, and that includes credit counselling.", "Often, when you’re under that kind of stress, you don’t have access to credit counselling that is in your best interests. Yes, there are people who will say, “We’ll consolidate your loan”—I was reading an article recently, I think in the Toronto Star, about this company that offered to help people who are in difficult situations by consolidating their loans, only for the poor customer to find out that you end up paying even more to the person who apparently was trying to help you. To be able to have access to credible credit counselling services is also key.", "The issue of, “Why don’t you just ban it? Why don’t you just throw the baby out with the bathwater?” I can tell you we did talk about it. The reason we decided not to ban it and instead to further regulate it is the fact that this industry exists because there’s a need for it. If we were to ban it, all we would do is push it underground. Having to choose between banning something and just pushing it underground, which would make it even more unregulated, we decided to take the judicious approach, the middle-of-the-path approach, which was, “We know there’s a need. We know that this need is being fulfilled by these payday loans or alternative financial services. What can we do to further regulate it?” That’s the spirit in which this bill is being brought forward.", "Often I find we have heated debates in the Legislature on proposals brought forward by the government, but I really hope that in this one case, we can all agree that the best way forward truly is not to ban this—because by banning it, all we would do is drive it underground, and the people who really, really are desperate for that liquidity would be denied that and then they would go in the underground or black market. Instead, how do we regulate it to find that balance between putting some more restrictions on the lender—but not so much that the business becomes untenable, because this is a service that people need—and that focus on education that would really, really help the industry and, in particular, those who are vulnerable?", "I think I only had four minutes.

This is, sadly, an expensive bridging solution. While I’m very supportive of the bill, and it’s an important next step, I’m hoping that our government doesn’t stop here. I think some of the user interest rates that people who are of very modest means or who are struggling, even after they get their first job and are back in the economy after they were pushed out of the economy, as so many people were in the horrible recession of 2008—these are the kinds of financial institutions and constructs that people perceive.", "I would much rather that one day, we start to deal with the issue of very high interest rates, whether it’s on credit cards or payday loans, because the level of return—when people are paying over 20% on money, you end up with all of your attempts to pay back being consumed. When you go to credit agencies for help, a lot of my constituents find that’s just another trap. Very smart, fast-talking people get you to sign papers that make it sound like you’re getting relief, but in fact, you’ve bought on to a whole other set of problems.", "I’m very pleased that this is moving forward, but I hope that this is the beginning of actions by this Legislature.", "I noticed some of the members opposite have raised these issues before, but I think this is an area in which all parties should be doing more.

So there was a 20-minute tag-team, divvied up four ways.", "I want to point out one thing to the Minister of the Environment. We’d all like to live in a world where this kind of access to money wasn’t necessary, we’d all like to have everybody never run into financial problems, but the reality is quite different. When the minister talks about this being something where people who are in poverty run to those places, that’s not quite the case. I used to think that myself, but we find that it might be people who actually work in this precinct; it could be people who are working in the broader public sector. They run into an unforeseen circumstance. I used to think that we should have gotten rid of these places, but then I got a little more educated about what actually happens.", "People run into an unforeseen circumstance—it’s unexpected. Somebody gets ill in the family, whatever, and then they get a hydro bill on which they have run behind. Then they have to make a choice between having the hydro cut off, which is going to cost more to get it reconnected, and running in for a quick loan, paying a higher service fee, but continuing with the hydro connection. They’ve actually saved more money than if they’d had the hydro shut off and had to pay a reconnection fee.", "There are all kinds of different circumstances that creep up when somebody is dealing with a payday loan service. It’s not simply the poor. It’s a lot of people who have regular jobs that are running these services. That’s why there are so many of them around. You can’t go down the street two blocks without running into a payday loan service." ],

One of the members of the United Way London and Middlesex sat on the expert panel that contributed to the legislation that we have before us today.", "Now, these issues are not new. They have been around for years. The government started the process back in 2013 of trying to impose some regulation and some protection for vulnerable people with legislation, and it has taken far too long to reach the point that we are at today. Of course, the bill that we see before us, like so many other pieces of legislation that are brought forward by the Liberals, contains very little detail. Much of the detail—much of the actual protections that will benefit consumers and those who have to access these predatory lenders—is going to be included in the regulations, not in the legislation itself.", "Certainly, we need these kinds of protections. Vulnerable people who are taken advantage of by predatory lenders need some real government action to protect their interests, but this bill needs a lot of work before it’s going to do that effectively." ],

That review was expanded, I think for all the right reasons, to include other types of high-cost alternative financial services, such as installment loans, cheque cashing and rent-to-own services, as well as debt collection.", "I think that, like everybody else, I’m certainly conscious of the fact that in each and every one of our communities, there are a number of these establishments that are there and that are to some degree meeting a need, but at the same time, I think, obviously putting people in very difficult positions in terms of what their actual rights are. That’s why I think this legislation is important.", "This proposed bill will protect consumers, there’s no doubt, in several important ways. Consumers with debts in collections would benefit from debt collection rules that apply more broadly, including applying to debt purchasers. Consumers cashing government cheques at alternative financial service providers would have more information and may benefit from a cap on the rate of cheque cashing services.", "I think one of the things that I’m keen on seeing, too, is that perhaps there will be limits governing what advertising signs can say, when they can say it, how big they can be and things like that.

First of all, it’s not very often that four people share one time slot. I quickly grabbed the bill to have a look at it because I thought, “This must be a massive bill and it must make massive changes to the payday loan situation in the province of Ontario.” But there really isn’t much in this bill that’s going to impact or help the situation.", "I think we all have to realize that what’s causing the need for the payday loan—and there is a need, obviously. That’s why there are more today than there used to be. It’s because it’s becoming more and more expensive to live in the province of Ontario. There’s usually a lot of the week left at the end of the paycheque and people have to find ways to pay their bills. I think it was mentioned by one of the other comments that when the hydro bill needs to be paid, the cost and the penalty for being two days late—just because it isn’t payday yet—is far greater than what they have to pay at the payday loan to borrow that money for that time. So there is a need for this type of establishment.", "At the same time, the government in their comments, as they were talking about this bill, didn’t talk about the real challenge there: Why there is such a growth in the need for having this emergency money available for the people of Ontario. Of course, it is because it’s more and more expensive every day to live in this province. The cost of hydro is now more than it was for hydro and food for that same period of time. I can go to the grocery store and get enough groceries for a whole month to feed the family. Then I get the hydro bill and, in fact, it’s higher than it is for all the food of that month. That’s why it’s getting more and more expensive to live.", "We have more and more people who need this service, and this bill doesn’t help that.

One, the inflation rate has been about as low as it possibly ever has been, historically, for one of the longest periods of time. We’re in an economy now where we’ve gained over 600,000 jobs, the majority of them at or above the median income. We actually have 8,000 fewer part-time jobs. Maybe that’s why we keep on getting elected.", "The other piece of this is that there are real structural problems in the economy. There are a number of more marginal people who are working multiple jobs and who have lower skills. Many of those part-time jobs are not being produced and the higher-paying, full-time jobs are harder to access, which is why we did things like free tuition for middle- and low-income people. There’s a skills gap. But there are very interesting studies that have come out recently on how much better the middle class is doing in Canada compared to the US. It’s an actual issue in the US election, Mr. Speaker.", "That being said, this is an option of last resort.

It is a last resort for consumers who have had bad credit or no credit and who all of a sudden face an unexpected expense or an unexpected drop in income. For so many ratepayers in my riding, including seniors on fixed incomes or small businesses who struggle to keep up with the rate increases to their hydro bills, they may have to resort to a payday loan. There are so many people who resort to using food banks—more and more, Mr. Speaker. It’s heartbreaking. Just when households and families think they’ve balanced their budgets for the month, they get the bill for their power usage and find out that electricity’s on-peak period has spiked or, just on May 1, another rate increase to their hydro bill. Even when they’ve conserved power, regardless of whether it has been a warmer-than-average winter, they’re penalized. So they’re penalized if they save, and they’re penalized if they pay. Something’s wrong with our energy sector.", "I digress, because we are debating Bill 156. But what I’m trying to say in this Legislature, so often, is that energy poverty is a serious issue and, regrettably, more and more people are in need of an extra loan. We’re seeing more and more payday loan facilities needed because of the way this government is running our province. Have we really come to a point where people have to choose between paying their bills and putting food on the table? Sadly, it is, Mr. Speaker. How can we possibly make people have to make such an impossible choice? People cannot pay their bills, and if they’re lucky enough to have a job, despite the rampant unemployment, they have to deal with rising energy bills and the cost of living, because everything under this government is becoming more and more unaffordable. People sometimes need a short-term loan. Payday lending is not meant to be a regular source of funding, but for those who do use it, we have to make sure that there’s continued access to this type of service, including the cashing of cheques.", "Bill 156 will allow the government to regulate the total fee charge for cashing a government cheque and mandate that the information be displayed where such service is offered. Regulated payday lending locations where cheque cashing is offered already provide consumers with ample information regarding the fee that they will be charged. The net result of the disclosure provision in the bill will likely be minimal.", "In fact, there was a report from the Royal Bank of Canada that said branches in Toronto would cash an Ontario Works cheque free of charge. This is the kind of partnership that the government should be promoting with the private sector across the province in order to give recipients of government cheques more options to keep all of their money, rather than seeing it chewed up by fees.", "Cashing a government of Canada cheque is already free of charge at any Canadian financial institution, regardless of whether the client has an account at the institution or not. However, in the 2006 Financial Consumer Agency of Canada survey, it said that only 22% of respondents even knew about this. The payday lending industry strives to work with the government to create a set of consistent and fair rules that protect consumers and allow the industry to thrive.", "My colleague Laurie Scott, from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock, recalls a meeting she had with her local credit union that covers quite a large part of eastern Ontario. Kawartha Credit Union serves 50,000 members through 25 branches, including seven where they’re the only financial institution in these small rural communities like Kinmount and Little Britain. Many of us in rural Ontario have the exact same thing, where there is only one institution of a financial nature in our small town.", "It is not only an important source of jobs, but the functions served are often rare to find in rural communities. I find that this government does not always consider the needs of rural and northern Ontario residents. This isn’t to say they’re completely neglected, although sometimes it certainly feels that way. But these bills, which are “consulted” with the public, are just not comprehensive or thorough.", "When we see this bill that proposes to do several things, like prohibiting lenders from opening another loan within a certain time of the last loan’s repayment, or allowing the minister to regulate payday lenders by capping the amount of money that can be borrowed, I think the government overlooks the financial limitations of so many people. It reflects just how out of touch they are with so many people.", "By introducing a mandatory extended payment period, the government is doing things wrong. The government is allowing a distressed borrower with clear, unresolved financial challenges to extend their payment period without providing any assurances that this particular course of action will make their financial situation any better. The government is increasing the chances of the loan never being repaid, as the borrower is likely to need another payday loan from another lender while the other is being repaid.", "Not everyone can find stable work or be in good standing to borrow money from their bank, even when it’s just a temporary crunch. This bill is simply about micromanaging the industry. For those who are fortunate enough to have full-time work, having credit—or rather, good credit—is an easy task. Most can prove a steady and reliable stream of income and solid payment history. But as I said before, this is not the case for every Ontarian. For new Canadians or those who have hit a bad string of luck, or had to suffer through hydro rate increases or missed payments, or experienced some negative credit circumstances, it is far more difficult to access extra funds.", "Rather than overhaul the Payday Loans Act, the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act and the Consumer Protection Act, the government should fix the fundamentals. The government should be looking at improving financial literacy among the consumer population. Consumers who frequently resort to payday loans should receive credit counselling. As our PC leader, Patrick Brown, has said, we should look at ways of improving reading, writing and arithmetic for our children—financial literacy, such as managing a credit card or filing income taxes or just understanding the basics of how to budget. Frankly, and I don’t say this to be smart, I think this Liberal government has something to learn about balancing budgets, seeing as they have doubled Ontario’s debt during their time in power.", "Most of our kids are going to need debt counselling because of the way this government is modeling how they continue to overspend and run roughshod with our finances in the province of Ontario. They have doubled our debt. We’re going to soon face $300 billion in debt, Mr. Speaker, and as you are well aware, even this year we’re going to spend $11.4 billion on interest payments at the lowest historical interest rates we’ve ever had in our province. That means $11.4 billion not going to things like health care, not going to things like education or to those on social services who need a hand up.", "My colleague Steve Clark, the MPP from Leeds–Grenville, said something quite poignant the other day, which is that the government chooses to legislate before they choose to educate. This bill is trying to micromanage the sector. Reducing consumers’ access to legal ways to a temporary loan without providing them with a clear path to financial sustainability will likely push them to the illegal loan market, and we all know that loansharking and those seedy practices are far more dangerous.", "Limiting access to payday loans does not solve the underlying problem. I’m sure this government can understand and appreciate what it is like to need a temporary cash injection. In fact, their sell-off of Hydro One is costing our province hundreds of millions in lost revenue and reaping billions, supposedly, for infrastructure. If they had a balanced budget, I trust they might not be going out to sell an asset such as Hydro One, especially when 85% of Ontarians are telling them it’s the wrong decision.", "But we all know it is a financing decision that this government chose to sell off a public asset, and with the sell-off comes a degree of flexibility in how the funds are being used. On top of that, the syndicate that profited from the sales is the same group that held a fundraising reception for the Liberal Party at $165,000. Talk about a double dip for this administration.", "As my colleague from Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry, Jim McDonell, has said, “Payday lending is the safety valve that stands between people’s legitimate need for cash and money management advice, and the unregulated, unscrupulous and unreliable underground debt market.” This bill is bad legislation. It absolutely refuses to tackle the cause of Ontarians’ financial distress while at the same time trying to pick out chicken bones in a bowl of soup.", "The government is equating payday loans with the problem. Resorting to payday lending is a symptom of an underlying financial condition. Whether it is due to the issues that I mentioned earlier or others, we should look at why people’s budgets are being stretched. No one, even on that side of the House, can refute that it’s more costly for every Ontarian in Ontario today.", "Most payday lenders will meet customers’ trust by offering extended payment periods when the customer indicates his or her economic situation is difficult. In those cases, the lender is happy to extend the payment deadline because they’re confident that the customer can meet the obligation.", "What the government is doing is creating a mandatory offer of a longer repayment period without any guarantees that the borrower can actually meet repayments. The end result could well be an increase in loan defaults and, therefore, a higher cost for everyone, including conscientious borrowers. If only the government would be conscientious about its borrowing, then we wouldn’t be billions of dollars in the red, taking money away from the services that we need.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m going to repeat again: This year, we’ll be spending $11.4 billion in interest—$11.4 billion that is not going to our much-needed health care, education and community social support services programs, among the other multitudes across here. That $11.4 billion is more than we actually spend on the whole sector of community and social services.", "This government is certainly faced with the repercussions of its poor fiscal management. The government is borrowing to no end, with no real, tangible plan to balance the budget except cutting services and selling Hydro One. Mr. Speaker, what happens next year after they’ve sold Hydro One? The Financial Accountability Officer has already stated that at the end of the day, this is not going to sustain them for the long term, that they will again have challenges balancing the budget after this one-time cash infusion of selling an asset that produces $750 million in net revenue every single year.", "People are hurting, and this government just doesn’t get it. Now the government will no longer provide intensive behavioural intervention therapy to children with autism aged five and older. More than 2,000 children with autism will no longer be eligible for this treatment, and families are scared and worried.", "It’s interesting, when we stand here in question period and we ask those questions, that the government doesn’t really come up with an answer of why they’re cutting something like autism services.

That’s an ugly truth that the government has chosen to ignore.", "So many people live paycheque to paycheque, and even then sometimes they have to deal with mounting costs like hydro, which I have said time and time again is just out of control. Consumers are expected to pay more and more because of the scandal, the waste, and the mismanagement of the 13-year tenure of this government. At the end of the day, we’re faced with things like this legislation among the added costs that we continue to bear on the front lines.", "Every day, I get people through my office, pleading with me to help them. “How do I pay my hydro bill? How do I make sure I get the services? How do I get my son or daughter to have that autism treatment?” It’s very challenging to say that there isn’t a lot of money in the cupboard. They are spending and overspending as a systematic way of doing their budget.", "Sometimes, Ontarians need to go on payment plans and change their payment plans. If consumers do not have a conventional financial product that suits their needs and they’re resorting to payday lending, is that not a reflection of the structures that have been put in place because of government policies? Currently, the payday lending industry is regulated through a maximum fee on a loan of no more than $21 per $100 borrowed. Although the fee would translate into a very high annual interest rate if a regular loan had the same terms, a payday loan is for a maximum of two weeks and the interest is never compounded. Ten per cent of payday loans have to be written off, which is a far higher proportion than regular credit-backed lending by banks.", "There is no credit check prior to receiving a payday loan. The only documentation needed is ID and recent pay stubs. This is in contrast to regular credit, where the decision to lend money and the rate at which it is lent depend on credit history. But as I mentioned earlier, not everyone is in an economic situation where they can have a solid credit history. They’re in a crunch. There’s an unexpected emergency, or, God forbid, they’ve actually got another hydro bill that they weren’t expecting to double or triple—very hard to budget.", "While banks are federally regulated and credit unions may choose that option under new federal rules, the Ontario government can still facilitate more Ontarians’ access to conventional finance by promoting bank account ownership and direct deposit.", "I do hope that the minister will be careful in drafting regulations under the fee cap provision. Whichever amount the ministry chooses as the fee cap, it must be significantly high enough to cover the inevitable losses from falsified cheques. If it doesn’t, we will experience what Quebec went through with payday loans: cheque-cashing services will vanish without there being any conventional financial service alternative available. Where will people turn?", "While there are many aspects to this bill, I do want to also touch on the amendments to the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act. The bill proposes to abolish the requirements for debt collectors to be registered under the act. It will also establish a framework for imposing administrative penalties on collectors not exceeding $10,000. Collections are where a company sells bad debt to a collector for pennies on the dollar and then they must recover those debts from the consumer. While there are currently legislatively coded restrictions on collectors and their practices, consumers are subject to high levels of stress. They often do not have the funds available to them and could potentially face the stigma of their debt situation becoming known.", "That is why I’m concerned that the government is proposing to remove the requirements for individual collectors to be registered with the ministry. Collectors must be registered, and any changes to their employment status with an agency must be notified to the registrar. No one can collect money in Ontario without that registration, and the registrar may deny an individual or agency registration based on that previous conduct. I don’t believe it is in the best interests of Ontarians to take out the provisions that will not allow any individual to carry out the business of collecting debts without first being registered in Ontario.", "As I wrap up my debate on this bill, I want to point out that the government has a public consultation process going on right now. They even had the gall to do a press release and say they wanted input on how much borrowers should pay for a payday loan in this province. Here’s the catch—the bill is in second reading. It has already been drafted. Sounds like the budget. We went out and did consultations and yet, a mere few weeks after we were presented with a budget in the House, they didn’t even have the committee meet to go over all the feedback that they supposedly had gone out and truly wanted to be accountable and transparent in their collection.", "Would this public input not have been more useful prior to the bill’s drafting? Now if the government does receive viable suggestions outside the scope of the bill, it is just too late. “Too bad,” the government basically says. “We know best.” The feedback will be open until May, but it seems asinine at this point.", "The government’s press release ends by saying, “Protecting Ontario’s consumers is part of the government’s economic plan to build Ontario up and deliver on its number one priority to grow the economy and create jobs.”", "In the 13 years this government has been in power, I have not seen that; in fact, quite the opposite. We’ve got to the point where people have become systemically dependent on social support services and financial assistance from paydays, and use food banks because life has become so expensive during this government’s time in power. The government should be creating conditions for growth and prosperity, not taxing Ontarians to death and then some.", "Specifically on the issue of this bill, we should look at addressing poor access to conventional credit, an issue that is so important for rural communities like Ontario’s north.", "I’ll summarize by saying it’s harder and harder for the average Ontarian to pay their bills, particularly their hydro bills. We need services like this for those people in short-term crunches who don’t have the ability to get conventional credit services.", "We need to ensure—particularly when this government will not listen and change tack on how they’re running our finances—that those people can actually access services when they need them, on their terms." ],

When I hear from people who are on ODSP and Ontario Works that those cheques—even if we put these measures in place to get them cashed without penalty, those cheques just don’t last the month.

Often, we turn to payday loan companies for a temporary reprieve, but it is well documented that current rules allow these companies to trap consumers in vicious debt cycles that force people to take out loans just to pay off other loans. All too often, people are working just to pay off the interest on these loans. It’s no secret that these companies are structured to make consumers dependent on the services that they provide.", "Now, this is able to occur for a number of reasons. For instance, many of these companies target Ontarians who are living on low incomes. These are people with unstable or precarious employment and who struggle to afford even the most basic services.", "In an article this past March, the Windsor Star outlined the scenario of a family whose hydro bill is in arrears, and the utility is threatening to disconnect their service. The article stated that if their hydro bill is $200, a 10-day payday loan in Ontario will cost the family $42. If they didn’t pay the bill and their hydro was disconnected, it will cost at least $95 just to have their services reconnected.", "It’s these situations that make people resort to using payday loan services, and I think it’s important to be mindful of the structural issues that drive people to do this. One of the first lessons that we can take from this scenario is that Ontarians are paying too much for even the most basic services like hydro.", "Last month, it was announced that hydro was going up once again, this time because of mild winter temperatures, meaning Ontarians used less energy than anticipated. Speaker, constituents in my riding saw right through the government’s flawed logic and misplaced priorities. Using less energy should result in savings, but, amazingly, the cost of hydro went up again on Monday, the third price increase since November. To say that my constituents and the vast majority of Ontarians are disappointed and angry would be an understatement.", "This will be the eighth year in a row that electricity rates are at least 9% higher than they were the previous year. A senior in my riding called my office and asked why he is being penalized for trying to conserve energy. Speaker, this gentleman was staying up past midnight just to do his laundry and spent many nights sitting in the dark just to find relief on his hydro bills. Government policies that lock us into paying an inflated price for energy drive people to resort to using payday loan services to pay for even the most basic services.", "Speaker, we also need to look at wages in Ontario. Here the issue is simple: The minimum wage in Ontario is too low, and it’s time for the government to listen to New Democrats and commit to a $15-an-hour minimum wage. Let’s be clear: This won’t abolish the use of payday loan services overnight, but it’s the first step in empowering hard-working Ontarians with a wage that makes life more affordable. If we can do this, if we can empower Ontarians with the tools that will make payday loan companies less attractive, we can break the borrowing cycle that sees too many Ontario families indebted to these institutions.", "The legislation before us today can help with this. Overall, I think the bill has good intentions that can offer consumers protection and relief from predatory lending practices and exorbitant fees. Bill 156 amends three acts: the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act, the Consumer Protection Act, and the Payday Loans Act. I’ll draw attention to the more notable amendments. Amendments include expanding the exemptions relating to the act, introducing an administrative monetary penalty regime, and moving the collector licensing regime.", "Some provisions of this legislation include placing limits on the fee that may be charged for cashing a government cheque. These regulations are yet to be announced, but may include:", "(1) a fixed amount;", "(2) a percentage of the face value of the cheque or any other amount calculated on the basis of the face value of the cheque;", "(3) an amount that results from the combination of (1) and (2); or", "(4) any amount determined by any other prescribed means.", "The bill also allows the government to redefine the number of days the loan broker must wait since the borrower has paid the full outstanding balance under the first agreement before facilitating more than one payday loan between the same borrower and different lenders.", "It permits the minister to make regulations that prohibit a lender from entering into more than the prescribed number of payday loan agreements with the same borrower in a one-year period; prohibit a loan broker from facilitating more than the prescribed number of payday loan agreements between the same borrower and different lenders in a one-year period; and prohibit licensees from offering or providing prescribed goods or services other than payday loans to anyone. It’s unclear what these goods or services will be; they could be gift cards, for example.", "The provisions I just outlined are well-intentioned, but good intentions alone won’t protect Ontarians from predatory lending fees or help families get out of debt. While this legislation sets up a framework to help Ontarians, it does not compel the government to act in any meaningful way. Instead, we are supposed to trust this government to implement regulations at a later date.", "Well, Ontario families are right to be skeptical. This bill was an opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of Ontarians who are having a hard time making ends meet. Unfortunately, this bill is another opportunity missed for the Liberals.", "The concerns that Bill 156 are supposed to address have been around for years. The government started its review process back in 2013 and continues to stall in making any real progress on this file. The time for action is now. Once again, the Liberal government has managed to avoid accountability, particularly to those thousands of Ontarians who find themselves in financially precarious circumstances. Ontarians deserve a government that will stand up for them and will offer consumers real protection and relief, not one that continues to find ways of doing just the bare minimum.", "For years, New Democrats have called for real action to protect consumers and help make life more affordable for Ontarians. In December 2014, the NDP consumer services critic and deputy leader, MPP Jagmeet Singh, introduced a motion in the House that would cap lending fees to $15 per $100; extend the grace period consumers have to pay back their loans without penalty; create a database to enforce the ban on rollover loans; and ensure the government works with financial institutions to provide alternative services, like credit unions and postal banking, in low-income communities.", "With the exception of extending the grace period, none of the other provisions are addressed in this bill. New Democrats will keep fighting for real change in Ontario.", "Speaker, I’d like to thank you for the time today. I look forward to continuing debate on this legislation. I’d like to close by reminding the government that my constituents can’t wait for real action on these issues—I cannot stress that enough—particularly the constituents of Windsor West.

Many of my constituents live on ODSP or OW. They’re on social assistance. There are seniors who are on fixed incomes. We see homeless people who are struggling financially. They’re living in homeless shelters or out on the street and they’re using what little money they can to try to find work or to try to feed themselves—because we’re also finding that the food banks within Windsor and Essex county are struggling.", "More and more people are struggling financially, especially now that the cost of hydro has gone up. Those people who would normally buy a little bit extra when they’re at the grocery store and donate it to the food banks or donate it to the Windsor Youth Centre, which helps homeless and at-risk teens and provides them with meals during the day or sends them home with some groceries or gives them money to be able to get on a bus and for lunch, or gives them a lunch to eat—these community organizations themselves are now starting to struggle because the people in my community do not have the funds available in order to be able to help these organizations.", "We need this government to commit to fixing what’s wrong with payday loans. We need them to commit to really taking action on this, not commit to committing again to take action. We actually need them to take action. Words are not enough anymore.

If I can, Mr. Speaker, for a second, the amendments are going to focus on disclosures and reducing the likelihood of consumers entering into repeat borrowing, because the government heard from users across the province and from those who work in the industry that this is a concern.

If people could afford to pay their hydro bill and not have to decide between the hydro bill and food or the hydro bill and dressing their children before they send them off to school hungry in most cases—if we didn’t see ridings like the northern ridings, where in some cases they’re paying nearly 30 cents a litre more for gasoline, ridings where there’s more ground to cover as opposed to in my riding, where everything is very close by. It’s very urban and everything is very close by. In the north, they have a lot of driving to do in some cases to get to where they need to go. That’s predatory, to charge them more for gas, knowing that they have to travel further to get where they’re going to go. That hurts the bottom line when it comes to their household income. I think if the government was to address some of those issues, we would see fewer and fewer people going to payday loan lenders.", "Certainly for those people who do need to access these services, and until the government fixes those problems, we need to see concrete action taken by the government to actually stop the predatory practices of these payday loans. We don’t need to hear about it anymore. We need to see action, and we actually want them in committee to listen to some of the recommendations coming from all sides." ],

The economy, the world, works on financing and financiers and extending payments so that you can make big projects and stuff like that. I remember my father talking to me once about borrowing money and that, and never once in his life did he borrow money. Not once in his entire life did he personally borrow money. In business, as it evolved, we had a line of credit at the bank, so if you had a big shipment come in and you didn’t have quite enough in the current account—that type of thing—you’d have some coverage that way.

I had an opinion of them years ago: I thought that, really, they were a bunch of shysters that were just looking to take advantage of the vulnerable. But then we start to realize and learn about who the clientele are. Part of it is, I say, about this attitude we have in society: People actually have good, solid incomes and steady jobs, but they’re always just right on the edge because they’re living a lifestyle where every dollar is spoken for. Every dollar is spoken for, and the banks are as guilty as anybody; they’re just dying to give you money—dying to give you money.", "You know, again, I shouldn’t be talking too much personal stuff but, a couple of years ago my son, who didn’t even have a job—he was finished with post-secondary but he didn’t have a steady job yet. He didn’t even tell me, because he was driving a car of mine for years, but he just went down to Belleville one Saturday, or some Friday afternoon or whatever the heck it was, and came home with a brand new car.

If we have that kind of change in our society, then we also have a responsibility to educate the young people of today about financial literacy, so that they don’t find themselves in a financial bind a few years down the road. We have that responsibility, and I don’t think we’re doing a very good job of it.

This curriculum allows students as young as 11 to understand financial mathematics by calculating interest, and by 14 they will learn more about sophisticated financial products and services.", "“This system would be very beneficial for Canadians as the next generation would have a better idea of how to use their money wisely, and less people would be living in debt. I graduated high school in 2013 and did not have any appreciation for money. Not until I spent all of the loans given to me through OSAP and came home to live with my parents once again did I appreciate what debt truly means. Almost everyone I know in their twenties spend money recklessly because a lot of people do not appreciate the cost of living and rely heavily on loans.”", "This is the political reality in many ridings.

They can either panic right out and say, “How am I ever going to pay back my student loan?” or forget about it and continue on this path that, “Loans don’t matter. I will live my life and pretend that this humongous anchor is not attached to me and continue to borrow like a drunken sailor,” as some of them would say.", "I would say financial literacy would go a long way towards changing all this, making them realize that yes, getting an education is important but managing your debt is also important.

Basically, Speaker, what the bill is meant to do is strengthen protection for consumers who use what we call alternative financial services. Right now, if you look at where most people do their financing, it’s either at a bank, at a credit union or at a caisse populaire. Those have sets of regulations under which they do their business that protect consumers, but for a multitude of reasons—and some of my colleagues have covered some, and I will cover some of my own—a lot of people are not able to deal with a caisse populaire or the credit union or the bank, so they end up in what is called alternative financing services, which is what most of us call payday loans.", "So given that they are outside of the credit unions, the banks, the caisses populaires, they really have very little regulation about them, and we have seen that the practices that they use tend to be very predatory. They really target people of low income or people who find themselves in a financial crisis in their lives, often for a reason that has nothing to do with bad credit or bad management or bad financing. It’s simply because of bad luck within their lives.", "I represent a riding in northern Ontario called Nickel Belt that is made up of 33 little communities. None of them are big enough to be called a city or to have municipal councillors or anything of the sort. They are local services boards, they are unincorporated areas. Most of them tend to be small, although altogether, they make up close to 90,000 people. They live in smaller communities. For the life of me, I can’t understand why it is that in most of those communities, we are not able to get a pharmacy to stay in there; we are not able to recruit a physician or a nurse practitioner to come and provide services; we are not able to bring a school, because most of them have been closed and the kids get bused out. A lot of them don’t even have a restaurant or a grocery store or many of the other services that we find, but a lot of them have payday loans. How can it be that, apparently, the community is too small to support a restaurant, too small to support a grocery store, too small to support a school or a pharmacy or a physician, or anything else, but it is big enough to support a payday loan operator?", "The health unit does a very good job of looking at the social determinants of health within the health unit, the Sudbury and District Health Unit area. They cover a good part of my riding and they map out where the areas of poverty are. So you can put out this map and look at where the areas of poverty are. The map is colour-coded so you see that in some parts of my riding, there are really deep pockets of poverty. It’s funny, Speaker, because those tend to also be the places where the payday lender decides to open up shop. I don’t like that; I don’t like that a bit. Why is it that some of them get a government cheque in writing, an actual cheque, not a big amount—they are hundreds of dollars, sometimes less than a hundred dollars. Everybody knows that the government is going to be good for that cheque. The government is going to give you the money. They’re not going to default on the cheque. They’re not going to pack up and leave or anything like that. But yet, to go and cash such a cheque at the payday loan, because the payday loan is the only show in town, you will pay; 15%, 18%, 20% of the value of the cheque will be racked up by those businesses. And yet, here we stand.", "I was there in 2008, Speaker. I was there when the first bill was brought forward to regulate payday loans. We knew of those practices back then, but we missed the boat. And here we have a bill that is full of good intentions. The bill is just that: It is a wish list of good intentions that the government plans to address. But none of that is in the bill. The bill just tells us that they plan to address this in regulations that will come at a date yet to be announced, in a form that none of us have had an opportunity to read and that only the government will control.", "I say to that, Speaker, that I see good intentions. When you read the bill, you see everything that they have the intention of doing, and I recognize a good intention when I see it. They have the good intention of protecting consumers, but unfortunately, it falls short. Good intentions and actions are two completely different things. Good intentions do not protect anybody. Good intentions do not stop the behaviour of people who have made it their business to prey upon the poor and the needy, or the people who unfortunately have had bad luck in their lives and have had to turn themselves towards borrowing money from them.", "So I would urge the government to really look at the bill, to listen to the suggestions that we are making. Certainly, our colleague from Bramalea–Gore–Malton—sorry about that; I didn’t spit that out as neatly as I would have liked—has put a number of those suggestions on the docket. In 2014, he put forward that we should cap lending fees at $15 per $100 that you borrow; extend the grace period that consumers have to pay back their loans without penalty; create a database to enforce the ban on rollover loans—a rollover loan means that you borrow money to pay another loan, and you keep doing that, sinking yourself deeper and deeper into a hole where you will never see the light of day again; and ensure the government works with financial institutions to provide alternative services, like credit unions and postal banking, in low-income communities.", "I must say that I have a fantastic network of credit unions in my riding, and I also have a fantastic network of caisses populaires, which really try to go into areas where the banks won’t go, in areas where people basically need them. But they also need to have the tools in order to be able to do that.", "Ça me fait toujours plaisir de participer aux débats sur les différents projets de loi qui sont présentés.

The world changes so fast that it allows government to tweak regulations faster to meet the changes than to go back and create new legislation.", "With that said, I just wanted to touch on a couple of the key things that are near and dear to what I’ve heard across Ontario. One of them is: Really, what will this bill do? What problem will the bill solve? We know that some alternative financial services are often targeted at consumers with limited financial resources or in a financially vulnerable situation. We heard of a number of such situations occurring around that today. Our government wants to ensure that consumers using these services are aware of the costs, aware of their options and aware of their rights. That is so important.", "Just a brief word about alternative financial services, because I heard a comment about the cost of cashing government-issued cheques: That is part of this, and that will be addressed as we move forward.

I know we have this bill put in front in order to deal with people with hardship who are having to cash a cheque because they’re unable to make it to payday without having to cash a cheque early, but financial literacy in our school system, I think, would start to alleviate this problem down the road.", "Other than getting the government’s finances in order—I think that has been talked about enough on this side today—I think of the aspect of financial literacy. I remember that when I graduated university, my brother gave me the book The Wealthy Barber, which is a neat book to read. It talked about paying yourself first and preparing for the future. I think maybe that type of book—I don’t, as I say, promote The Wealthy Barber, but I think it’s a great book—should be studied in high school, so that by the time our children get through university—they’ll be in debt quite heavily because that’s what’s happening nowadays with kids, but they’re able to deal with that situation and plan and finance their lives down the road. That will deal with something down the future. I hope this government takes the time and institutes financial literacy into our school system.", "I’m hoping that when this bill gets through, there’s some sort of balance. In my city of St. Thomas, where I’m from, these payday loan sites have just blossomed. It used to be that downtown St. Thomas was full of storefronts and shopping, and now we have a lot of payday loans.

Ils veulent avoir l’opportunité d’être capables de se planter devant une caméra et de dire : « Regardez, comme gouvernement, comment on est bien et comment on est bon. » Mais quand tu regardes à l’intérieur du projet de loi, il n’y a pas vraiment gros là pour être capable de dire que ce monde qui utilise ces emprunts instantanés va être protégé d’une manière ou d’une autre. Ils vont encore payer des gros intérêts et ils vont encore avoir des pénalités telles qu’on en voit présentement dans ces emprunts-là. Comment est-ce que ça aide le monde qui a besoin d’utiliser de l’argent de ces institutions-là parce qu’ils n’ont pas de carte de crédit ou que la carte de crédit est finie; qu’ils n’ont plus accès aux banques pour être capables d’emprunter de l’argent; ou qu’ils ne peuvent pas aller à la caisse populaire, au « credit union »? Ils en sont rendus au point où c’est le seul mécanisme qu’ils ont pour être capables d’emprunter.", "Si on va avoir ces institutions-là, je comprends qu’elles ont besoin d’être capables de faire un petit profit, mais ce doit être un petit profit qui n’est pas sur le dos des plus diminués dans notre société qui se trouvent dans une situation précaire et qui ont besoin d’aller à ces institutions-là qui en prennent avantage. Le gouvernement peut se péter les bretelles tant qu’il le veut, mais à la fin de la journée il n’y pas grand-chose dans ce projet de loi pour être capable d’être bien content." ],

Given the area, yes, you would find this type of business established in those areas and indeed preying on the local communities. But I have to say that her community is not the only one.", "I have pockets my area where banks have moved away. We have no caisses populaires, no credit unions and no other banks. Unfortunately, these people now are so popular with this type of banking, if you will, or payday loans or shops that they are competing among themselves. They have become so popular now that they are competing among themselves.", "Unfortunately, yes, there are too many factors. Education is a very important one for the young and for the old. Habits are very important. Life is full of temptation, especially when it comes to money. I don’t have to tell you, I’m sure, that you have a community where you witness some situation where people spend money without thinking about it. They want to go on a vacation—a “fly today, pay tomorrow” kind of a thing.", "It’s important. The legislation that is in front of us doesn’t deal with banks or credit unions; it deals with the payday shops, the ones people can go in and out of and borrow a few hundred dollars. They’re being penalized so heavily that then they fall behind and they even get worse, and they go back and get more penalized. I think we want to make it easier and better for not only for the customers but for the payday loan shop as well, that there is more control. This is all on behalf of the people that we represent." ],

Where we fall apart is on what kind of regulation we should put forward. I would say that we are pretty much aligned when it comes to the vision as to where we want to get to. Where we’re not quite as aligned is that we on the NDP side want to see it in legislation. We want to see that the way that the industry will be regulated will be in legislation: things such as capped lending fees at $15 per $100 borrowed; things like extending the grace periods that consumers have to pay back their loan without penalty; things like creating a database to enforce the ban on rollover loans; and things like ensuring that the government works with financial institutions to provide alternative services—like credit unions, caisses populaires, postal banking etc.—in low-income communities. We want to see this in legislation. Where the bill falls short is that it talks about all of this—it talks about the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act; it talks about the Consumer Protection Act; it talks about the Payday Loans Act—and it says what it will do at a later time.", "Let’s work in the present. Let’s bring forward a piece of legislation we can all be proud of, that will get results, and bring it now." ],

  "text" : [ "I want to thank the Conservative House leader for agreeing to stay and listen to what I have to say.", "The other day in the House, on Monday, I believe, I got up and asked what I thought was a very simple question. The price of gas a couple of weeks ago in Ontario—there was almost a 25-cent-a-litre difference between southern and northern Ontario. Nobody’s going to make me believe, or make anybody else believe in this province, that there could be a 25-cent-a-litre difference in gas across this province. When you can take a case of beer and sell it in Cornwall for the very same price you sell it in Kenora—certainly if we can sell beer at the same price, we should be able to sell gas at a similar price.", "Instead, what we’ve got is the refiners in this province—I shouldn’t even say in this province; the refiners in this country—who essentially band together and decide that they’re going to set the price, depending on your market, higher than another area.", "So I’ve ask the government a very simple thing: Back in the 1970s, Stephen Lewis was the head of the New Democratic Party of Ontario and Mr. Davis was Premier of Ontario. At the time, we were going through the same thing. You’ll remember that awful gas price crisis that was going on at the time, where the price of gas was going through the roof. There were these gas differentials going across the province that were equally as bad, but to a different magnitude. But at the time, Stephen Lewis, the leader of the New Democratic Party, got up in the House and said, “Listen, you have the authority to regulate the price of gas. You may not have to do so, but what you at least should do as Premier is call in the gas companies, the refiners and say, ‘Either you get yourselves under control, when it comes to the price of gas and the differentials from one part of the province to the other, or else we’re going to do it for you by way of regulation.’”", "The industry understood that because the Premier had called people into his office in the Legislature to have this discussion. They didn’t want to get regulated, and they went out and fixed the problem. For years, there was always a bit of a differential, but it was not what we’re seeing today.", "Today, I decided, for the point of this question, to look at the price of gas in Ontario. Today, from what I saw, you’ll pay 94 cents in Alliston, you’ll pay 93 cents in Windsor, but you’re paying $1.10 in Timmins—and I haven’t looked at Kapuskasing and every other point north. There’s a 15-cent-a-litre difference today in the price of gas in this province when there shouldn’t be. You’re not going to tell me it costs 15 cents a litre to transport gas that’s coming from Alberta to southern Ontario—it has to come through northern Ontario to get to southern Ontario—and we’re going to have to pay more for the price of gas.", "I said to the government across the way, “Will you, as the Minister of Transportation, call these people in and tell them to get themselves under control or else you’re prepared to regulate?” What did I get? The Minister of Transportation said, “Let me talk about all the great things we’re doing in northern Ontario,” and went on to list some of the things he thought were great. I responded and said, “Listen, you’re the guys who took the train out of northern Ontario. You’re the guys who jacked up the price of hydro in northern Ontario. You’re the guys who cut the buses in northern Ontario. You’re the guys who essentially drove Xstrata’s Timmins refinery/smelter out of the province of Ontario into Quebec because of the high price of gas.” I said, “Is this comedy hour or is this question period?”", "On the supplementary, I got to ask the question again, but this time it was referred off to the Minister of Energy—and this is the reason for my late show. I said to the Minister of Energy, “Minister, are you prepared to call in the gas companies, the refiners, and tell them to get themselves under control or else you, as the Minister of Energy, through the Ontario Energy Board, are going to put these people in their place?” What did he answer? “It’s a federal responsibility.” Excuse me? A federal responsibility?", "There are five provinces in Canada that have decided to do various types of regulation on gas prices. Some are better than others. The province of Quebec has probably the more expensive of the systems of regulation. Today, when I looked at the price of gas in the province of Quebec, it was running about $1.03. But here’s the interesting part: If you’re in Montreal, it’s $1.04; if you’re in Rouyn-Noranda, in northern Quebec, you’re paying $1.03.", "If you’re in southern Ontario, you’re paying 94 cents; if you’re in northern Ontario, you’re paying $1.10. There’s a 15-cent-a-litre difference in the province of Ontario, north to south, where there doesn’t have to be one. If you look at the model in New Brunswick, across the province they’re paying 95 cents. So clearly there are models of regulation out there that Ontario can learn from that would allow us to set the price of gas so that refiners and gas stations can make a profit, but it wouldn’t be on the backs of the consumers of Ontario to have to pay more for the commodity than we presently do." ],

As the member should be well aware, gas prices are variable. This means that everything from weather to local supply and demand to global market crises can all affect the overall price of gasoline.", "While we’re talking about the differences in gas prices between northern and southern Ontario, we need to look at a number of factors. Whether it’s lower volumes per outlet—which increases the cost per litre of gas—higher wholesale and retail costs, the fact that northern distribution terminals are located farther away from refining centres, or that gasoline often requires transportation by rail or truck rather than pipelines in the north, these factors can all have a very direct effect on local gasoline prices.", "Now, the NDP is fond of suggesting that regulating Ontario’s gas prices will help prevent these kinds of fluctuations. In fact, provinces that have regulated prices historically tend to have comparable or even higher prices than Ontario. And as I said earlier, their prices are also affected by global factors outside of provincial control, proving that regulation does not necessarily protect consumers from rising prices.", "I want to emphasize here that Ontario’s competitive gasoline market as a whole is functioning quite well. In Ontario, we’re lucky that consumers can benefit from a competitive market, which is not the case in provinces with minimum retail margins. As always, our government continues to regularly monitor gasoline supply and prices on an ongoing basis to ensure that this system is working for all Ontarians.", "However, since the third party is giving me the opportunity to respond tonight, I think it’s important that I take the time to talk about how our government has continued to be a strong champion for northern Ontario. Thanks to the advocacy of our members, whether it’s the member for Sault Ste. Marie, Thunder Bay–Atikokan, Thunder Bay–Superior North or Sudbury, the north continues to be very well represented at Queen’s Park.", "As a government, we wholeheartedly appreciate how unique the north is as a region. That is why we continue to make record investments in northern Ontario. It is, after all, our government that’s created more than 27,500 quality jobs in the north. It’s our government that has supported over 7,000 projects through a $1.1-billion investment in the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corp. In addition, we’ve invested $25 billion into provincial highways since 2003. That includes $550 million committed this year alone in northern repair and expansion projects.", "I know that there was great excitement in northeastern Ontario in January 2016. The investment that I’ll be talking about is in an area I know well. I visit Grundy provincial park every summer to camp with my family in the Key River and French River area.", "In January, the transportation minister announced $173 million, which is actually the largest investment by MTO, to continue the four-laning of Highway 69 between Sudbury and Parry Sound, the area between Key River and French River. What they’re looking at is an additional 15 kilometres of four-laning. It includes 10 bridges, two interchanges and a number of other investments that they need to make in that particular area that will certainly help the fishermen, the tourists and also those who are trying to commute from the southern to the northern area.", "I remember a time when the investments in Ontario weren’t what they are now, and the north certainly didn’t fare well until 2003, when our government took over to continue the investments. We’re trying to create one Ontario. As Premier Kathleen Wynne has said on many occasions, we will continue to invest in northern infrastructure, whether it’s in highways, roads, bridges, hospitals, water or waste water systems, through our ambitious $160 billion worth of infrastructure plans. So while the NDP can pontificate and play politics, our government takes strong action to ensure that we have investments in the north." ],

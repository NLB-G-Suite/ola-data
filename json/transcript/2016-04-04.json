I’ve got the Polar Bear Riders, the Jackpine Snowmobile Club, the A14 Task Force snowmobile club, the Golden Corridor snowmobile club, the Near North Trail Association, the Elk Lake Trail Blazers snowmobile club, the West Nipissing Snowmobile Club, the Nipissing Veuve River Snowmobile Club, and the French River Snow Devils.

I started out on a 250 Elan a long, long time ago, a Ski-Doo. It was broken and frozen all the time. We had to become mechanics. We did a lot more fixing than we did snowmobiling. Now I have a Renegade Backcountry, and I put on quite a few kilometres with my friends. Snowmobiling has come a long way because we snowmobile; we no longer fix. They’ve come a long, long way. It’s a great feeling.", "Why this sport is possible is because all the people and these snowmobile clubs groom the trails. What’s unique about snowmobiling is that a lot of the trails are on private land, and the private landowners give permission for the clubs to use their land. That’s what makes the sport truly fantastic: On a snowmobile, you can see parts of Ontario that are inaccessible to the public in any other way. You can drive, depending on where the trail goes, past livestock farms, past people’s personal picnic spots. You can drive by fantastic spots. It’s one of the things that makes it so incredible.", "I’m just going to give a shout-out to my colleague from Timmins-James Bay, because on my birthday we went from Cochrane, stayed at the Westway Motel, and we went to the Abitibi Canyon loop on the snow machine.

Typically, when a snowmobile trail goes across farmland, the farmer loses money because the crops are impacted. So farmers—and I’m going to speak as a farmer because that’s who I know best—do this as community members, because they know how much it brings to the community and they’re proud to be part of this system. So the system is working fairly well.", "And then we get Bill 100. Actually, there are some good provisions in Bill 100. It creates a Trails Week, which is great. It does make some changes regarding liability—so taking liability away from the landowner. That’s great. People have been pushing for that for a long time. Where it gets kind of murky and where landowners—and there’s a group called the Ontario Landowners. I’m not a member. Sometimes I say “landowners”; I should say “property owners,” because I don’t really agree with some of the things the landowners are saying on this issue. If I say “landowner,” I’m not speaking for them. I’m a property owner. Sometimes I mispronounce the word.", "What this bill proposes to do is that a property owner could give an easement—to a snowmobile club, in this case—and there’s a reason for this. I’ll give a shout-out to the president of the Tri-Town Sno Travellers, Bill Ramsay. I talked to him about this bill. He gave me an example: If there’s a farm or a piece of land that you’re going go across and the snowmobile club needs to put a bridge there and the bridge is a quarter-million dollars, right now there’s no guarantee other than a handshake with the landowner that they can access that bridge after it’s put up. If they could have an easement to get to that bridge—that’s why this would be a good bill. That’s a good point.", "I’m not going to give them in the House, but there are places in my riding where this bill makes a lot of sense. But where it causes some issues is with easements, because when a farmer hears the word “easement,” he hears the words “loss of control of his land.” He hears the word “lawyer,” which is going to cost him money, right? And you say, “Farmers must be a very suspicious bunch.” No, they’re not. Neither are the other property owners.", "This whole trail system was built on trust. I guess the best way I can explain it is how Club Echo started in my riding. When Club Echo first approached me, it was a man by the name of Leon Gravel, and may Leon rest in peace. The only reason that Club Echo got access to my land is because I knew and I trusted Leon. He was a fellow dairy farmer. He said, “We want to make this trail. We’re going to mark it off. We’re going to do all these things. If somebody goes off the trail, we’ll make sure that doesn’t happen again. We’re going to put gates where we break through your fences. We’re going to make sure the fences are better than they were before.” And they did all those things.", "We gave permission because we trusted Leon. Part of that—anyone who gave permission to Club Echo got an Echo pass. That was a little piece of paper, and if you happened to have a snowmobile, you had the right to go on Club Echo’s trails. For those of you at home, I believe it was to Englehart and halfway to New Liskeard. That was lots for me. I didn’t want to go any farther. I couldn’t make it any farther. But that’s how it started, and Club Echo ran very well. Then Club Echo went together with the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs. Good move, but we didn’t have any relationship with the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs. All the property owners got a nice letter in the mail: “Club Echo is now part of the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs. Thank you for letting us cross your land, but if you want to get on the trail, you’re now going to have to buy the $250 pass; end of discussion.” But they never asked us.", "I was president of the Temiskaming Federation of Agriculture.

The fine print says “with or without covenant,” and they read “lawyer.” There’s a real danger that farm groups led by younger radicals than me are going to pull their support. You can ask Bill Ramsay. He’s as worried as I am that the trails will collapse because of this. I know that the farmer doesn’t have to grant an easement, but it’s just the idea that we’re talking about—you need much clearer English on what the rights are and what they’re not.", "Further in this act, if the landowner does grant an easement, you read, “An easement may be assigned by an eligible body to another eligible body,” which means that if you don’t have something written right at the start, someone who you never had a relationship with could give the use of your land to someone else 10 years down the road. Farmers are happy having a snowmobile trail cross their land, but if it’s an ATV trail, it’s a whole different story, because then you’re trampling over our crops.

They didn’t fix them, and TransCanada PipeLines was in no mood to fix them because they didn’t cause the problem, so that’s the way it stayed.

There is absolutely nothing to gain, and they’re not asking for anything to be gained. They don’t gain personally from the trails. They want to help the community by having the trails.

The minister put out a couple of press releases stating what the government’s intention was, and the press releases were good. But the press release—basically, that should be in the documentation. It should be in the bill. That way, when OFSC or someone comes to use your property and they say, “No, you don’t have to sign the easement.

They’re much more economical than they used to be, but they still do use a bit of gas.", "I represent all of those people and I want this sector to flourish and I want this province to flourish. I implore the government, do this one right. Let it pass second reading. Hold legitimate committee hearings throughout the province. Let’s all work together to come up with legitimate, good amendments that will make this bill better and stronger and make it represent everyone in the province. Let’s all work together on this one. We have the capability to make this good. The minister understands; I know he understands. Let’s hope that his government does, because if his government doesn’t understand what’s happening here or what could happen, snowmobile trails in lots of parts of the province will close. And it will be on their heads." ],

I think this is essentially what the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane was asking for: that the purpose of the bill be stated right in the bill, to put some of the landowners’ concerns at ease, because these trails that are in Timiskaming–Cochrane and Parry Sound–Muskoka are so important for the folks who live there, for tourism, for people who enjoy outdoor activities.

By improving cycling infrastructure by making our highways and streets safer, the Ministry of Transportation is supporting the expansion of our trail network and encouraging a culture of wellness in Ontario. As part of the #CycleON strategy, I was pleased to announce just a few weeks ago that the town of Newmarket—part of my riding—is receiving $325,000 in funding towards the construction of a new, five-kilometre bike lane.", "I just wanted to take a few minutes to talk about my experience, because I have experience with two different types of jurisdictions. I live in an urban area, a residential area of Aurora. I was a town councillor there for a number of years. Aurora has some of the most beautiful off-road trails that you can find, that meander through the Oak Ridges moraine. I walked those trails with my children for many years, Mr. Speaker, and took my dog there for walks. What I learned through the advocacy of phenomenal people like Klaus Wehrenberg, who lives in Aurora and is a real urban active-transportation advocate, is that there’s a difference between a recreational trail and an active-transportation trail. I hadn’t realized until I became a town councillor that with good urban planning, we can put in place trails that lead from a child’s house to the school that lessen the need for them to walk along a busy, smelly, dangerous street, and that businesspeople, when they are leaving the St. John’s Sideroad to the north end of Aurora, can walk through the beautiful Aurora arboretum in a beautiful trail setting down to the GO station on Wellington. I’m constantly amazed at the number of people who do that sort of thing, who move from point A to point B on business or shopping or school using off-road trail systems.", "So not all trails are recreational. There are many trails in urban settings that get us from point A to point B, and it’s exceptionally important that those who are involved with urban planning make sure we put those plans in place.", "This year, we saw the Pan/Parapan Am secretariat also taking steps to fulfill the promise to Ontarians. Those games inspired us to lead more active lives and then went a step further, leaving Ontario with an amazing legacy in the Pan Am trail: over $3.5 million invested to fill in over 250 kilometres of gap in our trails network.", "Of course, the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport is leading the Supporting Ontario’s Trails Act with support from the Attorney General, who is overseeing the modifications to the Occupiers’ Liability Act, and Natural Resources and Forestry, who oversee changes to the Public Lands Act—five different groups overseen by four different ministers, all working in tandem to achieve one purpose, a purpose created and driven by stakeholders.", "This is a grassroots piece of legislation, Mr. Speaker. We engaged over 250 stakeholders to develop Bill 100, and before the opposition asks: Yes, of course, we consulted numerous property owners. We held regional consultation sessions not only in Toronto; we held them in Thunder Bay, in Ingersoll, in North Bay, and in Ottawa. Our government held in-person conversations with aboriginal groups, 80 municipalities, health organizations, tourism organizations, academics and farmers, and of course, Mr. Speaker, with our trail organizations.", "After that, we posted Bill 100 on the Environmental Registry, where it was open to public comment for 48 days. We took each of the 80 online comments to heart, Mr. Speaker. They were reviewed by senior policy staff and lawyers from four separate ministries.", "I know in their leadoff speech the opposition claimed that we didn’t consult on Bill 100. I can say, Mr. Speaker, that that simply isn’t true. The record bears this out.", "The bill has been in development since 2013. And while our government has taken great care to understand what the sector wants and needs, to balance the desires of diverse stakeholder groups, I got the impression from the PC leadoff speech that they listened to one stakeholder, and just one stakeholder.", "As we start debate, I think it’s important to remind everyone that Bill 100 is an enabling piece of legislation. What I mean by that is that Bill 100, if passed, would provide landowners with additional options and additional tools for establishing land arrangements. Landowners will have the option to continue to use existing arrangements if that’s what they want to do.", "When we were doing our broad consultations, we heard from landowners who said that the current system was working for them, and farmers who said they wouldn’t use a trail easement because each year they rotate which section of their land they allow local snowmobile clubs to use. We talked with landowners who wanted a way to carry on their generosity into perpetuity by registering an easement on title. We spoke with trail organizations who had invested large quantities of money in building bridges for trail users and wanted some assurance that they would be able to continue to use the infrastructure they had paid for.", "You see, Mr. Speaker, this option isn’t for everyone, and was never intended to be used by everyone. That is why Bill 100 would create an additional voluntary system to establish trail easements that individuals may or may not choose to use.", "As we continue to debate, I know that our members will continue to highlight what Bill 100 will do, if passed, and we will continue to debunk the misconceptions that some members of the opposition seem adamant in articulating during their speaking turns.", "Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the continued debate on the Supporting Ontario’s Trails Act, and would call on all members of this House to support both Bill 100 and Ontario’s amazing trail network." ],

On a warm day, you can find cyclists, rollerbladers and walkers all actively using the Walter Bean trail. I see you smiling there, so you’re obviously familiar with this trail. It’s a very favourite place for my family, and we’ve enjoyed it for many years, as have many people in Kitchener Centre. At 11 kilometres long, the Walter Bean trail runs along the banks of the Grand River and connects to Schneider Park. In addition to being very scenic, the trail features highlights of our great Canadian heritage. Throughout the trail, there are displays that remind trail users of the indigenous populations that lived along the banks of the Grand River. When it’s completed, the trail is going to run 76 kilometres, connecting Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo and Woolwich.", "Our government recognizes that trails are a fantastic way to showcase our unique Canadian culture, and to champion the social and economic benefits of active living. That’s why I was very excited two weeks ago when the Premier announced $975,000 over two years for the region of Waterloo to build additional cycling and walking trails. We made this announcement inside a small bike shop in Cambridge. We were joined by some of our municipal partners, and they were very excited by this announcement. They’re looking forward to the funding flowing so that they can get started with the construction of these trails.", "I’m looking forward to new and accessible paths connecting my communities’ two universities.

This is just down the street from where my constituency office is, and once all the snow melts, I look forward to riding my bicycle to work during constituency weeks.", "Each and every time our government invests in trail infrastructure, we do renew our commitment to cultivating a culture of wellness and recreation in Ontario. It’s because of our commitment to that culture of wellness that we’ve brought forward this particular act.", "We’ve already heard members speaking in support of the economic benefits of trails, but I would like to address some concerns raised by some opposition members regarding Bill 100, specifically regarding how it impacts landowners and trail organizations. It’s important to offer some clarity on what’s called duty of care that falls to trail users by landowners and how that’s going to result in a lower level of liability.", "Currently in the province, there are two standards of care as described in Ontario’s Occupiers’ Liability Act. One level, the higher level, requires that an owner protect a person entering his or her property against all reasonable, foreseeable circumstances. If you’re a grocery store owner, for instance, that means taking care in case there is a spill: You get a mop and you mop it up. You want to make sure that your customers don’t slip and injure themselves, and you face a lawsuit.", "If you’re a landowner who is volunteering his or her land to a trail organization, a higher level of care would mean that you’d have to fix the potholes and clear fallen trees in a very timely manner. But if you are willingly volunteering your land for the enjoyment of others, holding you to that level of care seems rather onerous. It’s a level of care to which we do not intend to hold owners of trails. Unfortunately, when trail users pay minimal fees for something unrelated to the use of a trail—say, for instance, parking—it becomes very ambiguous as to what standard of care a landowner owes to a trail user. If it’s passed, Bill 100 is going to clarify that. It’s going to make it clear that only the lower standard of care is owed to the trail user.", "By transferring the responsibility from landowners to trail users, our government does a number of things. First, we’re going to further protect landowners, and by protecting landowners, it’s our belief that it’s going to increase access to trails by removing one of the barriers that discourages landowners from volunteering their land. Secondly, by clarifying what standard of care is required, we can help ensure that organizations pay insurance based only on that lower level of care. Sometimes, volunteer trail organizations may indemnify landowners in an effort to cultivate relationships. I’m glad that our government is helping to promote owners to look at the lower-level costs for our volunteering organizations by outlining language within the Occupiers’ Liability Act.", "I’m encouraged by what our government is doing to remove red tape and to protect both our generous landowners and our active volunteers.", "I would call on all members to familiarize themselves with Bill 100 and to support this very important and beneficial piece of legislation, such as members have already done—who are with Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington and the member for Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, who is sitting across from me there. He has said that he supports this. I’ve had the opportunity to go along some trails in Bruce county, and they’re absolutely lovely.", "Once members read the bill for themselves, I am certain that they will see that there is great merit in Bill 100.", "Mr. Speaker, if you are ever in the Kitchener-Waterloo area any time soon, I encourage you to check out the Walter Bean trail. It’s magnificent.

They support healthy, active lifestyles through exercise, promote social interaction, and encourage active transportation like walking and cycling, as the doctor sitting in front of me reminded me recently. It’s well known that physical activity relieves stress and tension and can help prevent obesity, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and depression. Less known is that active trail use has been shown to enhance mental well-being and brain health throughout life.

If it’s a can of pop, they bring the can back; if it’s a piece of paper, they bring it back. They will actually stop and pick up any debris along the way.", "I also want to explain skiing. When you see a double black diamond, you instantly have an idea how challenging the slope can be.

Snowmobile owners—if they reference some 30,000 permits at an average of $200 a permit, you would see that that’s $6 million that snowmobilers take care of themselves. They pay to operate the equipment. They pay the men and women who run the equipment. They pay for the grooming of trails. They pay for a lot of other things.

Over the years, a very respectful and co-operative arrangement has been developed between the two groups. It’s well established now that snowmobilers are a responsible, respectful group of people who cause farmers no problems. There’s no litter, no damage; no problems whatsoever. As a consequence, the farmers have grown to trust these organizations, to trust the snowmobilers to be good citizens and to be responsible.", "It’s a respectful arrangement both ways. Landowners respect that snowmobilers would like to have trails across the province of Ontario. As the landowners co-operate, these trails are there for them. That is the system we have now. It works very well, and it has worked very well for a long time. There is no problem, so why do we need a bill?

She brought forward comments regarding the indigenous recognition. This is extremely important, and we need to be conscious of this in all areas of legislation and in every single ministry. She also made a reference to the social and economic benefits, a culture of wellness, and also the Occupiers’ Liability Act. These are all very important aspects of this bill.", "The member from Ajax–Pickering also made reference to the economic benefits and said something that was very important that related to black diamonds on ski runs. What happens when you enter a trail and you’ve got some kids in tow with you? You need to be sure that you can manage the trail. This piece of legislation will lay out that strategy.", "So I wouldn’t really call this an unnecessary piece of legislation. I think it’s very necessary. In every area that we work with and every piece of legislation that we bring forward, it’s very important to consider the safety of our citizens. We need to make sure that those classifications are done properly, and I thank all of my colleagues for bringing their voices forward." ],

I know how important that trail system is to local realtors, gas stations and cafes along the way. I know that, for many of them, without that type of income from snowmobilers during the winter months, they simply couldn’t exist. It’s very important to tourism in that part of Ontario and, of course, across Ontario.", "I wanted to address the comments by the member from Carleton–Mississippi Mills because the reason this bill, Bill 100, is before us is very simple: Stakeholders asked us for it.

This bill has been brought forward. It changes quite a number of pieces of legislation. When you end up changing plenty of legislation, it’s very important to make sure that we’ve had a close look at the implications of the changes going forward and that Ontarians understand the bill before it reaches final passage and moves into regulation.", "Our party has talked to numerous members here of the importance of trails and the importance of preserving and promoting Ontario’s trail infrastructure. Quite a bit of the economy in rural Ontario can be derived from usage of these trails and having access to these trails. We wanted to make sure, with this bill coming forward, that there was enough consultation that was listened to. You hear the government say that they have consulted and they were asked to come forward with it, but I couldn’t tell you the number of calls that members on this side of the House are receiving with concerns about this bill, which leads to the question: How great was this consultation process, then?", "This government has a history of saying they consulted but doing the opposite. We only have to look at this past budget, where the finance committee of the House toured the province and was in the midst of writing a report, and the budget was already printed and ready to be reported. Or we can talk today of, in the budget, the government coming forward about changing the deductibles for seniors’ drugs, raising it up to $130 a year and adding an extra $1 copayment. Today they announced, “We’re going to put that on pause.” That just leads me to believe that they didn’t consult on that.", "With the history of the lack of consultation or the smokescreen—the smoke and mirrors, I guess you could say—of saying they have consulted, it raises flags on this side of the House. We want to bring these concerns forward during this second reading debate. We’re hoping the government takes a second look at this bill and reaches out to those groups that have concerns before going forward, because there are serious concerns that property owners were not properly consulted when this bill came forward, nor were some clubs throughout the province.", "As I said earlier, Ontario has numerous trails, and they are a huge draw for outdoor activities. We need to ensure that not only are there proper protections in place but at the same time we need to promote our local trails. We do support the intent of Bill 100 to promote trail preservation and increased awareness but, again, referring back to the consultation processes that we on this side of the House have concerns about. We would like to see that fixed going forward.", "As a result of these poor consultations, my office is getting calls from property owners who have trails on their properties. I have had a municipality call my office inquiring what’s going on with Bill 100. Unfortunately, what I’m hearing from municipalities, I’m also hearing from private landowners: that access is being cancelled to the trails. When you shut down the trails, you’re not helping local rural economies, you’re not helping the promotion of trails. What you’re doing is actually damaging the various aspects that make Ontario beautiful, and that’s a concern here.", "You would think that if we had started properly and had proper consultations, besides the three locations the members have stated—I don’t think they went to Owen Sound. I’m pretty sure that Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound has tremendous amounts of trails that I think would have been a great place to sit down and talk.", "I don’t know if they reached out to northern Ontario or not either. I realize that with this government northern Ontario is Barrie to them. But, in fact, it goes far, far north. I think reaching out and talking to us—Ingersoll is a great place; that’s the member from Oxford’s locale and it probably could take in some of the surrounding areas.", "Toronto: I guess you could include Toronto. It’s going to be where the committee hearings are going to be held.", "But the fact is that you’ve missed some key areas of this province with regard to input into Bill 100, and I think that’s something we need to ensure happens, so that the future access to Ontario trails isn’t put at risk due to Bill 100.", "I don’t know why the government doesn’t sit back and pull the bill back and have real consultations. This bill has sat on the order paper since May of last year. We’re almost at the one-year anniversary since they introduced the bill. It wasn’t a priority to push it through and get it done because it just sat. We’re actually starting to debate it now almost a year after it was introduced.", "So for the urgency of this government, why not pull it back? There’s enough outroar from the rural communities of this province to take another look at this bill. Take the time. You’ve waited a year. If the trails are still operating without this bill—although some have shut down because of the fear of this bill—why not take it back and have a proper consultation? Go to northern Ontario. Go to Owen Sound. Take your time. We’d help you with this consultation process. We would be part of it and help draw out the people to talk about the problems with this bill.", "So we request that the government delay this bill. Hold back. Let’s have some more public consultations and ensure that we get it right. Because if we look back to Bill 45, we’re dealing with Bill 178 right now because they rushed through a bill. They didn’t do proper consultation and now they’re going, “Oops, we need to do another bill to fix Bill 45.” As I said before, why do you have to deal with that? You missed putting that part of the legislation of Bill 178 into Bill 45. We saw that in, I guess it was, December when they had to backpedal with regard to medical marijuana and come out with this bill to kind of fix things.", "So why not step back and fix this trails act? There are 2,500 trails in Ontario; 80,000 kilometres of land; and, from what I’ve read, almost $2 billion of economic activity each year is generated. Snowmobiling alone generates $853 million—and that’s for the 2013-14 calendar year—and created roughly 11,307 jobs, according to the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs.", "They’re not only important for the economic activity, but Ontario trails also support active lifestyles and improve health and well-being. It’s great to be in the outdoors and enjoying the trails. It’s a great family event. You can take your kids out and you can take your wife out—speaking from my side of things—and enjoy what nature has to offer in our areas. My wife usually makes me go for walks to try to keep in shape and alive, I guess, further down the road, but sometimes we like to go off into the ravine behind our house and just walk through what nature has to offer. We have many opportunities throughout my riding to do so. Maintaining and enjoying Ontario’s trails is a great way to learn about the environment and stay healthy, and the offshoot is a stronger economy for Ontario.", "So what does the bill do? Schedule 1 of Bill 100 establishes a process for property owners to grant easements to one or more eligible bodies. Then that body would register the easement. One issue that raises up is that the easement may be assigned or transferred by one eligible body to another one without the consent of the landowner. That’s a concern that has been flagged quite a bit from conversations I have had. Original restrictions on use of the property would run with the land but the landowner could not restrict. One thing that’s a concern is that once the easement is created, it can’t be revoked. Although this act will design to preserve and entrench trails, when the property is sold the new owner cannot shut down that easement. That’s a concern.", "Schedule 5 of Bill 100 contains provisions to enhance protection of crown lands from damage and strengthen enforcement. A section is added which states, “Any person who causes a prescribed type of damage to crown land or crown property ... is guilty of an offence.” If that person is found guilty they’re required to rehabilitate or repair the damaged land—in addition to a fine. I think that’s an important part of the bill. Many of the trails in my riding—there are private landowners but there are a number of crown lands that do have the trails that we do enjoy.", "Schedule 6 of Bill 100 is meant to increase the maximum fine for those convicted of trespassing to $10,000. It eliminates the $1,000 limit on compensation for damages a court may award upon a trespassing conviction. I think it’s key to point out that the private member’s bill of the member from Dufferin–Caledon, the Respecting Private Property Act, did just that. It raised the maximum fine. The Ontario Federation of Agriculture supported Bill 36, but they’re disappointed with the government on the fact that these schedules do not go far enough to address the concerns relating to farm safety and bio-security relating to trespassing. Our farms are becoming more high-tech and trespassing is becoming a serious concern. It’s not just with trails. If you talk to your local anglers and hunters, that’s a great concern for landowners, to have trespassing occurring on their properties.", "Last year—I have to give credit to the Aylmer district stakeholders—they coordinated a project with the OPP and came up with an educational program with posters, handouts and flyers, and distributed them throughout the riding to help decrease the incidents of trespassing. It did settle it down a bit. But when you start getting the landowners worried, the farmers worried that possible trespassing can affect their business, or in fact that they could actually lose oversight of their own land through these easements, you might see these trails shut down. We did see the threat of that and the shutdown. I had a trail in the northern part of my riding. He actually shut down his trail for the winter. There wasn’t much snow anyway for the snowmobiles. He was so uncertain of what was going on, he just said, “Forget it. We’re going to keep it shut down for this session.”", "The concerns that I have been worrying about, and many, many landowners in this province are worried about, is that eventually the government will force them into an easement. I know this legislation. It stated that it’s a voluntary process. The government assured us it’s a voluntary process. This government also said a year ago, with regard to wind turbine projects, that local municipalities would have a say in allowing wind turbines in their area. They were assured some of the autonomy that the Green Energy Act took from them. If you look in my riding, we’ve got Malahide township and Dutton Dunwich. Both had projects going forward for wind turbines. Malahide said, “Yes, let’s have wind turbines.” Dutton Dunwich said, “No, we don’t want wind turbines.” Government says, “Okay, we’ll give them to Dutton Dunwich.”", "So the fact that this government says that municipalities are going to have a say of some sort, be a part of the process—their actions don’t follow through. So when they say Bill 100 is going to be voluntary for landowners with regard to these easements, they don’t have the credibility to back up what they’re saying. Landowners, people in rural Ontario especially, do not trust this government’s words with regard to that, Mr. Speaker. The fact that the easements can be transferred from one body to another causes quite a bit of worry with regard to landowners.", "Our member from Carleton–Mississippi Mills has spoken a little bit with regard to this bill, and I’m sure we’ll hear more from him, but he raises quite a few fair points when he questions why easements have made their way into this legislation to start with. Farmers didn’t ask for them, snowmobile clubs didn’t ask for them, and the easements didn’t offer any benefit to either party, so why are easements necessary or even in this legislation, Mr. Speaker?", "In my riding of Elgin, we have a number of clubs that I’d like to point out while we’re talking about Bill 100: the Elgin Hiking Trail Club, which just celebrated its 40th anniversary last year; the Talbot Trail ATV Club; and the Elgin Trail Riders Snowmobile Club. It’s interesting with the snowmobile club that we don’t really usually have enough snow for good trails; you usually have to go up to—" ],

This bill is not going to shut down the crown lands, the conservation area lands; the problem is that this bill is going to shut down the private trails which usually connect these trails to one another and ensure that people have access to them.", "Just to summarize: Many of the farmers in my riding have contacted my office. Many trail users have contacted my office. There is a lot of confusion with Bill 100. There is a lot of explanation needed with Bill 100. We don’t think enough consultation was given to areas of Ontario which this directly affects, especially in the rural areas which depend on the economic activity of their trails. They don’t have the diversity to draw on other areas.", "So we’re asking the government to take a second look at this legislation. They’ve waited a year. We’re almost at the one-year anniversary since it was introduced. We can wait longer if they pull it back. We’ve got the summer coming up. Let’s sit down and have some great consultation in those areas of the province.", "At the very least—they’ll probably push this bill through with their majority—when it reaches the committee level, let the committee outside of Toronto. You’re not going to get people from northern Ontario coming down to speak to this bill. You’re probably not going to get many people from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound to come and talk about this bill. Let the committee travel to these areas and have a discussion on how to fix this bill. Answer the questions and bring those amendments forward.", "Hopefully, when we get those amendments and bring them forward in committee, the members of the government side will listen to the opposition side and maybe adapt some of those amendments. I just sat in on Bill 119, and the government shot down every single amendment that both the third party and our party brought forward, and it was quite disappointing that that occurred.", "So let the committee tour. Utilize the aspect in rural Ontario. Try not to make it so complicated a system that we have to get lawyers involved. For the majority of the private trails, it’s a handshake and the honour system, which we still have in this province of Ontario. We don’t need to have the mountains of work and lawyers.", "We’re seeing it with our grain farmers with the neonics and the amount of paperwork that they’re having to go through. They are throwing their arms up in the air, and they’re going to get more paperwork for their trails, which are voluntary. They’re going to say “Forget about it,” and these trails are going to be shut down. That’s going to be a tragedy for Ontario.", "So I’m hoping they listen.

It is a wonderful asset. It’s the jewel in the crown, quite frankly, of the London area’s trail system.", "In London, we recognize the benefit of having access to this kind of trail system because of the recreational opportunities that it provides for families and individuals who live in our city; the improved health outcomes that come along with access to trails and participating in these kinds of recreational activities; the tourism benefits of drawing people to the region to take advantage of the trail system; and, of course, the economic development benefits of being able to draw new workers to our community and keep them there because of the amenities that are available in our region.", "So I’m very troubled by what is happening as Bill 100, the Supporting Ontario’s Trails Act, moves forward. This is an example of those unintended consequences, when the government doesn’t think through the implications of what it is proposing. As a result of all of the confusion and the concerns that have arisen because of Bill 100, we see sections of this treasured trail system that we have in Thames Valley being closed. One third of that trail system passes through private land, through farmland, and that trail system is now at risk." ],

She has really spoken very passionately about the trails in her area of London West. I did want to acknowledge that. But there was also a reference made by the member from Elgin–Middlesex–London to wind turbines and the government listening. One of the reasons why we changed the legislation with respect to the siting of energy projects was exactly so that we had the mechanism in place to listen to communities. The Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport has been listening to the trails communities and associations. Since 2005, we have been working with them and understanding some concerns that there are. We’ve attempted to remediate those concerns within this legislation.", "If there is continued confusion about the bill, as has been stated, I hope that those constituents’ inquiries would come forward to the ministry so that they can be addressed appropriately." ],

The Howard Watson trail, which is on the old railroad right-of-way, goes from Sarnia up to points near Camlachie—about 23 miles or so. There’s talk of extending that further. It’s unfortunate that over the years a number of these municipalities let the land go back—they should have kept them open, the old railroad rights-of-way, because now it’s going to be very difficult to further extend these. They go across a lot of nice scenery and some nice territory.", "We have a new trail, and that’s from Wyoming to Reeces Corners. It’s probably about three kilometres. A lot of municipal co-operation and local fundraising went into bringing that trail in. There’s talk of extending that from Wyoming to Petrolia.

I’ve stood in this House I don’t know how many times and said that it’s great to make laws and legislation in this House but we have to make sure it works out on the field. This is an example. The basis of good legislation is here. It’s the duty of the government to work with the process to make this legislation actually work in the field, because if this legislation doesn’t work in the field, it’s going to have the opposite effect; it’s actually going to close trails in a lot of the parts of the province.", "Why that is is because the typical stakeholder who comes to government and is going to call the ministry has a vested interest, but a lot of the stakeholders in the trail system have no vested interest. They’re doing it out of the goodness of their hearts. Most farmers have a trail going across their farm out of the goodness of their hearts. If they see a piece of legislation that has any type of risk that they don’t understand, they’re not going to call the ministry and talk about consultations; they’re just not going to sign the current agreement. So they’re going to stop trails across their farm because it’s just not worth the risk, and that would be an incredible shame because we have a good system.", "If this bill is done correctly, it could help the trail system, but with the record of this government, how many amendments from the opposing side have ever passed here? None. That’s what we’re so worried about, because if this bill passes the way it is, there is a good chance that some of those property owners will see what happened and say, “Look, my life isn’t reflected in this bill, so OFSC, you know what?

Without their incredible dedication, their hard work, and, in some cases, public resources, we would not have such spectacular trails right across this province. So I want to just make sure to say thank you. Thank you for being out there keeping the trails clear and usable all year round.", "Having our trails is about more than just seeing the sights. It’s about keeping yourself healthy. One of my colleagues talked about that here today, and then one of my other colleagues said it’s nice that his wife wants to keep him healthy as well. I didn’t understand that, but she did say it. It’s about promoting our province. It is about building our economy.", "In Niagara Falls, Fort Erie and Niagara-on-the-Lake, we have lots of seniors who come to my riding, quite frankly, to enjoy their retirement years. They come because my riding is beautiful, a quiet place to relax alongside some of the best craft brewers, like Silversmith, Oast House and the Niagara Brewing Co., and our wonderful VQA wineries.", "I spend a lot of time in those communities listening to our seniors and learning from their experiences, and recently I started to hear some things that were troubling. I hear from seniors that their hydro bills are going up, that their food costs are going up, and now, based purely on a decision of this government, their drug and health costs are going up. To me, Mr. Speaker, that is not acceptable. They are the people who built our province and they deserve better from this government.", "But in fairness, I also hear happier stories from the seniors of my riding when I speak with them. I get to hear about their grandkids’ hiking trips into our provincial parks. I get to hear about how the dirt paths they remember from their childhoods have become full-fledged trails. I always get to hear about what they heard or saw the last time they went out for a walk. Speaker, the fact that they’re able to get out on our trails for a walk is a great thing. It’s a great thing for our seniors and, really, for everyone in this province because it helps them stay active.", "We all know that the cost of health care in this province continues to rise. The more we can encourage everyone to get out and be active is better for everyone and certainly better for health costs in the province of Ontario. Prevention is one of the best methods we have when it comes to controlling health care costs. By encouraging people to stay active, whether that means hiking the trails in our provincial parks or going for an afternoon stroll along the Niagara River and the Niagara Parkway, we are helping our health care system, our communities and our residents to stay healthy.", "Mr. Speaker, the fact that promoting and protecting our extensive network of trails in this province is beneficial for both our health care system and, especially, to the health of our constituents is just one of the reasons that the goal for this bill, the Supporting Ontario’s Trails Act, is one that I and my caucus colleagues can stand behind—with some amendments.", "Protecting, promoting and preserving our trails also has other benefits that I think we need to acknowledge. As I’m sure you all know—and many probably have first-hand experience—my riding of Niagara Falls relies on tourism for a big chunk of our economy. People come to visit the craft brewers and the VQA wines that I mentioned, as well as many more. They come to Niagara Falls to see the Falls themselves or to visit one of our casinos. They don’t take a lot of money home from those casinos when they come to the casinos; it creates jobs. They come to Niagara-on-the-Lake to see the performances at the Shaw Festival or to enjoy the fruits of our farms at the Peach Festival. They come to buy local—locally grown fruit, vegetables and wine. They come to Crystal Beach, which is in my riding, to enjoy the beachfront trails. They come to Fort Erie to watch the races, to visit the historic fort, and hopefully—and hopefully the Liberal Party is listening to this—someday they’ll come to play the slots again at the Fort Erie Race Track.", "In my riding there is a huge variety of activities you can participate in, depending on which community you’re visiting. But, no matter where you go, there’s one thing you can always do: You can go outside and you can walk along or ride along one of our beautiful trails. In Niagara-on-the-Lake, you can see the end of the Bruce Trail at Queenston Heights, which starts 10 ridings and 900 kilometres away as part of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, or you can walk out into the 45-hectare Woodend Conservation Area and admire the beauty of the forest. In Niagara Falls, you can walk six kilometres along the Niagara Parkway—or ride a bike or motorcycle; whatever you need—starting at the Niagara Gorge and making your way through the Botanical Gardens to the Floral Clock.", "How many of you here have been to the Floral Clock?

You can see how the trails take care of that whole riding.", "Finally, in Fort Erie, you can walk on the 16-kilometre Friendship Trail beside Lake Erie. Starting at the border of Port Colborne—which is in my colleague’s riding—in the west, the trail runs along an abandoned rail track, through lush farmland, quiet villages, wetlands, and quiet residential areas until you make it out to historic Old Fort Erie. From there, you can head out to Ridgeway, where you can enjoy the history or the view. Both are certainly worth doing.", "These trails are part of what makes my riding of Niagara Falls and the entire Niagara region so unique. You can easily walk through the history of our great country while at the same time exploring the beautiful natural landscape that has been preserved here.", "That uniqueness is important. It’s a big part of why we, as a riding and as a community, have been so successful in the tourist industry. We can offer you a mix of entertainment, from casinos in Niagara Falls to world-class horse racing in Fort Erie—and I’ll just say this—where we need more race days and the slots back, by the way. We can offer you history and natural beauty that makes, I truly believe, a combination that would be hard to match anywhere in the world.", "Our trails and the sights on them attract thousands and thousands of visitors to my riding every year from all over the world. They come to spend their days walking along and enjoying the beauty of our community, and the province of Ontario, and they spend their evenings in our hotels and our restaurants, supporting our local economy and helping to maintain jobs in our riding. By protecting, preserving and expanding our network of trails in this province and by promoting their use, we’ll help grow the number of tourists visiting every year, not only in my riding but right across the province.", "More tourists means more money being spent in our communities. More money being spent in our communities means more jobs. More jobs in our communities means that the people who live there are better off.", "I know, from talking to people in my riding, that good jobs are one of the top priorities for them. The more we can do to create jobs—good, stable, full-time jobs—in our province, the better. This is one of those things that we can do, so I support the goal of doing it. Clearly, supporting Ontario trails is a good thing for Niagara Falls, for Niagara region and, quite frankly, for the entire province of Ontario.", "Unfortunately, I find myself once again in a very familiar position. Other people have said this already. In fact, it almost seems like every week that I stand up to speak in this House, we are discussing the same sort of problems with a government bill.", "Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear: Supporting Ontario trails is an important and well-meaning goal. As I just outlined, the trails in my riding are a big part of the economy and our community, and I am positive that the same is true for many of you in the House today talking about your ridings. However, once again, I find myself looking at a bill that falls short in details.", "When this bill was first debated for second reading, on February 18, we heard concerns from several different members from vastly different parts of the province—which is really interesting—from the southeast, compared to the northwest, about how this will affect their communities. We heard that rather than promoting, protecting and expanding our trail systems here in Ontario, this bill is actually causing trails to close down.", "Mr. Speaker, that is a big problem. When the outcome of a bill in fact is the exact opposite of the stated goal of the bill, then something hasn’t gone according to plan.", "One of the issues that has been raised with respect to this bill is how it handles points where public trails cross into private farmland. According to the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, nearly 20,000 kilometres of the 80,000 kilometres of trails in Ontario run through municipalities, including trails that run along farmland, and these are the points where they have concerns about trespassing on private property.", "The OFL—the OFA; the OFL is a different organization. The OFA has expressed concerns both about the lack of enforcement of the current trespassing law and about the fact that low penalties currently do little to discourage trespassing. These concerns are very real, particularly in rural communities where snow machine trails often go across private farmland, and they need to be addressed in this bill, moving forward.", "An area of concern for me, when I am reading through the bill, also relates to the interaction of trail users and private property. In my research, it became clear to me that current rules around liability of property owners need to be updated. As it currently stands, a trail user who is injured while crossing over private property would be entirely within their rights to pursue legal action against the owner of that property. That means that by simply opening up their farmland for people to cross over as part of the trail, these farm owners are putting themselves at risk.", "One of the possible ways to address this concern is by limiting or eliminating the property owner’s liability if someone were to trespass off the prescribed trail and get injured in the process. Now, I am not a lawyer, so I won’t claim that this is the best or the only solution to this problem. But I can say, with absolute certainty, that if we want Ontario farmers to open up their land for people to cross as part of a trail, we need to do everything we can to ensure that those farm owners are protected, their land is protected and their crops are protected.", "I know that this is an important piece of legislation, so I really do hope that the government is going take these concerns of the OFA and the farmers of our province very seriously. I hope that they are going to go out into rural communities where this is going to have a big impact to talk one-on-one with farmers to address these real concerns. I hope that they are going to have meaningful, ongoing consultation with people that this will affect so that we can get it right the first time. Remember: The outcome of the bill needs to match the goal of the bill for it to be successful.", "I am coming to the end my time, but I want to make sure that you all know about some of the people who support this, as well as those who have concerns with it. Just last week, I had a wonderful opportunity to welcome the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects to Niagara Falls for their 48th annual conference. The OALA was originally founded in 1968, and under the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects Act of 1984, has the responsibility for regulating professional standards, accreditation for the profession, maintaining and improving the examination process, and for approving educational and professional development standards in the industry.", "The landscape architects that I had the chance to meet with were all wonderful people who care deeply about protecting and preserving our environment—our air, our water—and who understand the importance of our trail system in doing that. In fact, the keynote address of the conference was entitled “Great Lakes Waterfront Trail: 20-Year Celebration of Innovation and Partnership.” According to the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects, some of Ontario’s finest landscape architects were among the founders of the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail in the early 1990s. This year, the trail is going to be celebrating its 21st anniversary, and I want to make sure you all know that it’s going to be a big celebration on April 26.", "I’ll stop there, because I see my time is up.

It lends itself to hiking; it lends itself to just casual walking while you’re sightseeing and seeing the historic sites; it lends itself to cycling. We now have people who travel from Toronto to Niagara just so they can cycle on the trails and enjoy the wonderful Niagara countryside.

I know in my riding of Lambton–Kent–Middlesex, we have a number of trails, and these trails are very important to the economy in my riding. I represent about 100 towns, villages, hamlets and little communities within Lambton–Kent–Middlesex.", "But, Mr. Speaker, when this bill was brought forward and since that time, we have had a lot of calls to our office. There seems to be a lot of confusion around this bill. I think that speaks to what my colleague and my friend from Elgin–Middlesex–London mentioned: that there just wasn’t enough consultation done with different groups and people, at least in my riding of Lambton–Kent–Middlesex, and I suspect across southwestern Ontario and other parts of the province.", "This government really does have a poor track record. I’m sure this is what happens after being in government for 13 or 14 years. They just start making decisions here at Queen’s Park and they forget about people out there. I know in my time here—it’s only been less than five years—we had, as the member from Niagara Falls mentioned, the lack of consultation with the horse racing industry. I think a local example for me is in the riding of Elgin–Middlesex–London—the member from there, Mr. Yurek, mentioned it—with the whole situation around Dutton Dunwich with the wind turbine development. In fact, we had another 16 or so wind turbine developments announced, and these communities don’t want those in their communities." ],

He talked about the Bruce Trail. The trailhead begins in his riding and runs 840 kilometres up to Tobermory. There are 960 landowners along that Bruce Trail system who allow voluntary access to the trails. These are historic agreements based on decades of partnership and trust that have been developed.", "That is somewhat similar to my riding. We have the Thames Valley Trail system. That’s a 115-kilometre trail that passes from Port Stanley up to St. Marys. A third of that trail system passes through private farmland.", "In both of these trail systems, the Bruce Trail and the Thames Valley Trail systems, what we’re seeing, as a result of the botched, quite frankly, implementation of Bill 100, is that parts of this trail system are being closed now by landowners. There is incredible concern that has arisen about what this bill will mean to property owners. As a result, instead of celebrating our trail system, building up our trail system and making it more accessible to Ontarians, we may have inadvertently caused the potential loss of that very important trail system we value so much." ],

He and I are both proud of what we have in the Niagara Peninsula in terms of the trail system. What you always have to be careful of is that it doesn’t disappear. For instance, I compliment the Niagara Escarpment Commission. When it was established a number of years ago, in the 1970s, I thought it was an excellent system that we had, and the plan that we have that protects much of the province of Ontario, at least that part which is located within the Niagara Escarpment Plan.", "The great danger is there are people who can’t wait to undo that. Their idea of a wonderful vista would be a Holiday Inn in the middle of the escarpment, or some other development, because they just obsess with development: “We must develop everything; we must pave everything.” That’s why I think, when we have a system of trails such as this—and I know the member from Niagara Falls would agree with me—we have to preserve it. One of the organizations that has the opportunity to do so, and can be helpful, is the Niagara Escarpment Commission, the people who serve on the commission, who are there to protect this land for the benefit of the people of the province of Ontario.", "As well, we think of the Oak Ridges moraine; we think of other special parts of the province that contain many of these trails. I compliment those people who, on their private property, have of their own volition allowed the use of this land. These people are to be complimented. It was of their own volition, and they recognized the public good. But I think they have a right to expect, as well, that those who use the trails are going to do so in a way that’s going to benefit everyone and not be detrimental to the use of the land itself.

That’s what has to happen. I said in my speech that it might be a good idea if you talk to them individually, because when farmers or property owners hear the word “lawyers,” you’ve got a problem. With no disrespect to the lawyers—it’s probably a great job to have—but at the end of the day, if you’ve got to fight for the rights that you already own—because you own the property. You’re already allowing people to use your trails, to use your property, and then you’re saying, “Well, we’ve got other issues in the bill,” and they’re concerned about it. If I’m going to give any advice to the government on the bill, it’s to make sure that you talk to farmers. Talk to the property owners and make sure that you understand what their concerns are. Don’t go down the road of forcing farmers and homeowners to say, “I’m sorry. I’m not going through this. I’m not going to court. I’m not spending thousands of dollars on lawyers. I’m just not going to let them use the trails.” That would be one of the biggest mistakes I think the province of Ontario could make.", "The way to fix that is to go and talk to them.

Trails offer a place to explore with family and friends, and a place to experience the breathtaking beauty and rich cultural heritage that we identify with Ontario.", "I am especially delighted and excited to speak this afternoon because my riding, the great riding of Davenport, is actually named after a trail. Our archaeologists tell us that before bike lanes were added to Davenport Road in the 1990s, or paved with asphalt in the 20th century, long before it was paved with wooden planks in the mid-19th century, Davenport was a trail. Davenport Road follows a native trail along the foot of the scarp of the old shoreline of Lake Iroquois. The road follows the longest First Nations trail to exist in Ontario. Davenport Road was an ancient footpath known in Ojibway as “Gete-Onigaming,” for “at the old portage.” Davenport Road was a portage route used by indigenous populations to travel between the Humber and Don rivers. My community, Mr. Speaker, started as a trail. What started as a link to two waterways has now become a link to our cultural heritage.", "All throughout Ontario, there are a number of trails that trace long-established aboriginal routes, like the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, which links Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe. Our history is remembered by our trails network, Mr. Speaker. And just as trails act as bridges to our past, our trails connect us to all of the natural wonders Ontario has to offer.", "Cycling lanes, like the one on Davenport Road, encourage and support environmental stewardship through active transportation. Active transportation like cycling and walking helps reduce harmful emissions and contribute to clearer air and reduced respiratory health issues.", "Toronto Public Health estimated in 2007 that air pollution from traffic gave rise to about 440 premature deaths and 1,700 hospitalizations per year in the city of Toronto. That air pollution alone had a negative economic impact of $2.2 billion per year on our economy.", "Bicycling and walking help to alleviate some of the negative effects of intense motorization and help to contribute to national and global efforts to combat global warming. That’s why our government has invested over $130 million in trails since 2009. That’s why our government committed to investing $25 million in cycle-friendly infrastructure, and why we invested $3.5 million to build the Pan Am Path, filling in over 250 kilometres of trail gaps in the province of Ontario. Those are investments in physical fitness, investments in our environment and investments in our health, Mr. Speaker.", "In fact, the medical benefits and costs saved as a result of building trails are almost three times greater than the cost of trail construction and maintenance. Bill 100, the Supporting Ontario’s Trails Act, 2015, complements our government’s investment in trails by increasing the support for landowners.", "Other members have spoken to how Bill 100 lowers the liability that landowners take on. I would like to address how this legislation protects landowners by increasing the penalties for trespass and by streamlining the process of suing for damages. Currently, a person who is convicted of trespassing may be assigned a fine of up to $2,000 and could be awarded damages of up to $1,000. From time to time, trail users will trespass on property adjacent to trails or traverse parts of land where the owner has not allowed users to travel.", "During our broad, wide-reaching consultation process from over 250 stakeholders, we heard from farmers who stated that sometimes fences were cut, leading to damages well in excess of the $1,000 cap when livestock escaped. That is why, if passed, Bill 100 would remove the cap for damages and would allow a judge the ability to award higher fines, up to $10,000. If a farmer can prove damages, we think that they should be able to sue for them.", "Of course, Ontarians have a diverse set of needs. That’s why our government has opted not to put in place a minimum fine. There is only one jurisdiction in Canada with a minimum fine for trespass, and it is set at $2. Instead of minimums, we rely on our judges to decide what level of punishment matches the crime. Through you to members of the opposition seeking a minimum level of fines, Mr. Speaker, I would ask if a teen trespassing at a mall should be automatically fined $500, or a postal worker cutting across a lawn. Our government trusts our judges to deliver measured punishments that match the crime, so Bill 100 takes a balanced approach, enhancing protection for landowners without punishing indiscriminately.", "I’m glad that our government is supporting our trails through investment in cycling lanes, through direct and indirect investments in trails, and through protecting landowners with Bill 100, the Supporting Ontario’s Trails Act, 2015. I hope that as members of the opposition familiarize themselves with Bill 100, they too will be in favour and vote in support of the Supporting Ontario’s Trails Act, 2015." ],

That is just not the way it should be, because the minister has been very, very clear—and I am going to read from it, if I can find it. I’ll find it, Speaker. The minister has been very clear—here we are—that this bill “would provide an option for willing landowners to consider entering into an agreement to allow some or all of their land to be utilized for trail-related activities.”", "He writes in a letter to the editor published in many newspapers across this province, “To be clear, an easement pursuant to Bill 100, if passed, would be a voluntary agreement between a landowner and an eligible body or bodies. No property owner would be compelled to provide an easement unless they agreed to do so.”", "This is entirely voluntary, contrary to some of the assertions of some members of this Legislature. I think it’s really important because we’re all—you listened to us—so proud of the trails in our communities. I’m going to talk a little bit about that. We’re so proud of these trails, I don’t know why anyone for political reasons would spread inaccuracies about what’s included in this legislation.", "This legislation is the result of extensive consultations. Over 250 groups across the province have weighed in. Unfortunately, instead of taking the time to understand this grassroots, ground-breaking legislation, the PCs—the opposition party—have shaped their entire argument around the opinion of one organization. Interestingly, several opposition members have supported—the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, I believe, supports this legislation and has said that publicly. Other members, too; the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington supports this legislation.

Speaker, I stand here in support of a bill that, if passed, will bring continued sustainability to our trail system and protect one of our province’s greatest treasures.", "My connection to trails is one that goes back to my childhood. My dad took us out on hikes. Every weekend, part of our weekend was spent walking the trails with my dad. In fact, he would say that his greatest accomplishment—he just turned 90, by the way; my dad, Don Matthews, just turned 90—was being part of something called the joint parks committee in London. This was a committee composed of the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority, the POC of the city of London and the Kiwanis Club of London. Those three groups got together and what they did is they got rights for trails that now run 30 kilometres along the Thames River, from one end of the city to the other end of the city, north branch, south branch and main branch.", "If you go out on there on a weekend—and I actually took my dad, because I wanted him to see what he had done. We sat on a bench and we saw strollers and wheelchairs and bikes and runners and joggers and any kind of transportation you can imagine. People were out enjoying the trails. That’s one of the great things that we can do in government: create that kind of trail where we can all enjoy the great outdoors.

The reason I was late was because this morning was the day when I hold my monthly seniors’ advisory group meeting. The topic for this morning’s meeting, coincidentally, was exercise classes for seniors. We had a number of special guests come and speak to the seniors and lead a class with the seniors on how they can remain fit—the kinds of activities and exercises that they can do to make sure that they’re as healthy as possible. This is something that’s important not only for seniors, of course; it’s important to people of all ages.", "One of the guests who came, just to give you a sense, was Alli Serguatis from the ESS Support Services group exercise program. She had a kinesiologist demonstrating exercises. We had Maria Kuntz from Bayshore Therapy and Rehab seniors’ wellness; Sandra Daniele-Socci from Edenbridge house; and Charlotte Rouse was speaking about exercise programs for seniors at the Islington Seniors’ Centre. These were the kinds of activities that were taking place at this meeting this morning.", "The reason I raise this is because, to me, the importance of exercise for people of all ages cannot be overstated. To me, one of the wonderful things about this bill is that this bill will allow us to strengthen what is a natural resource here in Ontario—one that we’ve built up over time, but one that flows from the beautiful landscape of Ontario, of our province, of our cities—and make sure that we give people opportunities to enjoy that landscape, to enjoy that nature, but also be healthier and happier.", "I’m not a big hiker myself, but I have at least a couple of friends who are. I know one or two who hike almost every week, and they drive quite a distance to do so. As someone who comes from a suburban community, I value those trails that are available to people close to home. In my community of Etobicoke Centre, we have some wonderful trails that neighbour the Humber River. I, myself, in growing up, grew up around James Gardens, which is a beautiful city park but also is adjacent to a trail that flows all the way along the Humber River. Those folks in Etobicoke who know Etobicoke well will know that it’s a beautiful part of our community. There are many others in Etobicoke as well.", "This bill does a few things that I think are important. It allows us to better manage trail activity and protect public land and property. It allows us to strengthen the consequences for trespassing on private and agricultural land. I think that’s important. I have spoken to constituents who have had people pass through a trail, and sometimes they trespass. Giving private landowners the protections that they need is also important. We all share responsibility in not only making sure the trails are available, but also respecting the rights of private property owners. So that’s an important component. Related to that, we’re increasing the amount that landowners can recover for damages caused by trespassers. I think that’s important.", "We’re going to establish a voluntary trails classification system. That allows trail users to have consistent information about the most appropriate trail and how difficult it is to navigate. I mean, I’m a novice. If I went hiking right now, I’d be hiking near the Humber River. I wouldn’t go out to the Bruce Trail because that, to me, would be a big step. Maybe eventually I’d get there, but for me, knowing how difficult a trail is, what I can expect, what precautions I can take—particularly if I were there with somebody younger or even a senior, I’d want to know what it takes to navigate that trail, not unlike what we do with ski hills when we go down a black diamond or a blue square. That helps me know whether I’m going to be able to navigate that and enjoy my time there. It recognizes Ontario trails of distinction to increase trail awareness.", "Speaker, I started by talking about fitness for seniors. I talked about the importance of fitness. I talked about the importance of enjoying our beautiful landscape here in our city of Toronto, but also across Ontario. I think this bill will help us do just that." ],

I will say snowmobiling isn’t that big down in my area. We don’t get an awful lot of snow, other than last night and maybe one other day in this past winter.

The concern with these kinds of easements is that they would give any body or group the right to access and use the trail, even though the permission to use it was only granted to one specific group.", "The minister has indicated that, well, this kind of an easement is voluntary, but why was this issue raised in the first place? We’ve had snowmobile trails for a number of years. I know a number of us in this House, when we were in government, worked with snowmobile associations. We helped them set up a protocol—helped them to organize, really, at a provincial level, and this was a good thing. I’d like to see more of this with the ATVs, for that matter.", "But by putting that word “easement” in here, it has cast doubt. It was a mistake to include that in the legislation. Obviously, there is a lot of confusion around that term with respect to a sport where landowners and snowmobilers got together, the same as we see with people on horseback and what we’re seeing with ATVs. It’s something we see with hunters. You get permission—not for seven years. It’s usually for the coming hunting season." ],

Second, the importance of the trails infrastructure in perpetuity: It’s a huge thing, from the perspective of tourism, small business, student employment, from anybody coming to the great area of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound and the Bruce Trail. Third, equally, is the active living, the ability to live healthy lifestyles, and encouraging and promoting—I’m a recreation director by trade, and I’m always going to be a person who’s looking for opportunities to keep our people healthier rather than trying to fix them once we allow them to go the other way.", "“The purposes of this act”—and I’m going to read them from the actual draft that is here—“are as follows:", "“(1) To increase awareness about and encourage the use of trails.", "“(2) To enhance trails and the trail experience.", "“(3) To protect trails for today’s generation and future generations.", "“(4) To recognize the contribution that trails make to quality of life in Ontario.”", "Those are four fundamental things that I wholeheartedly support, and I’m not certain how I could stand in this House and say I don’t support those.", "Equally, in his leadoff, Minister Coteau suggested—I did have a very good discussion with Minister Coteau—and I’m going to again read from this. This was (1), to advance sport and to move active lifestyles forward.", "(2) To support tourism dollars: “We know that trail tourism ... represents around 4% of our GDP in the province of Ontario. We know that tourism supports 350,000 jobs ... The trail tourism component of that larger $28-billion sector represents about $1.4 billion in economic benefits, and supports an impressive 18,000 jobs.”", "(3) To add clarity to the Occupiers’ Liability Act: “Currently there exists some legal ambiguity around what standard of care is owed to the users of trails. For example, if an ATV club charges membership fees for coordinating rides on a portion of an Ontario trail network, it is legally questionable what level of care is required from the business and from the owner of the trail. If Bill 100 is passed, it will clarify legislation, encouraging further participation between businesses and the owners of trails.”", "(4) To increase access to trails by protecting landowners: “Currently, if a hiker trespasses and causes significant damage to property, the landowner would have to file two court claims. If passed, Bill 100 would streamline that process....", "“Making it easier for property owners to recoup damages will increase the number of property owners willing to allow easements on their property.”", "The challenge that we’re all caught up in here is the poorly consulted, poorly executed rollout of Bill 100.", "Perhaps, had the minister worked with our critic Steve Clark from Leeds–Grenville, who has done a great job on this bill, we could have alleviated a lot of the concern out there. There are a lot of things: There’s misinformation and a lack of consultation, as I said earlier. They referenced that there were 250 groups that they had consultations with. It’s interesting that, again, the Ontario Landowners Association, to my knowledge, was not one of them. You would kind of think that that’s a fairly significant group that might have some concerns with this bill. Had they had open dialogue and consultation, we might have avoided a lot of this.", "There’s a lot of mistrust with regard to the Green Energy Act that was rammed through, and in the horse racing industry, for a lack of consultation. Seniors and prescription drugs—we just went through this. They went out and said, “We’re going to do this.” Today—and I’m thankful that they’ve actually reconsidered this—they’ve actually decided not to double the deductible. That’s a good step, but why didn’t they consult broadly and ensure that it was there before they ever rolled out that legislation?", "There are lots of unintended consequences that have already happened in my great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. I have people who are property owners who have had the trails come across their property. Because of misinformation, because this wasn’t clear and they hadn’t consulted broadly and widely enough, they have actually decided the trail is not going through. That’s going to have and has had significant, huge consequences, not just to the economy of my area but certainly to the livelihoods of some people and to the recreation and health benefits that I have mentioned.", "It has created bad property owner relations. One of the local snowmobile club members called me and said, “Bill, I have 29 property owners that I work with. I’m going to have to go to every single one of them.” They have their own form. They have it reviewed annually to make sure it’s a legal document and it works well. It actually provides liability insurance for the property owner, to ensure that if someone gets hurt while they’re utilizing their trail, they have indemnification and coverage. There’s a lot of misinformation, so there’s unintended consequences.", "People fear this bill creates unwanted or automatic easements, and takes away any property rights. We just heard from the Deputy Premier, who assured us this is voluntary. She tells me it’s in the bill. Obviously, there are people reading the bill who believe that they don’t see it as clearly as they would like. If she’s truly sincere to her word, and her government is truly sincere to what they’re saying publicly, then why would they not initiate the ability to have a review, do some wordsmithing and ensure that it’s crystal clear to the people that are opposing it? That, to me, makes sense. That’s why we as the opposition are here. That’s the democratic process. Certainly they have the right to bring a bill forward; we have the right to represent those users that come forward to us, asking for amendments. I’m certainly hopeful that that is—I believe it’s voluntary. I’ve been suggesting in my riding that it’s voluntary.", "Because of the way they have rolled this out, it’s pre-emptively calling off any verbal arrangements they have had with trail users. I have had, as I said, concern from snowmobile clubs in particular, but I keep reassuring them that you would hope, with good faith, that there is the opportunity to ensure that this is so.", "I am going to offer two quotes. One: “We have used this trail for over 20 years, but now neighbours are rescinding permission from here on. Trail use looks grim for the future.” It’s not a good place to be in, Mr. Speaker. It’s not good for any of us, and it could have been prevented.", "A second one: “Rescinding trails is what we want to stop.”", "What I hear a fair bit from people in my riding is that no one understands why the old system had to be tweaked. I’m going to step up and offer a couple of things that I believe. It’s the case, I think, that the minister has a duty to actually review and ensure that there is a trails plan. I’m just going to flip to that page: “The minister is required to maintain an Ontario trails strategy and must review the strategy and publish reports about the progress made in implementing the strategy.”", "I’m assuming the minister, as part of his mandate letter, thought that this was a good thing. He’s sharing that he consulted with 250 different user groups and that this was a good way to change. But the biggest issue here is about trust—not of the minister; I have found Minister Coteau to be a good guy. I can go and talk to him, he actually listens and we can work together. It’s mistrust of this government. Mr. Speaker, I’m going to be very specific: the Green Energy Act. My colleague the great member from Elgin–Middlesex–London, Jeff Yurek, has shared in this House today as part of this the reality of Dutton Dunwich, an unwilling host. They were assured that they would not end up with wind turbines, but the reality is that they are ending up with them. It’s about a trust factor.", "I’ve taken a bit of a leap of faith. In fact, I’ve taken a risk in my own riding. I wrote a letter to the editor to try to clarify some of the misconceptions and some of the misinformation that was out there, to ensure that everyone didn’t pre-emptively stop the use of their land, which really would negatively impact all of our trail users.", "Some have said to me, “Why, Bill, are you supporting Liberal legislation after all of the things that we can’t trust them on? Why are you supporting a government that has messed up so many things?” They said the gas plants would cost $40 million, and it ended up being a billion-dollar scandal for the taxpayers of Ontario. The Green Energy Act, again, the non-willing hosts that we’ve talked about so much in this House—and, close to my heart in my current critic role for seniors and long-term care, their commitment in two elections to redevelop 30,000 beds. Mr. Speaker, after 13 years, probably I think 15% would be a generous suggestion that they’ve got to. When I ask for the plan of when they’re going to build these beds and where, they don’t even have the ability to give it to me.", "I believe that what we need to do as legislators is to work to ensure that it’s the best legislation possible, that it’s actually in the best interest of all Ontarians—not for political partisanship, not because a minister wants it, but because it is the right thing to do. It really is a leap of faith for me, with their track record—their abysmal track record, frankly—on a lot of issues over the last 13 years. But, in this case, I believe it is a good piece of legislation. It can be improved, and I’ve asked for certain amendments. I’m going to talk about those a little bit later in my discussion. But the priority for me, in standing up the way I have, is because I believe that I need to be here and to make the health and the sustainability and the success of the people, first and foremost in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound but also across this great province, my priority. I believe that this piece of legislation, with some amendments, can in fact be a good piece of legislation.", "For decades, snowmobile trails have existed through partnerships between individual property owners and their local snowmobile club, utilizing written agreements from that property owner, or sometimes verbal. I believe, having talked to the minister and other colleagues of my caucus, that those can stay exactly as they are. If it’s been a handshake for 20 years, there’s nothing compelling anyone to do anything different. In the case of the snowmobile clubs, if they come along and they have their form that they have actually provided for you to provide indemnification, you can sign that with no fear that there’s anything else in there.", "An easement is a very specific piece of documentation. You, voluntarily, as the property owner, have to initiate that process. Yes, there are big concerns. A number of people have shared here that, as soon as you hear the word “lawyer,” as a property owner you start to worry. But, at the end of the day, this is a very significant piece.", "Minister Coteau has promised that “an easement pursuant to Bill 100, if passed, would be a voluntary agreement between a landowner and an eligible body or bodies. No property owner would be compelled to provide an easement unless they agreed to do so.” That, Mr. Speaker, is what I believe. I hope he stands true to his word and I hope his government stands true to their words.", "As I’ve shared, Ontarians remain at unease. Who can trust anything this Liberal government has had to say? I’m going to repeat: gas plants. They stood in this House and said that it’s only going to be a $40-million-dollar mistake; it was a billion dollars, Mr. Speaker. What could we have done with that billion dollars for the less fortunate, for education, for our young people that are just starting out in life, our health care system and our long-term-care beds that I bring up? It’s regrettable.", "Promoting the use of trails is good for tourism, good for people’s health and well-being. Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound has a multitude of trail experiences: ATVing, cross-country skiing, equestrian riding, mountain biking, snowmobiling, trail running, snowshoeing and the Bruce Trail. The Bruce Trail is 890 kilometres long, connecting communities from Niagara all the way to the tip of Tobermory in my great riding—960 property owners actually give access to that trail. Trail use in my riding alone generates over $24.5 million annually between the two counties.", "We’re asking this government to get out there, to truly consult all user groups and all stakeholders and fix the mess that they’ve created with miscommunication—or at least, not as clear as they could have been in their communication. The trail sector may be at risk of actually collapsing. We want to challenge this government to give faith to the people of Ontario that you are here to do the right thing, to accept improvements, to work collaboratively and to create the most effective legislation possible—not just buzzwords, but truly engage with the opposition, with the third party and with those people that we represent in the stakeholder community.", "There are two key issues that I have already shared here. The first is that voluntary component—those easements. The Deputy Premier suggests that the OFA suggests that there’s wording in there that they’re okay with. That’s okay. I respect greatly the OFA and the membership of the OFA. But that doesn’t mean that that appeases all groups or that it makes it right. There are other groups that obviously have some concerns. So why would you, as a government, not be willing to engage with other people and bring their thought processes to the table?", "A favourite phrase with this government is, “We want to consult.” Well, there are groups out there that feel that you haven’t consulted enough, and they want to offer you their opinion. They want very specific—one group in particular in my riding, the landowners group, I’ve asked to put their very specific concerns in writing, the exact wording that they want, and I’ll hand-deliver it to the minister so that there can be no confusion on what’s being expected from a stakeholder that I represent.", "The other one is transferability, the ability for an easement to be assigned by an eligible body or group to another eligible body. As has been explained to me, there may be groups that exist today and it might be that you transfer it from a snowmobile club to an ATV club, because lots of things change. But there could be a group that comes along, and you need some control of who that will go to, because it could be a group that doesn’t even want trails. So there has to be some wording in there to be able to control that. It can’t just be an automatic transfer. I think that if we can find wording to do that, we can certainly appease some people.", "This has been a very interesting one for me. I’ve shared already that, in my own riding, I’ve been challenged by people who are my supporters, who actually elected me. They said, “Bill, why are you standing up and supporting this government?” I shared with them that Randy Hillier, a member of my caucus, a former president of the landowners association—and I’m paraphrasing, but I believe the words he used were, “I’ve been here for a lot of years. I’ve read a lot of legislation.” He believes fundamentally that this is a good, solid piece of legislation. Can there be improvements? Absolutely. There can be to any piece of legislation.", "My colleague from Timiskaming–Cochrane, John Vanthof, raised a good issue a little earlier with regards to a very specific situation. Where there is a group, for example, a snowmobile club, that wants to put a bridge on a property owner’s land—they’re going to invest whatever the number may be; let’s just say it’s $80,000, and they’ve done that voluntarily in the past—what happens if that landowner decides tomorrow, for whatever reason, “I don’t want you coming across my land?” Now there’s an $80,000 asset that’s of no value to anyone. That’s the whole intent of the easements.", "The word that I believe my colleague Mr. Hillier used was that it provides “certainty” for all groups. You can voluntarily, if you want to, have an easement that specifies a very specific period of time, very specific terms and conditions, and yes, if you’ve entered into that and three years down the road you sell your piece of property, the new landowner is certainly going to have to honour those easement conditions, terms and all of the restrictions that may be in there. But again, that’s certainty for the group that’s investing that $80,000, perhaps half a million dollars, in whatever that improvement or enhancement to that trail would be. I don’t see anything wrong with that because it remains voluntary to the property owner. It’s crystal clear for everyone: If you’re buying that piece of property and there’s an officially registered easement, you know exactly the terms and conditions that you’ve bought that property on. It’s not something where someone can come along and say, “Oh, no. Me and Bob had our own little handshake discussion and this is really what was intended.” It’s black and white, and it’s there for certainty for all users.", "Mr. Speaker, I think what we want to do here is ensure that, at the end of the day, we look for some of the positives as well, when people say to me, “What’s good in this bill?” Well, at the end of the day, there are some changes in here with regard to fines and rehabilitation.", "Section 69.2 is added to the act. If a person is found guilty of this offence, a court may, in addition to imposing a fine under the act, order the person to rehabilitate the lands and repair any damage to crown land or property. So if a bunch of people get in there, let’s say on motocross bikes, and rip up the farmer’s land and they’re caught trespassing, not only can they be fined now, they could actually have to spend some money to rehabilitate that land. I don’t see why that would be a bad thing from a property owner’s perspective, so I see that as a plus.", "Part of the credit should go to my colleague Sylvia Jones from Dufferin–Caledon. Her bill, Bill 36, Respecting Private Property Act, 2014, asked for increases to the fines. Currently, a person who is convicted of trespassing under subsection 2(1) of the Trespass to Property Act is liable to a fine of not more than $2,000. An amendment provides that the person is liable to a fine of not more than $10,000. The cost of doing some of this stuff, the challenges that people are facing—because of her efforts to bring in her legislation, we have actually increased those fines.", "Under subsection 12(1) of the act, a court is permitted to award damages against a person convicted of trespasssing under subsection (2), but the award cannot be for an amount in excess of $1,000; there’s an amendment to remove the $1,000 limit. So again, Mr. Speaker, it might be a $5,000 or $8,000 actual impact. This ability is in there, so I think that’s a good thing to actually be in the act.", "I think the key comes down to, again, that this is a piece of legislation where this government had an idea, and I think the intent is right. I believe that the minister and the government—I hope the government—wanted to improve the trails and ensure their sustainability, and they know and have realized the economic and health impacts and just the reality of what happens when you have access to such a great trail network. A number of our colleagues here have worked on ATV bills to try to make that industry even more successful and accessible for people, and I think that is something we want to do.", "I believe that if they had consulted more broadly, if they had ever actually brought a piece of legislation and let us look at it before they brought it to this House, particularly a bill that, for the most part, impacts a great deal of rural and northern Ontario, we might have been able to suggest those thoughts and we wouldn’t be having this debate right now, because it probably would have sailed through with the support of all three parties.", "Mr. Speaker, the economic benefits, the health and environmental benefits, the social and the heritage benefits of all trails in communities in Ontario are what I am standing here trying to promote today. I’m going to ask the minister and I’m going to ask this government—I will vote in favour to get it to second reading and expect the minister and the Deputy Premier to honour what they have said, that there are reasonable amendments and input from stakeholders, the two being that, again, the voluntary component from the easements has to be put in very explicit black and white, to the satisfaction of all user groups, and the transferability assigned by an eligible body or group to another body or group needs to be massaged to ensure that the intent is truly honoured.", "The Deputy Premier said in this House, “We want to make it better.” Here’s your chance, Minister. Here’s your chance to restore faith in the people of Ontario that you’ll actually stand behind your word, you’ll accept improvements and you’ll make this legislation the best it can be." ],

I’ll tell you why towards the end of this presentation.", "Maybe my friend from Ajax–Pickering, Mr. Dickson, has already had his snow machines out today, enjoying this spring surprise, as I know he loves his trails.", "Speaker, as you know, Bill 100 is legislation proposed to amend the Ontario Trails Act. It’s an act that has already caused alarm for many people. It’s been said that’s because there was not enough consultation on the bill before it was introduced. That led to rumours and uncertainties. Alarm bells have sounded throughout the farming and agricultural communities, and with landowners who have questions about how this bill could impact them and the quality of life of their families.", "There was no reason for that. It has already led to a war of words between some landowners and organized trail users. Because of this, access agreements, or easements, between snowmobiling clubs and some landowners have been terminated. Some trails are being closed.", "The intent of the bill was to promote tourism and make trails more accessible and yet, in certain areas, because of the ambiguous wording in the bill and uncertainty about the meaning of the legislation, we are seeing nervous people hunker down rather than welcoming this legislation with open arms.", "My good friends at the Ontario Federation of Agriculture have concerns. They want the bill to be amended so that if people trespass and are convicted, the fines imposed will be much higher than proposed. The OFA wants stricter police enforcement of the act as well. My buddy Don McCabe, the OFA president, has said this bill does not encroach on the freedoms of individual landowners. He’s also been quoted as saying there’s a bogus rumour out there claiming farmers risk having their land expropriated for trails, and that is not true. I read somewhere recently, maybe it was in the London Free Press, that the executive director of the Ontario Trails Council is of the opinion that it could take years for the misunderstandings to be cleared up.", "There is a good deal of ambiguity in the section dealing with easements, and it has raised red flags with all kinds of people.

We have work to do in this bill—a lot of work—to smooth over the troubled waters, if you will, because so far, what has been put on the table has proven too bitter for many people. That is unfortunate. We want more trails to be available. We want people to use them. If we cross-country ski or snowshoe, it keeps us healthy.", "There’s a pretty famous quote out there from Raymond Inmon. It goes: “If you are seeking creative ideas, go out walking. Angels whisper to a man when he goes for a walk.” Now, I’m sure they whisper to women as well, but the quote given just mentioned a man, so don’t blame me for that.", "We all know more trails, be they for walking or sledding or skiing, lead to more tourism. Tourists spend money and local communities then do better, and I think we can all agree, we want more communities to do better in Ontario.", "The bill has problems. Let’s hope they’re not insurmountable. Having said that, let me turn my attention to trails in general, not necessarily the ones running along or through farmland and not necessarily the ones frequented by people on snow machines. These have value and are appreciated by many of us as well.", "I live on Blue Heron Point in east Windsor, on a manmade pond, one of those that collects stormwater runoff. We have swans, geese, ducks, turtles, koi, carp, snakes, frogs, ring-necked pheasants and songbirds galore. I have a wonderful walking trail right outside my back door. I’m told when you walk the trail all around the pond, you’ve walked a mile. The trail is full of people all the time, and more in warmer months, obviously, but every day of the year there’s a steady parade of passers-by, joggers, cyclists, folks on Rollerblades and skateboards, mums, dads, grandparents, grandkids, and neighbours just out for a walk with their dog.", "We have a wonderful trail system in my area. We have a hill just south of Blue Heron pond. Trails run up and down that hill, all around the base, and not far away, the eight-kilometre Ganatchio Trail is a two-lane, paved pathway. Speaker, in case you were wondering, Ganatchio is a First Nations name for Lake St. Clair.", "One of the most beautiful trails in all of Ontario, I believe, would be the riverfront trail in downtown Windsor. It’s more than five kilometres. It runs along the Detroit River. Most of it is in Windsor West. I have some of it in Windsor–Tecumseh. At one end you have the University of Windsor and the Ambassador Bridge, at the other Olde Walkerville and the Wiser’s distillery, and in between the award-winning Odette outdoor sculpture park and our beautiful Dieppe Gardens, which, because of the bend in the river, puts us due south of Detroit.", "Now, I know and you know that we in Canada call our American friends our neighbours to the south.

To the east of Festival Plaza, along the Riverfront Trail, we are very proud of an elaborate fountain and reflecting pool named after Bert Weeks, a former mayor. Toronto has David Crombie, who wanted to save the waterfront here; well, we had Bert Weeks, who did save our waterfront. He led the fight to keep our waterfront open and free from high-rises and crass commercial developments. It was a successful struggle and our waterfront is open, free and accessible to all.", "Between there and the distillery is the Joan and Clifford Hatch Wildflower Garden. Mr. Hatch was a former Canadian owner of the Hiram Walker distillery and a great supporter of Windsor’s waterfront renewal project.", "The Great Western Railway came to Windsor in 1854, the same year we were incorporated as a village. Much of our waterfront in subsequent years was overrun with train tracks and cross-river railway barges. We honour that heritage with Great Western Park, next to the Hatch wildflower garden. The tracks are gone, as are the railway barges.", "The Riverfront Trail, with the skyline of Detroit as a backdrop, may be our most popular trail.

As a matter of fact, I was still on the AMO board when we voted to hold this year’s annual conference in Windsor.

The greenway is the southernmost portion of the Trans Canada Trail. As you know, the Trans Canada Trail is the world’s longest network of recreational trails. Work on that network began nearly 25 years ago. Eventually it will stretch for 24,000 kilometres, from the Atlantic to the Pacific and up into the Arctic waters.", "That’s not the oldest trail by any means. My good friend from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound would be the first to tell us that the Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked footpath. It follows the Niagara escarpment for 890 kilometres and has another 400 kilometres of associated side trails—but, Speaker, I took one of those associated trails there for a moment, so allow me to get back to Windsor.", "We also have the Little River trail and trails along the McHugh, west Windsor, south Windsor, central, Devonwood, as well as Southwood Lakes.", "I can appreciate the concern some people have with trails and I would hope the government can clarify for them what the impact of this bill will be. On the one hand, we hear the legislation takes snippets or provisions from nearly 50 other pieces of legislation and puts it all into one coherent set of rules. On the other hand, we have those concerned with the rights of landowners, who see the proposal as an infringement on their individual property rights.", "I even read in the Pembroke Observer that the president of the Renfrew Landowners Association has raised the alarm that the government was out to take away privately held land and force rural landowners into urban areas. That’s pretty scary stuff, Speaker. I would hope no member of this House is feeding into that scenario.", "I’ve mentioned before, I believe, that I was born in St. Martins, New Brunswick, a long time ago. I was down there again just before Labour Day last year. The government is making great strides in developing the Fundy Trail, which starts just outside of St. Martins. It has, at this point, something like 23 scenic lookouts. You can explore four secluded beaches.", "Eventually, the Fundy Trail, alongside the world’s highest tides, will stretch all along the coastline to Fundy National Park, near Moncton. I don’t know if it will ever rival the Cabot Trail and the highlands of Cape Breton, in Nova Scotia, but if you’re ever down that way, Speaker, check it out. St. Martins has two of the beautiful and historic covered wooden bridges, and it is a very picturesque little village.", "I mentioned the highest tides in the world. Speaker, at one point, you can step off the wharf onto a lobster boat and, a few hours later, come back when the tide has gone out, and that boat is now resting 40 feet below, on the clay seabed. Forty-foot tides: quite an amazing sight, as are the natural caves and stony beaches. But again, Speaker, I digress.", "I want to come back to Bill 100 and some of the problems associated with the proposed legislation to enact the Ontario Trails Act.", "Sometimes I wonder—I really do—why we do things in this House the way we do them. For example, in schedule 1, the minister is clear, very clear. The act reads, “The week beginning on the Monday immediately before the first Saturday in June in each year is proclaimed as Trails Week.” That’s clear to me. The Monday immediately before the first Saturday in June each year is when we recognize the beginning of Trails Week in this province—the Monday immediately before the first Saturday in June. Now, Speaker, it’s clear to me, and I hope it’s clear to you and the rest of us here in the chamber this afternoon.", "So why, pray tell, Speaker, does the next line in this bill state, “The minister may, however, declare that Trails Week begins on any other day of the year.”", "Who writes this stuff? Do they get paid by the word when they write it? Charles Dickens started his Tale of Two Cities with this: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness....”", "Talk about foolishness. Are we trying to pull a Dickens here? The week will start on this date—or not. It will start whenever the minister wakes up in the morning and says, “I’m going to start Trails Week today.” Give me a break.", "Give me legislation that makes sense. Give me definitions that I can understand. Tell me in no uncertain terms what an easement is and what an easement isn’t. Don’t give me the “nudge, nudge, wink, wink” bill. Give me the handshake bill, and make it clear and not subject to interpretation.", "The week begins every year on the Monday immediately before the first Saturday in June. I get it. I don’t need this: “The minister may, however, declare that Trails Week begins on any other day of the year” he deems it. That goes to the credibility of the bill. That sets the stage for all that follows in this proposed legislation,", "One could argue that’s why this bill has been so badly received, so poorly reviewed and so roundly criticized.", "You want trails of distinction? Give me words of distinction. Give me words of distinction in this legislation. Be distinct, be clear, be upfront, and be respectful of the people who will have to live within the terms of this legislation.", "You didn’t consult with them on the actual wording. You didn’t ask for their input on the actual wording before the bill was tabled. You weren’t listening then. The larger question perhaps is, are you listening now? Will you amend this bill? Will you improve this bill? Will you go out and clarify what this language means? Maybe then, we could have a real conversation with all of the parties concerned and a new Trails Act that does everything it’s supposed to do, not one that is as messy as the roads outside today.", "Speaker, maybe I did jinx us. As I said when I began this presentation, I put my snow shovels away a couple of weeks ago. I know I shouldn’t have; I should have listened to Robert Frost. In his Two Tramps in Mud Time, from 1926, he wrote:", "The sun was warm but the wind was chill.", "You know how it is with an April day", "When the sun is out and the wind is still,", "You’re one month on in the middle of May.", "But if you so much as dare to speak,", "A cloud comes over the sunlit arch,", "A wind comes off a frozen peak,", "And you’re two months back in the middle of March.", "That’s what it feels like today, and it looks like that in downtown Toronto—like the middle of winter as opposed to the beginning of spring. It’s baseball season. The Jays won yesterday, for God’s sake. Those with snowshoes got around easier today than the rest of us.", "Trails get us closer to nature; they get families out of cities into small towns and villages. We get to enjoy the woods, see wildlife close up, maybe see the stars—really see the stars—for the first time without the neon lights or the street lamps interfering.", "Trail life can be an adventure. Let’s hope we don’t share the same experience that the Nunavut MLA who just spent eight days lost in the far north had. Pauloosie Keyootak went off on snow machines for a tour of his riding with his son and a nephew. They got lost in a blizzard in one of the most forbidding environments on earth. Fortunately, they were able to build an igloo with a small knife and survived in minus-30-degree temperatures. It was a good thing that they were also able to shoot a caribou. They had just run out of supplies and were rescued at a good time.", "Sledding on trails can be dangerous. That’s why it’s important to carry a GPS or emergency locater. Cellphones don’t always work. Most of the trails in our part of the country aren’t as hazardous as those farther north, but they can be just as dangerous at times. I’m not a big sledder myself, but I understand the thrill of it all, the connection with nature and the exercise component.", "We should be able to work together to fashion this bill into a coherent piece of legislation that can be taken to the public—and why not take it to the public, as opposed to making them come here to Toronto to speak to any amendments? Take it on the road. Take it to northern Ontario—the northeast and the northwest—and take it to eastern Ontario as well. Listen to those who will be impacted. Listen to their concerns. Assuage their fears, if you can. Clarify any misunderstandings. Consult, consult, consult, then make changes to the wording. Make it work; make it a piece of worthwhile legislation. Clear up any ambiguities. Maybe we’ll see more trails opened up, maybe we’ll see a boost in tourism and maybe we can get back to the good-neighbour policies that used to exist between individual landowners and the trail riders’ associations.", "Thank you, Speaker, and happy trails." ],

It’s fascinating to hear what you all have to offer. There are some members, however, who have tried to assert that Bill 100 is unnecessary and unimportant. I want to challenge this. As you heard earlier today, the relevance of the bill is in part to protect landowners and trail organizers. It is offering clarity on this issue of the duty of care. What is that? If you are an owner who is offering up your land to a trail organization, you should have a lower level of care, meaning that you’re not going to be legally responsible for the maintenance and the safety. By doing this, it’s going to encourage more landowners to offer up their properties.

I believe that in this bill, unfortunately, because of the—people were consulted as the government was preparing this bill, but then when the actual wording came out, it led to a lot of confusion, a lot of mistrust and a lot of misunderstanding.

As the member from Ottawa–Orléans, I want to take a moment to speak to the importance of tourism in Ontario and how trails and tourism interact. Each year in Ontario, tourism contributes over $28 billion of economic activity and supports over 350,000 jobs in Ontario. In Ottawa, tourism helps to fill over two million hotel room nights. That’s $255 million in revenue for our local hotels, our hotel chains and in more spending from our visitors.", "We know that trail tourism supports 18,000 jobs across our province. If passed, Bill 100 will provide additional supports for our trail system and give the province additional tools to help market trails across this wonderful province of ours.", "I want to refer to a few of the trails that I would like to highlight in terms of being, almost, trails of distinction. That would be maybe trails like the Rideau Trail, a 387-kilometre network of interconnected hiking trails between the city of Kingston and the city of Ottawa, located in the general area of the Rideau Canal and its tributary waters. The Rideau Trail crosses terrain ranging from placid farmland to the rugged Canadian Shield. Or trails like the Cataraqui Trail, which stretches 104 kilometres from Strathcona to Smiths Falls on a trail that crosses the UNESCO Frontenac Arch Biosphere. Cataraqui Trail was famously an old railway bed before volunteers turned it into a trail.", "Both of these trails—both great Ottawa trails, if I may say—have one thing in common: The continuation of both trails is entirely made possible by the generous permission of both private and public landowners. We know that Bill 100, if passed, will provide greater protection for landowners by lowering liability and by streamlining the process of claiming damages from trespassers. We know also that Bill 100 provides landowners with additional tools to provide trail users access to their land.", "We know that trails stimulate economic activity by attracting tourism businesses that are associated with outdoor activities and regular recreational users. In communities, they benefit restaurants, local businesses, retail stores and accommodations. In particular, trails can be beneficial to the economies of smaller, rural, northern and remote communities, where economic opportunities may be limited.", "A number of studies report on the economic benefits of trails, and I would like to highlight some of them. The Ontario trail survey, 2014, estimated the economic benefit of hiking in Ontario at almost $1.4 billion for that year. In 2011, 7.2 million Canadian visitors participated in a trail activity during their trips to Ontario, spending $1.3 billion. That’s actually 8.7% of total visitor spending by Canadians.", "The Eastern Ontario Trails Alliance manages 2,370 kilometres of trail and has 25,000 users who spend $6 million annually, generating an economic impact of $2 million per year. The Trans Canada Trail, when complete, is expected to generate $2.4 billion in annual economic impact.", "I also want to talk—and we heard a little bit—about snowmobiling. I would say this was almost a part of my growing up. My family owned a cottage property and we used to go snowmobiling. I really enjoyed this. I think that provides a way for Ontarians to explore the vast backyard of the stunning scenery of our wonderful winter. In fact, in Ottawa–Orléans I have snowmobile trails, and this hobby creates significant economic activity. If I look at Ontario, snowmobiling generates an estimated $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion per year. In summertime, the trails are used by ATV enthusiasts. In 2005, ATVing generated an estimated $6.2 billion", "I also would like to talk to you about benefits. When you talk about economic benefit, the Great Waterfront Trail Adventure event on the Waterfront Trail in 2011 involved 125 riders biking 730 kilometres in eight days and spending $73,000 on food and accommodations alone.", "Trail activity: We heard the member who sits beside me, who’s a doctor, talk about the impact and the benefit of trails from a physical activity perspective. It certainly can combat the economic burden of physical inactivity and obesity, estimated at $7.9 billion, according to 2009 data. The members of this House may find it quite interesting to learn that the medical benefits in costs saved as a result of trail use are almost three times greater than the costs of the trail construction and maintenance. That means that for every $1 investment in trails for physical activity, it leads to $2.94 in direct medical benefits.", "As much as we can talk about the economic and the health benefits, I want to address a few issues that were brought throughout this debate this afternoon. As we continue the debate with my colleagues, our members will also clarify the portion of Bill 100 that speaks to trail easements.", "Our Supporting Ontario’s Trails Act, 2015, if passed, will allow for the establishment of a voluntary classification system and will provide users with a more holistic perspective of the Ontario trail network. That will help stakeholders promote trails more effectively and ensure consistency across the province while increasing trail awareness and local tourism.", "In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, this legislation will help sustain our trails and those who allow the use of their land as part of our trail system." ],

Certainly, I don’t think any one level of government can take all the credit for it. I don’t think any one generation can take the credit for it either, Speaker. It’s been a cumulative effect of people who have taken the interest to make sure that the next generation has the ability to explore some of the wilderness areas, the green space areas of this province, and to get into areas that perhaps they wouldn’t typically have access to.", "I’ve been surrounded by trails all my life, Speaker. For the past 30 years, I’ve lived right on the Waterfront Trail that goes along the GTA. People who are out for a stroll, and maybe walking from Hamilton to Mississauga or from Hamilton to other areas, walk right past my front door. It’s something that I’ve just become accustomed to and it’s something that I am very proud of.", "I also don’t live very far from the Bruce Trail, Speaker. Certainly, if there is a trail that has become famous around the world, it’s through people who try to hike the entire Bruce Trail. They start doing little segments, and the idea is that you do a little segment at a time, and eventually, over the years, you find out you’ve covered the entire Bruce Trail. It’s an area that’s famous, certainly beyond Ontario’s borders, and beyond Canada’s borders as well.", "I come from a community, Oakville, which takes its trails very, very seriously. As I have said before, it’s because of some of the people who have come before. I think of Mayor Harry Barrett. Oakville used to be a community where there were a lot of large waterfront estates that were right on the lake. You had the Eaton estate, you had the Hindmarsh estate, the Bailey estate, all sorts of large tracts of land that eventually, over the years, because of economic pressures and other reasons, became areas where people decided to build smaller homes. They became subdivisions, basically. Mayor Barrett said, “When we’re taking our parkland dedication, we’re going to take the part along the waterfront, the part along the lakefront.” At first, when he tried it a few times, I think people thought it was a futile exercise to try to return the lakefront to Oakville. In the fullness of time, however, it has proven to be one of the best strategies that’s ever been employed by the town of Oakville. I think right now, as we speak today, Oakville has got back about 40% to 50% of its waterfront along the entire length of the town.", "So, Speaker, there have been people that have come forward, I think, on a regular basis and have kind of reminded us that we need to do something and that we need to leave the world a better place than the one we found. A way we can do that is through our trail strategy.", "Speaker, we have a family cottage. It’s about 200 or 300 yards off C trail. Those of you that snowmobile will know that C trail is the equivalent of the 401 in snowmobiling. It’s where all the other routes branch off. Basically, I can go 100 yards on my snowmobile, 200 yards beyond C trail, and I can get to just about anywhere in this province: I can get to the state of Michigan; I can get to the province of Quebec. It’s because people in the past—and the incredible volunteers that I buy my trail passes from every year, the incredible volunteers in the snowmobile clubs around this province.", "I’ll tell you that I like going to the cottage in the summer, but I like it even better in the winter because I can get to places on my snowmobile that I would never get to in the summer because of either bugs or the swamps aren’t frozen. When the swamps freeze up, you can get back into lakes that you simply could never get to in the summer. So we owe an awful lot to the people who work on these trails on a volunteer basis and also, I think, the people who designed the trails in the first place.", "Speaker, in your chair, we used to have a gentleman; his name was Mike Brown. He was the former Speaker and also the MPP for Algoma–Manitoulin. What he would do is that, every winter, he would organize a tour around the areas of his riding. The idea was to bring us southerners up from the south to understand what the economic impact of snowmobiling was on ridings like Algoma.", "When it snowed, there was all sorts of economic activity. The restaurants were open; the cleaners were in the hotels—everything that goes along with people visiting. When there’s no snow, those people get sent home. There’s no other economic activity. I think, in the south, we truly underestimate the impact that trail systems have on the province of Ontario and its economic activity.", "Like the member from Ajax–Pickering, Joe Dickson, I am a sledder and an ATVer, and the odd weekend now that I can still find some time to get up to the cottage, I take advantage of it.", "It’s a pleasure to go into the ridings of other members—like the Seguin trail. The Seguin trail runs out of Parry Sound and winds its way into Huntsville. It’s an old train track. A train used to run along there. It’s as straight as an arrow. They’ve taken the tracks up. You can just go along there. The animal life along there is incredible. You end up at the tavern in Sprucedale, and often all the bike clubs come together in there, and the ATV clubs come in. There’s not much in Sprucedale until you get a bunch of clubs coming in there at the same time.", "Speaker, I think we owe an awful lot to the people who came before us in designing the trails in this province.

There’s not just the so-called tree huggers that are doing this. Really, it’s good business.

There used to be a whole series of electric railways running through the whole city of Toronto. They were called beltlines. Kay Gardner had a vision that this old beltline that goes from Mount Pleasant Cemetery, in the east, all the way to the Keele-Black Creek corridor in the west—that that abandoned line could be turned into a linear park.", "It took her about 10 years. Eventually, the city of Toronto dedicated that abandoned rail line, the beltline railway, into a city park. Today, in the wintertime—it is winter today, I guess. In the summertime, there are thousands of people who walk and cycle along the Kay Gardner Beltline Park. If you ever go up Yonge Street, just south of Davisville, you can see that her name is on the bridge overpass: the Kay Gardner beltline. That was the dedication and the vision of one person, who was way ahead of her time. They said they couldn’t do it, and it was too complicated, but she did it.", "I think this is what this Bill 100 is.

It’s a testament that when we work together, we can accomplish great things. That organization worked really hard, along with the municipality, and the trail is a true testament to their work. I think that with the trails act, again, if we work together, we can accomplish great things.", "There are a few things in the trails act that need to be changed so that people fully understand what we’re all trying to do. I’ve heard a lot of good things in this House. The stuff about the easements has to be clarified.", "I think another issue that would go a long way is that when people sign an agreement with the snowmobile club to allow the use of their trail, that isn’t sliding into an easement—that there are two distinct things. It’s either you sign this, and this gives you full control over your land, or, if you want—and there are cases where an easement makes a lot of sense. Where a bridge needs to be constructed or where you want a long-term agreement, an easement makes sense. But there has to be a clear delineation between an easement and a right to use the property. It’s the little things like that that we have to make sure are included in the text of the bill, and that will go a long ways.", "I’ve heard some good things from all sides. I’ve heard some movement from the government. I think today was a really good day, as far as debates go in the Legislature. because I think we did have a true debate about how to make this work better. I sincerely hope, if and when this bill passes second reading, that that true debate continues and we actually come together to make amendments to make this bill what it could be—a bill that benefits all the trails in Ontario and all the landowners who participate." ],

Hopefully, the legislation will be looked at as a way of trying to mitigate those competing interests for the best of everyone. That is not an easy thing to do, but I think overall the attempt here is essentially to try and bring greater coordination, greater definition, let’s say, to a lot of these complex land issues, severance issues, easement issues—I should say more easement than severance.

Well, you know in time there’s AD and BC. Well, I go back to about 1968 BT; BT is before trails. All we used to do was go down the roads and maybe cut across a farmer’s field somewhere. We’d go curling in a little town called Brussels. A bunch of us would take off. Or we would go into Listowel or south into Mitchell or into Monkton—that’s Monkton, Ontario—on our snowmobiles.

They blew up about every 20 hours, so you had to keep a supply of pistons around. We all had to carry spark plugs and froze our hands off changing spark plugs and whatever else because they would foul up if we didn’t have the gas mixed just right.", "But that’s before we had trails. One of the reasons they started the trail system was not only the popularity of snowmobiling—which was very popular. Through the 1970s and 1980s, they started building these trail systems. It was a safety thing.", "Two of my neighbours, if you look at them carefully—and they’re people my age—have cuts across here, right across their face right to their ears. In fact, there was one guy decapitated one year. That’s from running through fences. Barbed wire was the worst, but a page wire fence would do a lot of damage too. We had windshields on the snowmobile; it would bring that wire right up here if you were a snowmobiler. There were some pretty serious accidents with fences, because back then—I’m going back into the late 1960s and early 1970s—farms still had fences. They don’t have them anymore because the farms have got so big that cattle and the like are all kept inside pretty much or within a limited pasture area.", "Something had to be done because people were getting hurt. You can imagine being 10 or 15 kilometres away from a small town or a hospital and a bunch of snowmobilers dealing with somebody who has been very badly injured, because the loss of blood was incredible when this happened; they probably lost teeth and everything else when that fence went into their mouth. It was a desperate situation.", "They started to embark on a trail system. They started to embark on asking farmers for their permission to use lands on their farms so they could have these trail systems. I know that where our farms were, we had a trail going through it. The first year wasn’t too successful—it was back in 1975, I think, that they had a trail by us—because of some abuse, littering the trail with different things and whatever else.", "All we had to do was go talk to the organizers of where they had made the trail and say, “Look, we’ve had some issues with this. If you guys still want to have the trail through our property, clean it up.” And they did. They were very apologetic. There were a few bad actors who made the issue, but the people involved—it was the Kinsmen Club in Moncton, actually—came out and they cleaned it all up.", "That’s goodwill on their part and goodwill on our part, and that’s the way it was done. It’s still done to this day, where they mark the trails now. I think a lot of us have seen the way they mark trails. There’s an agreement there with the farmer, and it’s usually done with a handshake or just saying, “Yes, this is what’s going to happen”—nothing written down—that they will look after those trails and they will keep them clean. Any bad actors will be either kicked off the trail; or the OPP, who are around our area and, I suppose, around other parts of Ontario, will go after them because they are out there on their snow machines too, riding the trails looking for impaired drivers, littering and that type of thing.", "That’s the trust that farmers—that property owners; you don’t necessarily have to be a farmer—property owners have with the people that build these trails and with snowmobilers and people who use ATVs. You go up to the Bruce Peninsula. We have a place up there near Lion’s Head. I’m about two miles from the Bruce Trail, and it’s the same thing. The Bruce Trail, where I am—you certainly couldn’t take an ATV or a snowmobile up there. You have to walk it and crawl up rocks and everything else. But people don’t abuse the trail. They keep it clean. There are stations around. There are volunteers around that help with this. I have seen a couple of bears there, which was interesting. They looked at us, and it was sort of, “Well, you go your way and I’ll go mine,” and that was the way it ended. But it was quite interesting to see these animals out on the trail.", "As I’ve said in some of my comments this afternoon, it’s a trust between the groups that want exercise, the groups that want to snowmobile, the groups that want to four-wheel or ATV—a trust built up between landowners and themselves that has been going on for, gosh, I don’t know, 30 years, 40 years maybe.", "Now we get a piece of legislation, rightfully or wrongfully, that has been portrayed to landowners as, “Uh-oh, here’s a problem, and it has to do with easements.” As I have said earlier on this afternoon, this didn’t have to happen. If it had been portrayed properly, we probably wouldn’t have had the issue we’re having out there right now.", "The people who have called me—and I have gotten I don’t know how many phone calls into the office, I’ve gotten letters into the office, from our regular farm owners, property owners and snowmobile clubs. The government says they consulted with the snowmobile clubs. Well, they didn’t talk to the ones in my area; they didn’t know what was coming. I have had property owners call up, and they said, “We don’t want anything to do involved with government anymore,” so out come the stakes.", "We didn’t have a great year this year for snowmobiling. I think they only had about a day and a half, and that was the end of it. But they’re not going to have it next year because these farmers have pulled these stakes out. They say, “We don’t want anything more to do with government red tape. We’re tired of it. We don’t trust them because of things that have happened in the past.”", "Now, instead of increasing the size of our trails or maybe having more trails, we are going to end up with less or you’re going to have trails cut up so you can’t go across one property; you have to stop and go around it somehow. I don’t know how they’re going to do it. They’re just going to mess the whole thing up.", "It’s too bad. When we have a good, snowy winter where I live, you’ll see people coming up from the south that don’t have the snow, don’t have the conditions to snowmobile or ATV, and at dinnertime or lunchtime or suppertime they’re packed around the restaurants. There might be hundreds of them in there. They’re going to the restaurants; they’re buying our food; they’re buying our gas—whatever they’re doing. Some stay overnight at the local motels that we have around the area. This is money coming into our economy in Perth–Wellington, and now here’s a chance of really messing it up unless the government backs off a little bit, just like they have done with the seniors’ drug bill, where they’ve put it off a little bit: “We’re going to just back off a little bit here and put it on pause.”", "Maybe that’s what we should have done with this bill—and for the government to truly get out there and consult with the very people that these trails are impacting. I hope the government would consider that because I know that if this gets to committee, whatever the opposition asks them to do, because they hold a majority on committee, is not going to get listened to, as we’ve seen in the past with other committees where we sit there and ask questions and maybe throw an amendment or two into the bill, and guess what happens? We’re ignored.", "The frustration level that you see in rural Ontario with this type of thing is high. It’s very high. I would hate to see people that enjoy the sport—they spend thousands and thousands of dollars on these snow machines. That little one I had: I think it was about 200 bucks when I bought it or something like that. It wasn’t very expensive. It was a used one. You can spend $10,000 on these machines, or even more. You can get power steering on them now, which I thought was kind of neat—and hand warmers and whatever else. You can hardly get cold on snowmobiles.

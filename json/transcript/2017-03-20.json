The advertising in question explicitly envisions a timeline and outcome for legislation which has yet to be introduced in the Legislature.", "As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, the most recent edition of Erskine May describes contempt as follows:", "“Other acts, besides words spoken or writings published reflecting upon either House or its proceedings which, though they do not tend directly to obstruct or impede either House in the performance of its functions, yet have a tendency to produce this result indirectly by bringing such House into odium, contempt or ridicule or by lowering its authority, may constitute contempts.”", "Indeed, Speaker Stockwell cited exactly those passages when ruling on the most relevant precedent faced by this Legislature as it pertained to government advertising in the case of municipal reforms to the city of Toronto in 1997. In that case, Speaker Stockwell laid out a very strict two-pronged test for whether government advertising which presumed an act by the House could be deemed a breach of privilege and a prima facie case of contempt. To quote Speaker Stockwell:", "“However, I am very concerned by the ministry pamphlet, which was worded more definitely than the commercial and the press release. To name but a few examples, the brochure claims that ‘new city wards will be created,’ that ‘work on building the new city will start in 1997,’ and that ‘the new city of Toronto will reduce the number of municipal politicians.’”", "Speaker Stockwell goes on to say, “How is one to interpret such unqualified claims? In my opinion, they convey the impression that the passage of the requisite legislation was not necessary or was a foregone conclusion, or that the assembly and the Legislature had a pro forma, tangential, even inferior role in the legislative and law-making process, and in doing so, they appear to diminish the respect that is due to this House. I would not have come to this view had these claims or proposals—and that is all they are—been qualified by a statement that they would only become law if and when the Legislature gave its stamp of approval to them.”", "That is why, in all of our releases, both sides of the House to this day from that ruling, we all say “if passed by the Legislature.” This advertising makes no mention of “if passed by this Legislature” in any of its forms, whether in social media or the radio.", "The two prongs laid out by Speaker Stockwell are whether the claims are definitive and unqualified, and whether they presume an act of the House before the House has had the ability to offer its approval to them, thus relegating the Legislature to a pro forma or inferior role in the legislative process.", "On both tests, it appears the Ministry of Energy has committed a prima facie case of contempt.", "The advertisement at question not only definitively states the result of legislation, “25% off your hydro bill,” but also presents an unqualified timeline, “starting this summer.”", "By both committing the House to a result and a timeline, the minister has satisfied the first test of making definitive and unqualified claims.", "With regard to Speaker Stockwell’s second test regarding whether the statements regulate the Legislature to a pro forma or inferior role in the legislative process, in the technical briefing provided recently to certain members of both the opposition and third party, a document from the ministry was provided which stated, “The government intends to introduce legislation that would, if passed, enable ... (IESO) and ... (OPG) to work together to refinance the GA over a longer period of time. The legislation would also outline the role of the ... (OEB), as it relates to the financing proposal.”", "The government, under direction from the Ministry of Energy, therefore admits that legislation is necessary in order to enact the changes—so we’re not talking about regulations here—which changes what it has already begun to advertise as though they were already scheduled to be enacted. As of today, no such legislation has been introduced in this House, and the government has not reached out to members to even indicate when such legislation may be forthcoming. Thus, the government has admitted that legislation is necessary to bring the changes into effect, but has assumed that such legislation has already passed in its advertising, thereby committing this Legislature not only to a result, but to a timeline and forcing it into that inferior position in the legislative process that Speaker Stockwell outlined in his ruling of January 22, 1997.", "Mr. Speaker, I ask you to refer to my written submission of this morning that further details and supports a case, I believe, of prima facie contempt." ],

The first is with respect to the issue of members’ abilities to perform their duties, and the second is with respect to the government’s implementation of policy.", "Firstly, it is of utmost importance that the definition of “privilege” in this case deals with interference with the proceedings of the Legislature as laid out in the October 17, 1980, ruling by the House of Commons Speaker Sauvé. There is no proceeding in this House upon which the member for Simcoe–Grey may state as being obstructed.", "If there is to be a bill on this matter, that would be a different situation. The examples stated by the member are all cases in which there was already a bill before this House. We have no such bill before the House and, accordingly, there is no proceeding to obstruct.", "The question is whether, should a bill be introduced, the members in this House would feel constricted in their abilities to duly debate the matter before the House. That is a question for the future and not privilege.", "Given that there is no bill or proceeding before the House, the very premise of privilege does not exist.", "I do believe, Speaker, that you yourself will find the summary of the May 11, 1998, ruling of this House in which the Speaker said that such advertising does not amount to an “attempt by improper means to influence members in their parliamentary conduct....” They do not impede freedom of speech in this House, nor in fact do they relate to a particular proceeding currently before us.", "Secondly, Speaker, the government reserves the right to implement its policies as it so chooses. Should a sudden change arise and the government can enact its measures without legislation, then the government is free to do so. The intention to table legislation is not the same as the requirement to table legislation.", "As announced on March 2, the government is committed to a plan that will lower electricity bills by 25% on average for all residential customers across the province, and will also benefit half a million small businesses and farms, an initiative we had hoped the opposition would support.", "As part of its function, the government has a responsibility to raise awareness and communicate information about programs and services that affect Ontarians. This includes informing Ontarians of changes to their electricity bills so that they can use this information to plan for the future as they manage their household budgets.", "In the alternative, I submit that the member’s timeline is not entirely complete either.

The tragedy resulted in injuries sustained by 28 people, and, sadly, one man passed away from his injuries.", "In my community, it never takes long for everyone to swing in to help. The first responders, like the Ontario Provincial Police and Frontenac paramedics, rushed to the scene, and my understanding is that many of the victims were decontaminated at the Leeds-Grenville fire station before they were sent to Kingston General Hospital. A decontamination tent was set up in a very short period of time, and many workers at KGH stayed late, worked through their breaks and even came in on their day off to care for those who needed it.", "This tragedy saw our community come together as other local hospitals, like the Hotel Dieu and Providence Care, extended their hours and offered beds to support KGH in dealing with this tragedy. The McMaster emergency room even responded by offering to send pizza to the workers as they cared for the patients.", "The men and women who worked tirelessly during this emergency and worked to support front-line staff are some of the finest. In fact, each one is a hero in my community. It is my honour to rise in the House today to acknowledge them and thank them for their services.", "Thank you all for your seamless, compassionate and heartwarming response to what could have been a much worse tragedy." ],

I received great feedback and promised to bring their concerns to the floor of the Legislature. As such, I rise today to urge the government to make seniors’ access to long-term care a priority.", "This morning I also joined the Ontario Long Term Care Association as they announced that 11,000 concerned Ontarians had signed their petition to call on the government to commit to better seniors care. This is evidence of the fact that this government has seriously abdicated its responsibility to properly fund long-term care, leaving hundreds of thousands of seniors to go without the care they need and deserve.", "The fact of the matter is that the wait-list just hit a new record high, with 26,500 seniors across Ontario going without a long-term-care bed, a number that will double to 50,000 in several years. Yet this government refuses to commit to adding new beds to accommodate this growing need.", "The fact is that one in five seniors in long-term care are malnourished because of chronic underfunding by this government. I don’t know how this government can sit back and watch the grey tsunami coming at it and not address it.", "My constituents, as well as every one of the 11,000 Ontarians who signed the petition, believe that long-term care is going to only get worse unless the government takes action now. I believe our seniors deserve better: They deserve better care, better services and better standards, especially in food and hydro.", "I take this opportunity to thank everyone who signed the petition and for doing their best to support our seniors, and I call on the government to do the same by taking action on those needs in long-term care." ],

Since we last met to discuss Bill 65, the safer schools act, I have had the opportunity to have further discussions with stakeholders on this important legislation, hear their concerns, of course, and drill down into the bill a bit more. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to share some important points here and to hopefully find a more effective way forward that respects our municipalities and the average law-abiding driver here in the province of Ontario, while making our school zones safer places for our children and youth.", "When we talk about the driver, they’re constantly under attack by this current government. I did a presentation recently to an automotive industry group and we talked about the array of fees—the increase in drivers’ licences. Of course, we still have the outdated Drive Clean program, which has outlived its usefulness. It’s still a bit of a cash grab for those who are celebrating their birthday or renewing their vehicle registration.", "The most recent one was with regard to the tolls on municipal roads. The government at the time supported tolls until, similar to their hydro scheme, they were polling and saw how negative an impression this had on them, and of course they backtracked on the tolls. But now we’re here today, talking about photo radar.", "I want to follow up where I left off the last time I spoke. I had really just finished discussing some of the history of automated speed enforcement, or photo radar—I like “photo radar” because I think it’s easy; the government, of course, is talking “automated speed enforcement”—and all the concerns that parties have had at some point or another.", "I’d like to point out that even the current Minister of Transportation was making headlines just over two years ago that read, “Photo Radar Not Coming Back: Del Duca,” which showed up in the Toronto Sun, the London Free Press, up in Sudbury and all over Niagara Falls. In that particular article, the minister, who is headlining this latest photo radar initiative, was quoted telling reporters that during his mandate as minister “the province doesn’t have an interest in returning to photo radar.” He said that back on March 9, 2015. So when you hear the minister indicating a lack of interest, maybe you can better understand why the first directive this legislation makes is not an effort to improve safety, but a direction to eliminate the name “photo radar” altogether in favour of “automated speed enforcement,” as if the change of name makes the idea of unmanned photo surveillance any easier to accept.", "If you check the legislation, right under the title, subsection 1(2) reads as follows: “Subsection 7(11.1) of the act is amended by striking out ‘a photo-radar system’ in the portion before clause (a) and substituting ‘an automated speed enforcement system’.”", "I don’t see the point in playing with the wording here if the real intent is protecting our kids in school. People know and understand what photo radar is, and renaming it simply is not going to change that.", "In the end, it doesn’t really matter what you call it; the concerns for photo radar remain. In fact, just last year, a Postmedia survey indicated, “Nearly 60% of us in Hogtown”—or Toronto, for those that may not know that nickname—“have no desire to see the return of photo radar....” So 60% of people polled by this survey said that in Toronto, we “have no desire to see the return of photo radar compared to just 28% who would welcome the hidden cameras that snap pictures of speeders’ licence plates so they can be sent tickets in the mail.”", "Again, while we have come two decades since the last photo radar fiasco, the program still has a bit of public relations work to do. There certainly continues to be a lot of negative connotation around automated speed enforcement, and very legitimate grievances against it. So we need to be very deliberate in considering those concerns before giving municipalities the ability to use photo radar.", "Despite the obvious shared commitment to ensuring and enhancing safety for children, parents and teachers alike, those concerns for the photo radar proposal that we see today are rampant. They are rampant, Speaker, due to the fact that this current proposal is written in a way that leaves so many questions unanswered, questions like these: Will school zone enforcement be 24/7, or is it to be just during school hours? Where will signage be placed? What happens to actual police enforcement, which we know is critical still, in our communities—to enforce poor driving behaviours in addition to speeding? Will motorists get tickets for going one kilometre over the limit, or two kilometres or three kilometres? Who gets the ticket: the driver or the owner of the vehicle?", "Speaker, I haven’t even got to our overwhelming concerns regarding open-ended community safety zones.", "On that last question of who ultimately receives the ticket, I know that our friends at the Ontario Trucking Association, while they have noted support for Bill 65, are in fact looking for some answers. Specifically, they’ve indicated they’re hoping to work with the ministry on addressing issues related to who the penalty is actually targeting.", "As they note, fines are issued to the owner of the vehicle and not the driver who committed the violation. Consequently, photo radar would do little to alter behaviour and would likely not be viewed as a deterrent, if the monetary fine is not applied to the actual violator. Also, if speeding violations are not assigned to drivers and subsequently shown on the drivers’ CVORs, the ability of trucking companies to manage the safety risk associated with making new hires could in fact be compromised.", "They have an excellent point. Ticketing the owner of the vehicle is just the first step and does not address the fundamental cause of speeding. It is a slap on the wrist. Most drivers probably won’t even take the time to think about whatever moment in time two weeks ago, or maybe even longer, when they were in fact speeding. They’ll just pay the ticket and move on.", "In cases where the owner is not the operator of the vehicle, which could be a family or industry, we get even further away from solving the problem. Families that lend the car out to their teenaged kid are probably going to just pay the fine for them, eliminating accountability, while, on the other hand, businesses will be on the hook for penalties because their employees broke the law.", "Now, there are options to circumvent these concerns, but we don’t see them listed here in Bill 65. We could follow a similar path to Australia and New Zealand, for instance, and require that the registered owner of a vehicle identify the driver of the vehicle at the time of the offence. There are safeguards that can be built in to protect against false identification of a driver.", "To be clear: If enhanced safety and traffic-calming measures like photo radar are to have their desired effect, we need to ensure that speeding violations are attributed to the right person. Otherwise the effect will be lost.", "It does not help our society change the behaviour of speeders or help industries hire safe drivers when we are not assigning tickets to the actual motorists. So, while I’m hoping the minister will be open to answering the OTA’s call to work on addressing just who Bill 65 is in fact targeting, if we don’t look to providing answers to the serious questions that this government’s photo radar act has brought to light, we run the risk of running a program of diminishing returns when it comes to safety while government coffers continue to grow—a cash grab, of course, by any other name, Speaker.", "Those concerns become even greater when it comes to the lack of answers for questions surrounding what level of speed violation will actually lead to a ticket. Just take the city of Edmonton, for example, where there was an online petition with 20,000 signatures against the growing number of tickets given to those travelling just slightly over the speed limit. In a letter to the Edmonton Journal in 2012, former city commissioner Philip Walker wrote that a “grace” given to speeding motorists had been changed, and that while people were once informally allowed to go 10 kilometres an hour over the limit before being charged, that had been cut to six kilometres an hour.", "Are we really trying to ticket people going five or six over the limit—two or three, even? Is that the point of this bill? If not, is there any indication in the legislation guarding against what many would consider an obvious cash grab? Will motorists receive tickets for going, as I said, one, two, or three kilometres over the limit? I think it’s important that we protect against these issues, with this government’s photo radar bill being little more than a cash grab.", "If there was any doubt about the “cash” part of the plan, the numbers reflect the concern. For instance, those in Ottawa monitoring outcomes have noted the statistics between 2011 and 2014 between photo radar in Edmonton and no photo radar in Ottawa. The results are startling. In cities of similar population—Ottawa and Edmonton—records indicate that 10 times the number of tickets were recorded in the photo radar municipality than in the one without photo radar. Here’s the main point of concern: The jurisdiction with photo radar—the city of Edmonton—not only had 10 times the number of tickets; they also saw more accidents, more deaths and more injuries compared with Ottawa, where no photo radar existed.", "As I noted when we launched debate, our former Solicitor General Bob Runciman captured this concern back in the days of the NDP’s failed photo radar mess. He indicated here in the House, close to two decades ago, “We have deemed photo radar to be primarily a cash cow for the NDP and not really having a meaningful impact in terms of road safety.” That quote two decades later perhaps is still justified.", "Today, when it comes to concerns or questions about photo radar programs, are they having an effect on improved safety, and at what cost?", "As recently as in a 2015 research paper by Pierre Desrochers, Speed or Greed: Does Automated Traffic Enforcement Improve Safety or Generate Revenue?, they concluded that despite the use of photo radar in several major Canadian cities, it has shown little credible evidence of actual effectiveness. There are, of course, many studies out there indicating the opposite, but that’s why it’s so important that we ask those two key questions—“Is it improving safety?” and “At what cost?”—to ensure that when we cut to the bottom of all the studies and rhetoric out there, we are improving the safety of our children in school zones.", "It’s all about safety, Speaker, and in that context, I would like to look at the impacts regarding actual police officer enforcement. Do we really want to reduce police presence around our schools? Unsafe driving is characterized by much more than just being over the speed limit: drinking and driving; weaving; driving without a licence or insurance; not obeying road signage and red lights; texting while driving is still one of the leading factors in accidents and deaths by motorists here in the province of Ontario; impaired driving—alcohol and now, of course, we’re seeing the legalization of marijuana use—impairment by a drug substance is also a leading factor and being abused every day, in fact, by motorists who make that tragic decision to get behind the wheel after a night out with friends.", "I did a statement just recently in the Legislature about a terrible accident on Highway 7/8 just outside of Kitchener-Waterloo. A family was travelling home after a day with family. A woman and her son were in the back seat, driven by the father. A drunk driver came up from behind, hit them, and the mother lost her life; the child is still recovering in hospital. So as we continue to become educated, we are continuing to see people make bad choices and those, unfortunately, happen in and around school areas.", "I remember back in the days when we had a hydro outage in our subdivision, there was a guy coming home from playing baseball through the day, and he took out about four or five vehicles. He was impaired, and this was right in the middle of the day. So these things are actually happening. All of these driving behaviours put Ontarians in jeopardy and can’t be thrown under the umbrella of speeding.", "Police provide a vital service in protecting our school zones by deterring and stopping these offences. A box on a pole does not replace a police officer. That is incredibly clear. Beyond the amazing work our police service does in providing mentorship guidance and support to our schools, their presence and their visibility is still crucial to keeping our school zones safe.", "I know for me in my subdivision, at J.W. Gerth school, I’ll tell you—in the morning my son gets on the bus, but often I drop off my other son at daycare, and it is a zoo around the school, people trying to park or drop kids off. You’re not looking at the ability to speed much, just because of the sheer congestion and chaos happening in and around the school. Oftentimes the regional police are there simply to provide some guidance and deal with aggressive driving. That’s important, to see the actual police presence in those school zones.", "So police on site will always be a greater influence in changing driving behaviour than automated speed enforcement that sends a ticket to your door weeks later. Beyond stopping speeding drivers in the moment, police often uncover further violations during these speeding stops, like intoxicated drivers, as I mentioned, or those who are driving without a licence. The personal interaction an officer has with a driver they have pulled over is an opportunity for them to make a personal connection and leave a lasting message with that driver about how their actions were detrimental to the community they are in and endangered some of our most vulnerable persons. That is the importance of having law enforcement out there on our streets every day, dealing with behaviours as they exist, not 30 or 45 days after the fact.", "So, of course, while photo radar may have some benefit in reducing the burden on the police service, it is not a replacement for officers and the many direct and indirect benefits that having on-site police officers bring. At best, it’s a supplementary tool.", "As Chris Lewis, former OPP commissioner, has stated in the past, “Traffic enforcement—including photo radar—needs to be about saving lives by changing driver behaviour and/or removing the habitual offenders from the roads by suspending their driving privileges. The ultimate goal is to see police never having to lay a traffic ticket, because everyone is obeying the laws and people are not getting maimed and killed through vehicle collisions. That wouldn’t bolster municipal government revenue streams but it would save a pile of lives and reduce the number of grieving families.”", "If we are talking about improved road safety due to the reduction in traffic stops on the roadside,again, in the context of this bill, this is not a benefit. You want there to be police on hand to make traffic stops when there is a dangerous driver in a school zone. It’s questionable that the issuance of a ticket automatically from a photo radar system weeks later protects the children in that school zone at that moment. There is no question as to the protection that an on-site police officer could provide. These same concerns have been noted time and again.", "In fact, while we are considering today’s Wynne Liberal government proposal—it wasn’t that long ago when the McGuinty Liberals floated the photo radar trial balloon in its early years, prompting our safety groups, like even the CAA, to indicate in 2004 that “photo radar is nothing but a ‘tax grab’ that does nothing to slow speeding drivers.”", "Then-CAA spokesperson Mark Arsenault indicated that “While a marked police cruiser on the side of the road does slow traffic, drivers won’t be deterred by receiving a ticket in the mail weeks after speeding past an unmarked photo radar van.", "“‘The only way that this is going to save lives and improve traffic safety is if there’s a deterrent involved,’ he said. “‘Photo radar doesn’t provide that.’”", "Now, Speaker, I think I can safely say that we all support deterring drivers who are violating speed limits around children. We also understand the need to give municipalities the tools they need to maintain a high standard of speed enforcement, while allocating police in a way that takes advantage of their training to the most benefit. But the concerns I’m raising need to be addressed. Photo radar is not a stand-alone enforcement method. At best, it is a complementary tool to the very important work police do.", "I just don’t want to see this bill, and photo radar, suddenly become a reason to see less police in our school zones, especially during times where there is high foot traffic, just before and after school starts, when families are bringing their kids to school for the day.", "I’ll tell you, in my subdivision, when I see a cruiser coming in around our court—I love seeing the police in our community. I don’t get a chance to see them enough—maybe that’s because I’m not home all that often—but I am refreshed to see a cruiser at least doing a patrol. Last week, I did see them dealing with aggressive driving in our subdivision. Of course, most of them are our neighbours, who should know better, but it is great to see police actually in our communities.", "I was talking to some of my colleagues earlier and they noted, down south, for instance in Florida, that enforcement mechanisms that the police do in and around school zones are intense. They don’t have photo radar, but they have aggressive patrolling by actual law enforcement. And people darn well know, especially during school hours, if they’re entering a school zone, if they’re not following the speed rules, that they’re going to get pulled over by a trooper or a police officer in the United States. I think that they handle things slightly different than they do here in Ontario.", "Interruption." ],

It’s crucial that we continue to have that police presence, in conjunction with photo radar. I can certainly see that helping us cover more ground in protecting our schools.", "I want to reinforce, we, as the official opposition, led by Patrick Brown, are adamant: We need to do anything and everything to make our school zones safe, for the sake of our children, their brothers and sisters, and our families. We need to do everything we possibly can to keep them safe.", "That said, Speaker, given the high traffic times identified by the York study and given our shared aim to protect our children and their comings and goings from school, I continue to look to the minister to address the issue of timing; that is, does the photo radar as outlined in Bill 65 snap pictures all day long, or just during school hours when the stated aim of this bill is most readily achievable? Again, if government is proposing a 24/7 photo radar surveillance system, it again highlights questions as to whether the true aim of this bill is to keep our children safe or to keep the fines revenue flowing in. Which one is it?", "Perhaps during their response, they can answer that question. That would be number one: Is the true aim of the bill to keep our kids safe, or to keep fines flowing in—didn’t get the tolls; said yes to the tolls; backtracked on the tolls; said no to the tolls; now you are saying photo radar. Is it about the money or is it about safety?", "Again, I think we can all understand the need for safety enhancements for children during the school day. I know, myself, as a father—and I did highlight this not too long ago. My son Murphy is five and is now off to school, and loves getting on the bus. His brother, Lincoln, can’t wait to join him on the bus next year. I am out frequently, when I’m at home, to be able to take him to the bus. It’s unfortunate that we have seen a couple of incidents that were close calls. Soon after they got off the bus one day, a young kid in a vehicle actually passed the bus. Now, the bus had just started to take off—signs came in, and passed the bus. That was pretty scary. I don’t know if the driver would have been speeding at that point—possibly—but that is an example of when I would have loved to have had a police officer close by because he or she would have dealt with that behaviour right then and there. A ticket, potentially, 45 days down the road given to the parents wouldn’t have connected the behaviour challenge at the time with the infraction.", "I will commend my seatmate and colleague from Chatham–Kent–Essex, when it comes to school safety. It’s something that we encourage the government to adopt. A lot of motorists are in fact passing or blowing by school buses when they have their stop arm out. Of course, my colleague has a bill brought forward. This is the second time now we’ve debated it. It passed second reading; it’s in committee. It’s a great initiative when it comes to actually keeping kids safe. I welcome the government to adopt an initiative like that. We asked for them to do that in Bill 31. They didn’t do that. We wish they would have, to allow for photo evidence to be used when people blow by school buses. I think it’s such a practical solution to an actual, major problem we have in the province when people are blowing by school buses when their signs are out. This bill has been a long time coming. The government didn’t adopt it in Bill 31, but, again, initiatives like that, to keep our kids safe, are actual changes that we need to do.", "Again, Speaker, we understand the need for enhanced safety on the roads when it comes to children in school zones, and I want to reinforce that all day long. It’s the related, unanswered questions pointing in other directions where we continue to have concerns. I will say, right here and now, that what is most concerning is this legislation’s direction when it comes to the creation of the undefined designation of “community safety zones.”", "Speaker, while the government has chosen to identify Bill 65 as a Safer School Zones Act, they’ve attempted to hide the fact that in addition to school zones, according to the way the legislation is currently written, photo radar could be implemented pretty much anywhere a municipality sees fit to place it. That is a problem.", "To make it clear, with Bill 65 as it is currently written, the Wynne Liberals are ushering in legislation that could put photo radar cameras on highways right across this province. While they make a good show of speaking to the need to have safer school zones, when you read to the bottom of the bill you realize quickly that school zones are only a small part of an initiative that will see expressways and parkways throughout the province hit by photo radar. That’s a throwback to the NDP days where we saw photo radar right across this province.", "Specifically, Bill 65 indicates that, “An automated speed enforcement system may be used in accordance with this part and the regulations made under it,", "“(a) in a community safety zone designated by bylaw....”", "So just what is a community safety zone? Perhaps question number two for the government: During their rotations, maybe they can actually answer the specifics on what a community safety zone actually is.", "If you check section 214 of the Highway Traffic Act, you get a bit of an eye-opener. The HTA indicates that, “The council of a municipality may by bylaw designate a part of a highway under its jurisdiction as a community safety zone if, in the council’s opinion, public safety is of special concern on that part of the highway.” The translation is: Community safety zones are anywhere a municipal council says they are. There is no definition, no standards and no regulations. Basically, Bill 65 allows municipalities carte blanche as to where or what a community safety zone—and, therefore, a potential photo radar zone—actually is.", "Now, I know many of you probably haven’t read this bill. I’m hoping you’re listening clearly with regard to this one-hour debate. I think many of you tomorrow in caucus will say, “Guys, I listened thoroughly to the opposition yesterday”—that being today—“and his arguments on Bill 65, and I am concerned that this bill forgets about school safety zones and potentially creates a major problem for all of us now that photo radar could be back on Ontario highways.”" ],

That’s a dangerous amount of power to hand over.", "Look, the reality is that municipalities are desperately looking for new revenue mechanisms as a result of chronic Liberal underfunding, and we’re always open to discussion on how to make school zones safer.

But we need the assurance that they will continue to be used in responsible, sustainable ways that don’t punish good drivers on the local parkway.", "We can already see this kind of concern on the overextension of community zones, even though the legislation has not even passed.

Just days after Bill 65’s announcement and there are councillors out there, already eager to see where they can place what may be little more than a cash camera.

There is Allen Road, here in Toronto—most people probably are familiar with it—from Eglinton Avenue West to Transit Road only, a municipal road; Black Creek Drive, Toronto, from Maple Leaf Drive to Weston Road, the compromise for the cancellation of the Highway 401 extension; Burlington Street, Hamilton, from west of Kenilworth Avenue to the QEW only; and the DVP, the Don Valley Parkway, here in Toronto—a municipal highway—from the Gardiner Expressway to Highway 401. The entire length of the DVP could in fact be a community safety zone designated by the council in a bylaw, with photo radar flashing all the way down it. They said no to tolls, but they’re going to get it on the photo radar.", "Dougall Parkway, Windsor, from Howard Avenue to Highway 401 only—and the government is saying, “Oh, look. Even if we do put in photo radar, nobody will get tickets because it’s a parking lot.” You know, that’s a problem in itself that they haven’t addressed for 14 years. That’s a poor excuse perhaps for saying, “Don’t worry. Even if we put photo radar on, you’re not going to get a ticket, because you’re parked all the time.”", "E.C.

These are highways that the government wants to now put photo radar on.", "I think one of the first things we should do in committee is just change the bill title from Safer School Zones Act to the photo radar cash grab act—that’s what we should change bill title to—because it’s being hidden by the fact that they want to put these up in school zones.", "Look, we agree with keeping our school zones safe and any measure that will keep our children safe, but what they’ve done is they’ve taken advantage of the goodwill people have for keeping our kids safe and have now extended the ability for photo radar to be on our highways—photo radar back on our highways.", "Back to Hamilton, an interesting note on the proposal: If approved, this community safety zone and photo radar would be placed on the two parkways in Hamilton that the Minister of Transportation denied permission for photo radar use on last year. The very roads that he said no to, he’s now saying yes to through his own bill. I just don’t get it; I don’t understand. The ministry can talk about empowering municipalities and providing tools all at once, but you have to wonder about handing the power to the cities to place photo radar systems on roads that were just denied that permission after assessment by the Ministry of Transportation.", "The fact is that there needs to be a serious discussion as to what a community safety zone is and how photo radar would work in that zone before government should ever be considering signing off on such a massive transference of power. Speaker, there are no parameters on the size and extent of community safety zones, nor is it explained how roads or groups of roads are dealt with. Any number of streets in a given area could see speed reductions, including ones that would not be clear targets of the designation. Would all roads in the community safety zone be covered by photo radar, if implemented, or only specific roads chosen by the municipality? What sorts of measures are going to be put in place to warn drivers that they are entering a community safety zone while travelling along the same road that is in a community safety zone at one point and out of it at others? There are just too many questions to be asked at this point, and seemingly no answers from the government.", "Look at the region of Waterloo. We’ve got three cities: Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo. You’ve got King Street that runs through all three. One could be designated a community safety zone in this part; Kitchener may not; Waterloo may not. That creates a massive problem right across the province by having this hodgepodge of inconsistencies from one municipality to another.", "On the last point, warnings for drivers and signage, here, too, the issue of community safety zones looms. We could have situations where a roadway may not be designated as a community safety zone in one municipality, as I mentioned—possibly King Street—but then when a motorist crosses over into the neighbouring municipality, they are in the zone, subject to photo radar and possibly immediate reduced speed limits. You could have photo radar set up in one community that’s about two kilometres over. You’ll get a ticket. The next one is four kilometres. The next one is five or six. It’s a complete mess.", "We could have situations where a roadway may not be designated as a community safety zone, again, in one municipality. These constant speed changes on the same road make it unlikely a driver will be able to notice and react to speed threshold changes multiple times. Are the cameras going to be on the perimeter of the zones or are they to be placed throughout? Again, when it comes to issues of signage, where will signs be placed, and how often? What will they indicate?", "Speaker, when it comes to Bill 65’s direction on photo radar for community safety zones, I think it’s glaringly obvious that much more work needs to be done before this legislation is ready for prime time. It’s just not ready for prime time. It’s bad. And until the government is prepared to remove or define just what a community safety zone is, I think it’s safe to say that we aren’t prepared endorse a “photo radar anywhere” approach—not us. I think the real question here is why the minister didn’t stop at school zones. Had he, we would have likely not even be standing up talking for an hour on this today. Why, if he really wanted to make safer school zones, as the bill’s title suggests, didn’t he stop at school zones instead of opening the door to implementation of photo radar on highways right across the province of Ontario?", "Speaker, there are many questions we need answers to, including 24/7 enforcement, signage, in-person police enforcement, the minimum speeding offences to be ticketed, and who gets the ticket. But the fact is, while we await those answers, the addition of undefined “community safety zones,” allowing photo radar anywhere in a bill purported to create safer school zones, will continue to be problematic until it is addressed.", "Do you know what? This is the second session of Parliament. This is the minister’s—I think he’s going into his third year as minister. I know he was handed down Bill 31, a safe roads act, a multi-pronged bill that our opposition supported—a lot of mechanisms, in fact, from our members: slow down, move over; increased fines for impaired driving—a lot of great road safety initiatives. There were others that we wanted to include in that bill, including, from my colleague from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, a fine if you’re not properly clearing off your truck and snow comes off. A lot of accidents have happened like that. I talked about the safety camera bill that my colleague from Chatham–Kent–Essex put forward to protect school kids on buses and to penalize those who continue to blow by buses.", "Of course, I put forward my Safe Roundabouts Act, something that I think keeps our community safe by injecting rules into the Highway Traffic Act and actually clearly explaining what roundabouts are. That was a good bill. I know that that was adopted from another minister—I think maybe even two. I would have hoped that the minister would have brought something more substantial for our roads to keep people safe in the province of Ontario on our roadways, including schoolchildren. This is what he brought forward. He brought forward a Safe Schools Act that purportedly attempts to protect our kids in our schools, and we were absolutely supportive of that portion of it. But then he goes and he adds this craziness of putting photo radar on highways to simply create a cash cow on drivers’ backs. That’s what he has done here. I would have thought there could have been something more substantial for him to bring forward, but he’s probably being forced by the Premier’s office to table a bill like this because she said no to the tolls. They’re having to come up with something to appease those they’ve already offended by recently saying no after they had said yes. They come back and they say, “You know what? We’re going to increase the gas tax.” Well, they actually thought they were getting that too. They thought they were getting the tolls and the gas tax increase. Now they’re only getting the gas tax increase, and that’s years down the road.", "So they said, “Well, look, we’ll bring in this bill. We’ll call it the Safe Schools Act. We’ll play people for the fact that it’s going to help our kids in school zones,” which we hope it will, and we support that part. “But we’re going to fool people and trick them by adding photo radar on Ontario highways right across the province. That’s where the actual money is.”", "Again, while we all support enhanced safety for our children—and I want to reiterate that, and our leader, Patrick Brown, will constantly talk about that—we need to think long-term about what makes areas high-collision zones or more likely to have speeding drivers, and think about more concrete changes that can solve the problems, like intersection engineering and design that provide a solid solution.", "Speed of traffic is definitely a concern, yes, but we also need to be thinking about driver error and how we can change roads to prevent driver error leading to collisions. A driver leaving the road, taking a left turn across a path, stop-sign violations, disobeying traffic signals, failing to yield to pedestrians, aggressive driving, driving without a licence, driving while impaired due to substance or alcohol: These are all problems that photo radar does not solve and are potentially more dangerous to our children and other vulnerable persons than someone going a few kilometres over the speed limit. These are offences that need a police officer and real, substantive thought on how we can better design our roads and intersections.", "And while we are thinking about it, the minister may want to think about if he really wants to address school safety or if he’s more interested in opening the photo radar cash register on highways right across the province. Because that, ladies and gentlemen—and again, I hope that there is a fruitful conversation tomorrow in the Liberal caucus room on Bill 65. I know they probably sold you on the fact that school safe zones were all about the kids and school zones, but it’s not; it’s about all of those municipal highways in the province of Ontario becoming a photo radar cash register.", "So we’ll be waiting for the answer, Speaker. I thank you for that hour. I will thank those who are at home watching. We’ll continue the debate and listen to the answers the government has." ],

In Waterloo region, I have been in touch with many of our local municipal leaders: our regional chair, Ken Seiling; Kitchener mayor Berry Vrbanovic, who I know is a friend of the member for Kitchener–Conestoga—they went to school together; the mayor of Waterloo, Dave Jaworsky; and our chief of police, Bryan Larkin. Let me tell you that all of them have been very vocal; they are very much in favour of Bill 65, and I hope that the member for Kitchener–Conestoga is aware of that. These municipal leaders and many mayors and councillors and chiefs of police right across the province have spoken to us at AMO and at ROMA. They’re advocating in favour of Bill 65. They want to slow down speeders.", "In fact, Mayor Jaworsky told me just this past weekend at an event that we attended together—he said, “You know, Daiene, there are some streets in Waterloo region”—and this is on the outskirts—“where speeding is a chronic problem.” He said, “We simply cannot afford to have police at every single street.” He said that having the automated speed enforcement cameras is a way of controlling this. He said, “Imagine if, on one or two occasions, you receive in the mail one of these costly tickets.” That’s what it’s going to take to change behaviour, and that’s what we’re looking forward to.", "While the member for Kitchener–Conestoga has been repeating this notion of a cash grab, I would encourage him to reach out to our municipal leaders, as I did, to get their point of view. We represent them. I know that they’re going to be watching how we vote on this, and I hope that we’re all going to vote in favour." ],

Mais ce qu’il fait, c’est qu’il traite de la capacité des municipalités de fixer des limites de vitesse sur leurs territoires et de l’utilisation de systèmes de contrôle automatisé de la vitesse et de systèmes photographique relié aux feux rouges.", "Ce qu’on fait, plus particulièrement : l’article 128 du code est modifié pour que les municipalités puissent désigner par règlement municipal des secteurs où elles peuvent imposer des limites de vitesse inférieures à 50 kilomètres à l’heure. Ici on parle, bien entendu, plus spécifiquement autour des écoles et des zones scolaires.", "On parle également de changer le Code de la route pour y ajouter une nouvelle partie qui autorise l’utilisation de systèmes de contrôle automatisé de la vitesse dans les zones de sécurité communautaire et les zones d’écoles. L’article 12 du code est également modifié afin de permettre au régistrateur d’exiger le retour de plaques d’immatriculation et d’annuler celles qui ne sont pas retournées dans le délai précisé. Les plaques d’immatriculation qui sont endommagées, modifiées ou usées, ou qui se sont détériorées au point où elles ne peuvent pas être photographiées par un système de péage électronique, un système de contrôle automatisé de la vitesse ou un système photographique relié aux feux rouges, si besoin est—il y aura un délai de 30 jours pour faire ça, pour avoir d’autres plaques d’immatriculation.", "Dans un dernier temps, le Code de la route est modifié afin de supprimer la restriction prévue au paragraphe 205 voulant que les systèmes photographiques reliés aux feux rouges puissent être utilisés uniquement dans les régions de la province désignées par les règlements. D’autres dispositions sont modifiées en vue de préciser que des renseignements peuvent être indiqués par surimpression sur le recto ou le verso d’une photographie utilisée comme preuve et en vue de transférer au ministre le pouvoir du lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil de prendre des règlements en vertu—bon, tout ça pour dire que ce ne sont pas des gros, gros changements au Code de la route qu’on est en train de faire là.", "Dans un premier temps, what the bill does is, it amends the Highway Traffic Act to allow municipalities to set default speed limits throughout a designated area in the municipality instead of being obliged to use the province’s default 50-kilometres-per-hour speed limit. We expect municipalities to use those in areas where there are children crossing to go to school, to make our schools and our children safer.", "The bill also completely rewrites the Highway Traffic Act photo radar legislation, enabling municipalities to use photo radar to enforce speed limits in schools or community safety zones that are designated under the bylaw of that specific municipality. This is where our colleague had quite a few reservations, because the bill allows the municipalities to do this but does not set any limits as to where, when and how such things could be done. Photo radar will only be allowed in these areas. It says that the province will no longer be able to use photo radar on highways, which it hasn’t done since it was shut down in 1995, but it does open the door for municipalities to do the exact same thing that the province will not be allowed to do.", "Existing photo radar enforcement in trial procedures that are described in part of the bill are repealed. The province may make a regulation prescribing new procedures. These regulations supersede the Provincial Offences Act in case of a conflict. This happens quite a bit with bills lately—where it gives the government power to do something yet to be defined in regulation, if and when they see fit. The problem is that, as legislators, we get to see the bill; we do not get to see the regulations that follow which can sometimes stray far away from the intention of the bill into areas where, had it been included in the bill, we would have voted against.", "The registrar may require the return of plates that have become so damaged or worn that they cannot be photographed by a tolling system, red light camera system or photo radar.", "Let me tell you that I don’t know who did the last batch of plates in Nickel Belt. Frankly, I haven’t done anything different with my car than I have done for the last 40 years or so that I have been a driver, and for some reason, I am through my third set of plates. I keep my cars for a very long time, Speaker, and it used to be that I would buy a car, keep it for 10 years and 10 years later I would buy a new set of plates. Because you have a new car, a new set of plates looks good. But the old ones were just fine; some of them are still in my garage as souvenirs.", "But now, it’s like every winter, by the time spring comes around—and it’s happening on my car again—the paint seems to chip off. First, it’s the white paint that goes off, then it’s the blue. Then all I have is this perfect piece of metal at the back of my car that nobody could read, even if you had your nose on it, never mind a camera, a police officer or anything of the sort. It has nothing to do with me, Speaker. I drive on the same roads that I used to, the same way that I used to. I don’t wash my car any more than I used to, which means never. Yet the licence plates seem to erase themselves by themselves. There’s a little bit of work to be done here so that we don’t end up buying a whole bunch of plates." ],

  "text" : [ "My esteemed colleague there is talking about a cash grab. It sure looks like we went on a procurement process that allowed us to maybe buy those plates a little bit cheaper, but we did not get the quality we wanted with the new supplier, because the plates that are being shipped to Nickel Belt right now are no good. They need to be replaced way too often for my liking. A whole bunch of us end up driving around with plates that nobody can read, and every now and again, we get pulled over for such plates and then have to go get new ones. I am talking from experience.", "Another part of the bill: The province will no longer need to make a regulation designating an area where red light camera evidence may be used. This is to see who, basically, speeds through a red light.", "With the province’s default speed limit, it can be very cumbersome to lower overall speed limits in a municipality since it requires costly new signage everywhere. Many municipalities have sought the authority to set a lower default speed limit in designated areas or in their entire municipality. I can tell you that I represent Nickel Belt. I represent 33 little communities. None of them is big enough to be called a city, a town, or even a village. I guess some of them—Gogama could be called a village. But most of them are very small.", "Most have one thing in common: They have either a major highway or regional road going straight through the centre of them. For many of them, that means that this highway or this regional road separates kids from their schools. I will give you a specific example in my riding, in Dowling. Dowling is divided right down the middle, sort of, by Highway 144. Remember Highway 144? That’s the highway that goes from Sudbury all the way to Timmins. If you go north of Dowling, there is no shoulder to that highway. There’s a whole bunch of moose. There is nothing, not a gas station, not anywhere to stop for 200-and-some kilometres, except for the Watershed, when it’s open. But just before this, you have the beautiful little community of Dowling.", "On one side of Dowling, the side where the river goes through, is where most people live. A lot of people live on the side of the river. It’s a beautiful little community. Then comes the big highway, Highway 144. Highway 144 at this point will not only have the usual traffic coming down from Timmins, but it will also have the traffic from three big mines. If some of you have never seen a slurry truck or an ore truck, they are big, they are massive and they’re paid by the load, which means they go really fast. All of these trucks, usually one every two minutes, drive down Highway 144, fully loaded, to go to the smelter and come back as fast as they can to get a reload. They go straight down Highway 144, which divides the community of Dowling. The school in Dowling, the library, the pool, the Tim Hortons—all of the businesses are on one side of Highway 144, and all of the kids, their families—the residents—are on the other side of Highway 144. I’d like to read you a letter that I have got from one of my constituents regarding that. Basically, it’s one of my constituents who is worried. I’s from Chantelle Gorham, and it reads as follows:", "“Hi France! Our daughter attends Larchwood P.S. in Dowling—and since we are from Levack, we drive her to and from school each day. We have spent the last three years bearing witness to near misses and students dodging cars on foot and bikes to cross Highway 144. At 3:05 when school ends, there is a steady stream of traffic from the various shift changes”—because shift changes happen at about 4 o’clock, so if you want to catch the cage at 4 o’clock, you will be driving down by Dowling to make it to Levack, Onaping and the three mines that are down there. “I have inquired about a crossing guard and was told that since each child can be bused, they are walking/biking to school at their own risk. I am at the point that the risk is simply too great. I have made a request of the school to have the first bus leaving for the day stop and allow the bike/pedestrian traffic to cross—but this seems to be falling on deaf ears. Considering the school, community centre, ball fields, Tim Hortons etc. are located on the opposite side of the highway to most homes—it would seem alogical choice to have a crossover put in (marked crossway with the overhead lights). This would not only help the students in the afternoon, but also the morning. It would also help the community member with a safe and noticeable place to cross, and is located at about the halfway mark”—so there’s a grocery store and a pharmacy on one side, and everybody would cross over there to go to the arena, to the pool, to the school, to the Tim Hortons, to everything else that’s on the other side of the highway. “Traffic is 60 kilometres an hour in that zone—however from my years of policing, I would easily clock drivers going at 90 kilometres-plus. To have a six-year-old gauge how fast traffic is coming (because it is never clear both ways) is almost impossible—and is sure to lead to tragedy. Can this be done before the beginning of the next school year?", "“I have attached a video of the daily antics I see. Not only is the school not enforcing helmets—there is nobody there to supervise”—because you can see in the video a whole bunch of kids on their bicycles with no bicycle helmets. “They recently sent a letter home to parents explaining that they allow their children to walk or bike to school at their own risk—but I find that risk too great to leave it to a signature of approval on paper.”", "I am telling you this story, Speaker, because it has to do with speed limits, but it also has to do with every community being a bit different. In that particular community, I have gone to see the Minister of Transportation, who agreed to do a review. At the end of last fall, I was quite happy to see that he had seen it our way: that there should be a safe crossover in Dowling to allow the kids who don’t want to take the bus. It seems pretty silly to sit sometimes for a half an hour on the bus, when you can walk across the highway and be at your school in less than five minutes. If you’re on your bike, it will take you two minutes to go across, but if you take the bus, you will go zigzag, zigzag, zoom-zoom, back and forth, and it will take you 30 to 40 minutes to get to your school.", "When it’s really cold, most of the kids take the bus. But I hope spring will finally come to Nickel Belt. We had a beautiful weekend, but we still have lots of ice and snow. But I can tell you that in the spring, the kids want to walk to school. It’s good for them to go for a walk. It’s good for them to ride their bikes with their helmets, and I would like to see a crossing on this road, as well as giving the possibility to slow the traffic down. This is one example.", "We had another example in Capreol, where Podolsky Mine brings basically all of their ore trucks straight down the main road in Capreol, which means that they go right where the kids walk to go to school—most of the kids in Capreol walk to school. I went and saw what was Falconbridge at the time—it became Sudbury Integrated Nickel Operations, Glencore—and basically made a deal with them that they would stop their trucks going through when school opens and when school ends, so that the kids could safely go. You can see how having flexibility to protect the kids can make a big difference.", "We have this bill here that would allow a municipality to set speed limits to protect their residents. In my riding, there are a lot of municipalities—there’s no municipality; there’s Sudbury and a whole bunch of little towns, villages and communities—that would elect to have lower speed limits than what is presently there, to try to protect the kids. But don’t forget, to the Minister of Transportation, that a crossover is the safest way, because then everybody crosses there, there’s a flashing light, and it’s safe for the kids to go to school. But it’s also safe for anybody who wants to go to the Tim Hortons, the arena, the ballpark or anything else that happens to be on one side of the highway while everybody else lives on the other side of the highway. I hope that we can find a resolution to that.", "Comme j’avais commencé ma présentation en français et aujourd’hui c’est la Journée internationale de la Francophonie, je vais finir en disant qu’il y a des parties du projet de loi 65, Loi modifiant le Code de la route relativement aux limites de vitesse dans les municipalités et à d’autres questions, qui pourraient être utilisées pour protéger nos enfants et protéger les résidents dans les zones où le danger est plus haut.", "Malheureusement, le projet de loi ne parle que de possibilité. Donc, dans le projet de loi lui-même, il ne fait qu’ouvrir la porte à la possibilité de changements. Les changements eux-mêmes seront dans des règlements que nous, comme députés, n’en verront pas. C’est toujours un peu problématique pour un député d’ouvrir une porte quand on ne sait pas exactement où elle va emmener.", "Donc, c’est sûr, comme mes collègues partout : La sécurité de nos enfants dans des écoles—il n’y a pas une personne qui va s’astiner avec ça. C’est comment est-ce qu’on le fait pour s’en assurer?" ],

To the point made by my colleagues from the Conservative Party and their concerns about what really is the government’s intent, those are conversations we have to have. I look forward to hearing the government always clearly explain their full intention with things.", "Another point that my colleague made when talking about road safety: licence plates. I do hope that we have that conversation. I still have old licence plates that were from my parents’ cars. They’re souvenirs. You put them up in the garage. But you can’t really do that anymore because they aren’t made with paint—I am sure someone will correct me. They’re adhesives now. They are stickers. When it peels off the plate from general wear and tear and what happens on our roadways, those licence plates are degraded so quickly. It’s like they’re designed to peel off, and I’m sure that somebody will correct me on that, too. I would love to hear that defended, because now we see, over and over, these peel-off licence plates, which is another example of—well, it just doesn’t seem right, and I’d love somebody to address that.", "Anyway, I’ve run out of time.

I think others who have watched television and read the news in recent years have been very impressed negatively by the number of people who have been killed, for instance, on the streets of Toronto alone. I’m alarmed when I see that number. Perhaps it’s because there’s more coverage of it and so on, but it is very serious when I see once a week almost, you turn on a Toronto television station and someone has been killed. This doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen in rural areas; it does. I know we’ve had some fatalities in rural areas as well.", "School zones are of particular interest because kids in school are often not thinking, first and foremost, of traffic safety, and drivers who should be watching extra carefully going through school zones sometimes do not. In the community where they might say people have a variety of views on how much speed contributes to accidents and on their own experiences, I think where they do agree, where there’s a consensus, is that in a school zone you have to ensure that drivers are proceeding at a speed that is going to be safe for the children.", "Now I see in my own community, for instance, a number of flashing signs at the time the schools are emptying or the kids are going into school. As a result, we’re seeing fewer of those accidents happening in school zones. I certainly understand why school boards and municipalities would want legislation of this kind, and I support it." ],

I gave the example of the small school in Dowling that needs a safe crossover to cross Highway 144 that happens to divide their little community. There are a couple of other communities in Nickel Belt that would benefit from having a speed limit lower than 50 to make things safe. You have to realize that, in Nickel Belt, those are main roads that cross our little communities. When you think main roads in Nickel Belt, you think double-tandem trucks full of ore, double-tandem trucks full of slurry that go straight through our community. They come at 50—really more like 70, and sometimes faster than that. It’s pretty hard for a six-year-old to be able to gauge all of this, make its way around and do that safely. We have had unfortunate accidents that have happened, just like everywhere else. This bill opens up the door maybe to make some of the communities in Nickel Belt safer, so it is worth looking at.", "When it comes to photo radar, the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington is right that they don’t use this language any more. Photo radar is like selling Hydro One. The Liberals didn’t sell Hydro One; they broadened the ownership. The Liberals don’t have photo radar; they have automated speed enforcement.

I know that in opposition—because I was in opposition for more years than in government—you always try to make something out of a bill that it isn’t. The official opposition has characterized it as a bill associated with money. I think the people in the municipalities would disagree with that. The school boards, the Ontario Safety League—all advocates for safety—would say this is all about safety in school zones. The measures that are described in this bill are going to have, I think, a significant effect on enhancing safety even further in school zones.", "It’s particularly true, you notice, at the first of the year, when the police are out in great numbers, when school starts, because they know the kids have been out of school all summer long. They’re going back to school, and their minds are not always, number one, on safety and watching for vehicles.

Mr. Speaker, this legislation is all about reducing fatalities, reducing serious injuries, and the paramount issue in this legislation is road safety. As we know, Ontario’s roads are among the safest in North America, but we know that we can always make more improvement.", "Speed is one of the biggest dangers on Ontario’s roads. In 2013, approximately three out of every four speed-related collisions occurred on municipal roads. Municipalities have been asking us for some time to provide them with stronger tools so that they can keep their local roads safer. That is why our government has brought forward this legislation, which, if passed, would provide municipalities with access to new measures to improve safety on their roads. This is providing them with stronger tools to protect vulnerable road users, including children and seniors. Local governments are very supportive of it.", "The mayor of Mississauga, Bonnie Crombie, said, “I welcome news that the Wynne government will empower municipalities to install safety cameras near schools to reduce dangerous speeding and protect families.”", "This is all about providing municipalities the tools they need to protect our children. We all know that there is not one size that fits all, so it’s very important to give municipalities the tools that they need, that they have asked for—and they have been asking for some time—to find solutions that work for their unique needs.", "It’s also very important to remember that municipalities are mature levels of government and are accountable to the citizens who elected them for the decisions they make. So we look forward to continuing to work with municipalities to find new ways to keep all of our local roads safer.", "This automated speed enforcement technology ensures that it is used where it is needed the most, especially in high-risk areas and in areas where the municipality deems there is a clear need.", "The official opposition is saying that it’s a cash grab, that it’s not about reducing fatalities, that it’s not about reducing serious injuries. But a study was conducted in 2010, and this review of 35 studies found that in those areas where automated speed enforcement technology was implemented, fatalities and serious injuries were reduced by up to 44%. It is a telling sign that in leading jurisdictions in road safety, including the UK, France, Sweden, and the Netherlands, those jurisdictions have used this technology to supplement strong legislation and traditional enforcement strategies.", "This is all about providing municipalities with more road safety tools so that they have the tools which they have specifically asked for. I support this legislation. I hope all parties support this legislation, as we did with Bill 31, Making Ontario’s Roads Safer." ],

This is about saving lives. We know—there’s really good evidence: a 44% reduction. That almost cuts in half fatalities and serious injuries. Why wouldn’t we want to do that? There is absolutely no good reason for anyone to vote against this. The only objection I’ve heard is that it’s a cash grab. Well, if anyone is grabbing any cash, it’s the municipalities, as my friend from Ancaster-Dundas-Flamborough-Hamilton—whatever the riding is—says.", "The municipalities will put this money to good use, but that’s a real side point. The point is, this legislation saves lives. I can’t imagine that anyone in this House would not want to be on the side of saving the lives of children, saving the lives of seniors and saving the lives of others.", "So I fully support this legislation. It’s just absolutely the right thing to do. It’s also what municipalities have asked for. They have asked for this legislation. I think, on this side of the House at least, if there is a request and it is a legitimate request and it is a reasonable request, we treat municipalities with respect. This also indicates respect for those municipalities. If we saved one life, I think it would be worth doing; this is going to save a lot more than that.", "I did note with interest that the member from Pembroke said this, just in February, a few weeks ago: “If this is something that the communities are supportive of—and I believe they are—it’s something that I would personally be very much in favour of. We want to make sure that this doesn’t become a political football that gets kicked around.” Well, I think we all should be listening a little bit more to the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, because I think he got it right. This is one of those items. We all should be unanimous on this. We should just get it passed. We should just move on, Speaker.", "I heard the member from Kitchener–Conestoga talk about Highbury Avenue in London being potentially impacted by this. Well, I tell you: I drive on Highbury Avenue a lot. Are there speeders on Highbury Avenue? Yes, there are. Are there schools on Highbury Avenue? Yes, Speaker, students use that street. The member from Windsor–Tecumseh suggested I might have been one of those speeders. It is possible, Speaker, that I maybe have occasionally speeded from time to time. But if I knew that there was a big fine attached to that, I might even slow down.", "I think all of us care about the people of our community. We all care about the kids in our community and we all care about the children as they’re going to school and coming home from school. Why would we not follow the lead of other jurisdictions that have made road safety a priority? We heard from the member from Mississauga–Brampton South about the countries that have done this already. France, Sweden, the UK and the Netherlands are all using photo radar. They’re all using photo radar to help slow down traffic and help save lives.", "Interjections." ],

I do want to talk about some of the other elements of this bill, because it is photo radar but it is so much more than that too. It’s about reduced default-speed limits so that municipalities can have a lower speed limit than the standard, as long as they post it when you’re entering and when you’re leaving the municipality. That makes perfect sense to me and should not be contentious one little bit. Red light cameras, also: It would allow municipalities to use photo technology, again, to lay charges against motorists who run red lights in those municipal intersections. These are all initiatives.", "We’re proud of our record in Ontario. We have very, very good road safety in this province, but it can be better. We can save lives. I think everyone should just stand up and say yes. Put the politics aside. Don’t use the political football that Mr. Yakabuski warned us about.

I think we are here to debate not just our own opinions but to bring forward the opinions of our constituents, the residents of the communities we all represent.", "There are several concerns. One is, with red light cameras, who’s driving the vehicle? People have concerns about that because they sometimes, at work, lend a car to a colleague, or to a neighbour at home, or a relative, and they want to feel that they’re not going to get dinged a month or two later because of that.", "In terms of photo radar, people want to feel that what we’re doing is in the best interests of the entire community, that it’s not a cash grab. Whether that money goes to municipalities or doesn’t go to municipalities, they don’t want to feel that they are driving perhaps a kilometre or two or 10 above the speed limit—that’s very low—they’ve just experienced horrendous congestion trying to get home and now they’re trying to make up exactly 30 seconds. We have to be cognizant here, Mr. Speaker, that people have lives. They have to pick up their children and get to programming. They are not just speeding because they have no regard for the safety of others.", "Oftentimes people are speeding because of the horrendous congestion on our roads. We should be doing more to synchronize the traffic lights so that people aren’t speeding up to try to make a light. They’ve got signs posted the way they do in many towns in Europe that tell people what speed they should go from one light when it turns green to make it to the next light, so it just turns green as soon as they get there. Then they won’t be speeding up to try to make a green light.", "I think we see a lot of support for making our roads safer.

On the same hand, municipalities, as she said, are a senior, mature order of government.

I’m not certain where this misinformation originated, but you need to know that it is not true. It is not going in on Ontario highways. Automated speed enforcement, as stated in Bill 65, is going to a tool for municipalities in community safe zones. We do trust our municipal partners in order to respect them. They know who elected them. They know how to enforce this, and we’re giving them a tool that they can use. I know that in my region of Waterloo, our municipal leaders and our chief of police have added their voices to the chorus of municipal leaders right across Ontario who say that they need and want this tool to slow down speeders.", "We’ve heard from a number of opposition members this afternoon touching on this concept of a cash crab. Let me speak to this. What you need to know, again, for the benefit of people who are watching at home, is that there is no financial benefit to the province of Ontario with this. If municipalities choose to have these cameras, they have to pay for them and they have to maintain them. They’re going to be the ones issuing the tickets and they will get the proceeds, not the province. So if the opposition members decide that they’re not going to be supporting Bill 65, they’re going against what their municipal leaders have told us they are looking for. We know this is going to keep our streets safe, and we’re happy to respect our municipal partners to that end." ],

Is it the owner of the vehicle? It’s very difficult—I’m going to use the term “photo radar”—to identify who is driving the car. If somebody lends out their car—if you lend out your car, Speaker—and it happens to get caught in these zones, the owner of the vehicle will have to pay the fine. So we have to understand that.", "It’s also interesting: I heard that these zones wouldn’t be going on highways. Well, out in rural Ontario, there are schools located on provincial highways. So are we not putting safety zones out in the country? The government seems to think they’re just going to go in towns. So I do find that strange.", "I’ve seen police cars parked around schools where bus unloading occurs and where these zones are. A cruiser will stop people from speeding; it certainly slows them down.

Mr. Speaker, we all support increasing safety around our schools and for our students. We all want our children and grandchildren to be safe going to and from school and playing in our communities. As the weather gets warmer, more children will be walking to school and playing outside. Safety, particularly for children, is a goal we can all agree upon.", "Unfortunately, I’m not sure if everything this government has done is consistent with that goal. For example, I do wonder how forcing students to take longer bus rides to attend schools in another community, because the local school has been closed, increases student safety. I think we could do more for student safety if we figured out ways to have children attend schools in their own communities rather than closing local rural schools and having students travel an hour each way to get to and from their school.", "I’m quite sure the parents of students in Honey Harbour’s Our Lady of Mercy do not feel that their children will be safer attending a school in Victoria Harbour than they are in their own community. And if the public school in Honey Harbour, which is also in the midst of an accommodation review, closes, those students will have to travel an additional 60 kilometres, to Glen Orchard Public School, north of Bala. I can’t imagine parents will believe that this will make their children safer. If this government was truly interested in student safety, they would have supported our motion for a moratorium on rural school closures until they could find a way to help communities keep local schools open.", "If this government was truly interested in safety, both for students and for all Ontarians, they would not have allowed winter road maintenance in this province to deteriorate to the point where the Standing Committee on Public Accounts felt the need to request the Auditor General to do a special report on the issue. And let’s be clear that it’s not common practice that the public accounts committee requests a special report. The state of our winter road maintenance was so bad, and so many MPPs heard from their constituents, that the opposition asked for this special report, and the committee agreed to it.", "As everyone in this House knows, the Auditor General determined that this government, by changing the way road maintenance contracts were awarded, saved money “at the expense of a reduction in the timeliness of ensuring Ontario highways are safe for motorists in the winter.” Obviously, safety was not the government’s first priority when it changed the way road maintenance contracts were awarded.", "Not to focus only on the negative, I’m pleased that this government has done some things for student and public safety, including cycling safety, which certainly impacts some students. Allowing students who cycle to school to ride safely on paved shoulders definitely improves safety for those students and all cyclists. Unfortunately, if those students attend a local school that is up for an accommodation review, like Gravenhurst High School, they may not be able to cycle to school if their own school closes and they have to travel to another town.", "Mr. Speaker, as you know, I’ve had several private member’s bills on paved shoulders, and I’m pleased that it’s at least legal now in the province of Ontario to ride on paved shoulders. I certainly encourage that more provincial highways have shoulders paved when they’re being rebuilt.", "But back to this bill: There are things in this bill I think we can all agree upon. I support the change to allow municipalities to use red light cameras without having to come to the province and ask for a regulation to allow them to do that. I don’t have a problem with giving municipalities the right to set speed limits within their borders; however, I’m a little confused as to why this needs to be in the bill at all. Municipalities are already able to set speed limits on roads within their borders.", "The explanatory note reads, “Section 128 of the Act is amended so that municipalities can designate areas by by-law where they can impose speed limits that are lower than 50 kilometres per hour.” However, looking at section 128(2) of the Highway Traffic Act, it says, “The council of a municipality may, for motor vehicles driven on a highway or portion of a highway under its jurisdiction, by by-law prescribe a rate of speed different from the rate set out in subsection (1) that is not greater than 100 kilometres per hour and may prescribe different rates of speed for different times of day.” It seems like it’s already there, so why are we giving municipalities a right they already have? It makes me think that this has nothing to do with allowing them to set speed limits, but rather that the whole purpose of this bill is to give municipalities the ability to designate community safety zones where they can use photo radar.", "That brings us to the real issues of this bill. Unfortunately, the title of this bill, the Safer School Zones Act, does not give a clear indication of its contents. Even the longer title, “An Act to amend the Highway Traffic Act in respect of speed limits in municipalities and other matters,” leaves out what this bill is really about: photo radar.", "In introducing the bill, the minister used the more technical jargon—automated speed enforcement systems—twice in his short statement. Why not say it like it is and use the more widely understood term, photo radar? Even in her press conference before the bill was introduced, the Premier did her best to avoid using the words “photo radar.” She described it as, “A speed-activated camera to take pictures of the license plates of unsafe drivers who are speeding.” She went on to describe the fact that a ticket will be mailed to the owner of the vehicle.", "The bill even strikes out the words “photo radar” in the Highway Traffic Act and replaces them with “an automated speed enforcement system.” Speaker, let’s be clear: What we are talking about today is photo radar. It seems like the government was hoping that no one would catch on, but that is what this bill is all about.", "I know my colleague from Kitchener–Conestoga has clearly laid out the history of photo radar in Ontario, so I won’t get into that except to say that it is a contentious issue that I did hear some grumbling about in my riding of Parry Sound–Muskoka when this was announced.", "I do have some questions about this legislation that weren’t answered in the minister’s leadoff speech, and that I would like to get on the record now. I hope some of these things will be addressed in committee and that the government will consider amendments to further clarify this bill.", "Currently, the speed limit in school zones is tied to the times of day when children are coming and going from school. Will municipalities be encouraged to use photo radar only during those times, or at other times when children are likely to be coming and going? If not, exactly how does using photo radar outside of a school or community centre at 4 o’clock in the morning help increase student safety?", "Will the province measure the effectiveness of using photo radar in school and community safety zones? In posing this question, I want to give credit where credit is due. Sean Conway, long-time Liberal MPP for Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, repeatedly asked the Bob Rae government what criteria they would use to measure the effectiveness of that government’s experiment with photo radar: “Will the Minister of Transportation today announce to this House or indicate to this House what specifically are the safety criteria by means of which the photo-radar pilot project will be assessed at the end of its tenure?”", "That was Mr. Conway in this House in December 1994, and that was just one of many questions he asked about measuring the effectiveness of photo radar. It seems only fair to ask that this government commit to an assessment of whether or not photo radar in these community safety zones actually does anything to promote safety, just as their predecessors asked of the Bob Rae government.", "I do want to say that at least when the NDP introduced photo radar, they did it as a pilot project, with a requirement for an assessment of the safety benefits. I would like to see more of this government’s legislation introduced with a mandatory review to measure whether or not the legislation is achieving its stated purpose.", "Finally, has the government defined what can be declared a community safety zone? I realize this term is already used in the Highway Traffic Act. However, given that this designation will allow a community to implement photo radar—something even the Liberals described as a cash grab the last time it was implemented in Ontario—I think we should have assurance that the current definition will continue. I ask this because I’m concerned that otherwise a municipal council could try to declare the whole of their town a community safety zone, or they could implement photo radar anywhere in the town. Or, as one Hamilton-area councillor suggested, could a town designate a major thoroughfare as a community safety zone, just so that they could use photo radar on that roadway? I think all are very valid questions.", "There must be a safety-related reason for declaring an area a community safety zone, to ensure that municipalities don’t simply create these zones so they can implement photo radar as a revenue-generating tool. I understand that municipalities are feeling pinched, but I don’t believe that the province should be promoting photo radar as a way for them to raise money. I do have to wonder if this is being proposed now in order to try to placate municipalities that are complaining that they don’t have enough revenue-generating tools. If so, it is giving municipalities a bit of a double-edged sword: “Here’s a way to generate revenue, but use it at your own risk.”", "I wanted to just briefly talk about how other jurisdictions have dealt with safety in school zones, which is something, as I’ve stated, that I think we all want to see. That’s one of the places where we absolutely want to see safe driving practices.", "I’ve gone to Florida the odd time, and in Florida, when you hit a school zone, everyone drives exactly at the speed limit. They don’t go two miles an hour over the speed limit, because it’s a well-known fact that the police are there on a regular basis, and if you do speed in a school zone, there is no mercy: You are charged.", "So what I’m saying is, if you were simply wanting to go with safety, you just need to be much stricter with and actually have enforcement, and have police cars there in school zones to do their job.", "In my riding of Parry Sound–Muskoka, I have the Humphrey school. I was actually involved, meeting with MTO and with the school board and concerned parents. The provincial highway runs through the small community of Humphrey. In that community, the municipality lobbied to lower the speed limit, and they also got a flashing light up there, so that when it was flashing, drivers would be aware that there were students in the area and would slow down. That is something that is also, I think, an effective way of increasing safety in school zones.", "But the biggest thing is enforcement, if you really wanted to make it safer. It absolutely works in Florida. No one speeds through a school zone in Florida, because they know they’ll have a big ticket if they do so. And they don’t have photo radar there.", "Back in the early 1990s, the Liberals called photo radar a cash grab, and that’s exactly what it is. Premier McGuinty was asked to allow municipalities to use photo radar, and he said no.", "In 2015, the Minister of Transportation—the same Minister of Transportation who has introduced this bill—told the Toronto Sun that “the province doesn’t have an interest in returning to photo radar.” Maybe that’s why, in all their speaking comments, with the exception of the Deputy Premier, they’re using all these other long descriptions.", "I’m not sure what has changed since then, except maybe that municipalities are desperate for revenue sources.", "In the early 1990s, the Ontario government was desperate for revenue and, as a result, the Bob Rae government brought in photo radar. It’s not just me saying that. On November 17, 1993, the member for St. Catharines said the following about photo radar: “I looked at photo radar and said we wouldn’t have photo radar coming in in this province if it weren’t for the fact that the Treasurer needs money and wants money. That’s the main reason it came in.” That was the member from St. Catharines in 1993. He just spoke a few minutes ago, and he didn’t seem to be saying the same thing at all.", "The similarity is that this government is in a similar situation as the NDP government was in 1995: a terrible financial situation. The current financial situation with this government—of course, we know they’ve doubled the debt of the province to over $300 billion. The interest on that debt is now $1 billion a month. We are in a similar sort of dire financial situation. That’s where, I guess, this looking for revenue sources makes sense.", "I think Mr. Bradley was right. I can’t help but think that this government is giving municipalities the ability to implement photo radar because they are desperate for funding now.", "Beyond the fact that it is a cash grab, I have another concern about the possible return of photo radar. This is an issue which I’ve raised in the past as a private member’s bill co-sponsored by the member for Burlington: the legalization of bike racks on cars, which might obstruct the camera’s view of the licence plate. I reintroduced that bill today, and it’s now called An Act to amend the Highway Traffic Act to end flak for carrying racks. We want our citizens to be active and to cycle. We want tourists to come to our province to cycle on our beautiful trails. Cycling, both recreationally and competitively, brings a lot of people into Ontario and into my riding of Parry Sound–Muskoka, and yet, in Ontario it is still illegal to have a bike rack that might obscure the view of your licence plate. It is a law that is rarely enforced, but once in a while it is, and it needs to be fixed. Mr. Speaker, if we have more photo radar across communities all over the province, this situation will get much worse and we’ll have people getting charged.", "The reason I initially put this private member’s bill in was because of a constituent of mine who was driving on the 407. They were charged with having a bicycle rack on the back of their vehicle that was obscuring the licence plate. Despite the fact that this particular constituent actually had a transponder—so they weren’t trying to avoid the fee for going on the 407—they were still charged. That meant that that constituent had to come down to Toronto to note that they were going to contest the charge, and they had to come back to Toronto once more to fight the charge. They got off because they took pictures of OPP vehicles that had similar bike racks on the back and showed them on their day in court, and managed to get off. But with much more photo radar around, and with municipalities relying on it as a revenue tool, I can see this becoming a much bigger problem—all the more reason to either not have more photo radar or to make sure that this exemption that my private member’s bill would put in place gets put in place.", "The town of Huntsville hosts an Ironman triathlon which attracts competitors from across Ontario, Canada, North America and even some from other continents. In order to support events like this, we need to update our legislation to allow people to legally carry their bicycles on bike racks mounted on the backs of their vehicles.", "I’m concerned that the reintroduction of photo radar will create an extra obstacle to updating our legislation to make Ontario more cyclist-friendly. I hope that all members of this House will support the private member’s bill I reintroduced. As I said, it’s called “no flak for carrying racks.”", "In the minute that I have left, I thought I’d just talk about some other safety concerns with driving. I think the member from St. Catharines talked about how many people are regularly being hit in the city of Toronto now—pedestrians. That is certainly a huge issue. My own feeling is that we need to look at cities like London, England and the way they manage peoples’ vehicles and cycling, because I think they do a far better job in terms of efficiency of moving people and, I suspect, have a much better safety record than we do in the cities, particularly in the Toronto area. It seems like, every week, a pedestrian is being hit in the province of Ontario.", "I also think that one of the big problems in recent years that has come up is texting, whether you’re walking and texting or driving and texting. I know that there are more and more efforts being made to make people realize that it’s like the new drinking and driving. You just shouldn’t be texting when you are driving a vehicle.", "Mr. Speaker, I can see I am out of time, so I will wrap it up there. Thank you for the time to speak this afternoon." ],

Sometimes when you have a piece of legislation come to the floor of the Legislature it amazes me how differently we see the laws that are outlined in that legislation. Obviously the resistance that is coming from the PC caucus on this stems from photo radar; they have a long-standing opposition to having any kind of automated speed control in communities.", "Surprisingly, though, in this particular piece of legislation there is a strong case for having measures in place that ensure that children are safe in and around schools. Our reading of the legislation indicates that the automated speed enforcement, ASE—otherwise known as photo radar—can be authorized in a community safety zone designated by municipal bylaw or a school zone designated under the act. School zones must be within 150 metres of a school, but a community safety zone need only be in an area where public safety is of special concern.", "The PC caucus, the Liberal caucus members and, obviously, New Democrats feel strongly that municipalities are well positioned to determine where those community safety zones are and that there may have to be the ability to adapt, as the member has indicated, when some of these rural and northern schools are in and around provincial highways.", "There’s room to make this a stronger piece of legislation, but at the end of the day having measures in place that keep children safe should trump all of the other issues." ],

He was unsure who would receive a ticket violation: Would it be the driver or is it the owner of a vehicle? The answer is that it’s the owner of a vehicle.", "It’s very similar to the way that we currently handle red light cameras. Currently, if you run a red light—many municipalities across Ontario are using red light cameras; we have many of them in my own region of Waterloo region—a ticket is sent to the address of the vehicle owner, and that is tracked through the vehicle registration. I hope that that provides clarity for him.", "I would say to you that I can speak personally about this. My husband received a very hefty ticket in the mail not long ago for a red light violation, and he wasn’t even in town that day. We were able to determine it was one of our kids who was responsible, but my husband got stuck with the ticket.", "There is one last comment I’d like to make about slowing down traffic with automated speed enforcement. I had a conversation with Mayor Margaret Lupton recently. She is the mayor of Zorra township. Here is an exact quote from her: “Daiene, we are frustrated beyond belief with speeders.” We met at ROMA, the Rural Ontario Municipal Association. They’re looking for options, ways of slowing down speeders. She said they put in speed bumps in town but they weren’t working. In fact, one man came up to her in a coffee shop and laughed at her and said, “I can still take those speed bumps at 110 kilometres per hour. They’re not slowing me down.” Clearly, speed bumps are not working.", "Margaret and other municipal leaders across Ontario are looking for options and Bill 65 would answer that." ],

I happen to have a daughter who has been living there the past five years, so I spend a little time visiting her. They have a lot more traffic and people and activity than we do in Toronto, but it seems to be managed much more efficiently and, I suspect, more safely as well.", "One of the key differences is that whereas in Toronto the intersections are always plugged, generally with people walking across them and vehicles waiting to turn, in London, England, the pedestrian crossovers tend to be not at the intersection, but slightly up from it. You normally cross one lane and onto an island, and then cross the rest of the way. For the pedestrians, they very clearly mark, especially for those of us who are not used to vehicles driving on the other side of the road—as you go to step on the street, it states very clearly “look right” or “look left.” So the difference is that their intersections have bicycles, buses and vehicles moving through them all the time. Ours tend to be completely clogged with vehicles getting frustrated trying to make their right-hand turn through pedestrians, which I think is a dangerous situation, and also one that is not very efficient in terms of moving people or vehicles.", "I think we could learn a lot from London, which seems to do a so much better job than, certainly, what I’ve seen in the city of Toronto.

I do think, though, that we have some shared goals. There has been a common acknowledgment on the Legislature floor today that safety in and around schools is an ongoing issue. We have enough research and we have enough evidence to confirm that.", "For me, this issue actually goes quite a bit back in history. One of the first committees that I sat on at the city of Waterloo was a traffic-calming committee in the municipality of Waterloo, in Uptown. As communities grow, they deal with these certain pressures, these growth pressures, and some communities do a very good job of adapting to it and accommodating it. This was around 2002, and this is when speed bumps became speed humps. I remember this very clearly because all the language got changed, and these were thought to be less intrusive but equally effective as a traffic-calming measure.", "One of the first city council meetings that I ever went to, again in 2002, was to ensure that a stop sign was maintained in and around a school. We’ve come a long way from that, which is good. Certainly, the police forces—a special shout-out to the Waterloo region police force for my riding of Kitchener–Waterloo, and indeed, the entire region. They have done an amazing job of transferring knowledge not just to kids and students, but most importantly, to the adults and to the parents who are in these communities.", "The region of Waterloo has an excellent program called Active and Safe Routes to School, which once again relies on evidence and research which demonstrates that when children walk to school, their academic outcomes are markedly better, because they have this really good experience of having fresh air and being active and getting to school. That has been a huge culture shift, it needs to be said.", "I sat on the Waterloo Region District School Board for nine, almost 10 years, and there wasn’t a meeting that would go by where community safety and the speed of cars around schools didn’t come up. When the school board pushed back and tried to educate the parents of those communities, we were very surprised to find that there was, quite honestly, a culture of entitlement around those who were driving to school. One instance in particular was at the Mary Johnston Public School. We would have parents parking two or three deep, blocking traffic, to drop kids off. These students, literally, were under a kilometre away from the school. We had to do a lot of work to work with the community to build some safety measures—the walking school bus where kids walk together.", "There was a time and a place where we didn’t actually have to teach children how to walk together to school, and perhaps as communities change—and I’m not discounting that there have been some serious safety issues across the entire province, and some of those safety issues are very hard to predict, but when fear is the predominant emotion—and parents, of course, love their children deeply; they feel directly responsible for getting their child to that school and they feel that the best way to do that is to drive.", "It’s a huge amount of work to get them to the place where they can walk with a volunteer. The Waterloo Region District School Board is working with the Canadian Cancer Society to train volunteers to walk with students to schools. That’s where we are. To hear one of the other members talk about how congestion has become a factor in the speed of cars around schools is quite something. There seemed to be an undertone of making an excuse for those drivers. There is no excuse for cars to be going through school zones at upwards of 70 kilometres an hour.", "I want to give special thanks to the Waterloo Region Record, which did a very good job of tracking the incidents in Waterloo region. I’m going to give this data because we have to have some context to this conversation about why safety is so important around schools. When the Waterloo Record mapped the number of traffic incidents from 2006 to 2014 that involved school-aged children, they showed that September was the peak month, not surprisingly—it’s an adjustment—for crashes involving school-aged children. It takes everyone to come together to ensure that that transition time is monitored very carefully. When kids are returning to school after summer vacation, they are at a higher risk. In fact, over the nine-year period, there were 61 collisions in the first three weeks of school. These are collisions between a car and a child, or sometimes an adult—a couple of them were adults—most of which happened between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. and between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., when children are either going to or leaving their schools.", "The municipality, the city of Waterloo, in co-operation with the school board—because those two levels of government have to work collaboratively—began a pilot project in 2013 to try to make some of these school zones safer by unifying and reducing speed limits in school zones to 40 kilometres an hour. Since that pilot project, the city of Waterloo has completed its installations of 40-kilometre-an-hour zones at all elementary schools. The lower speeds are a positive step toward improving safety and encouraging drivers to be more aware of children and parents exiting vehicles and crossing the street, particularly during busy mornings and afternoons.", "It has already been mentioned that the police are major partners in this, especially during the transition into the month of September. At the start of the school year, Waterloo Regional Police were at 29 elementary and high schools in the region. In February, however, Waterloo Regional Police charged a man for driving over 100 kilometres an hour at 9 a.m. on Friday outside of a high school in Kitchener.", "Not only do we need police to continue to enforce school and community safety zones, but we need to change driver behaviour as well. I have to say, call it what you will, this automated speed enforcement system that’s contained within the legislation, or photo radar, is a deterrent to having drivers use excessive speed around schools. It is, and the research confirms it.", "Also, we have enough research from various coroners’ inquests, and even as early as 2012, the Toronto Medical Officer of Health, David McKeown, presented a report on the public health impacts of active transportation. His report recommended lower speed limits as a way to improve safety for pedestrians, and proposed that the default speed limit in residential areas be lowered to 30 kilometres an hour, which the World Health Organization says is the speed at which a pedestrian’s chances of surviving a collision with a car are at a maximum. That’s what we’re talking about here: reducing the speed so you can ensure survivability of the conflict between a car and a pedestrian.", "When I was on the school board, though, there was this huge tension between those who have cars and those who don’t, those who have busing and those who don’t, those who feel safe enough to let their children walk to school and those who don’t. It does take the entire community to ensure that children get to school safely.", "With this piece of legislation, though, I have to say that when I first read it, I was like, “What am I going to talk about for 20 minutes on this?”, because this is just common sense. I’m genuinely surprised that there is resistance to enabling municipalities, empowering municipalities, to follow through on one of their core responsibilities, which is ensuring that our communities are safe.", "I just want to review what this does.", "Bill 65 will amend the Highway Traffic Act to allow municipalities to set default speed limits through a designated area in the municipality, instead of being obliged to use the province’s default 50-kilometre-an-hour speed limit.", "It completely rewrites the Highway Traffic Act’s photo radar legislation, enabling municipalities to use photo radar to enforce speed limits in school or community safety zones that are designated under the bylaw. Photo radar will only be allowed in these areas. That needs to be very clear, given this fearmongering that it’s going to open the door to excessive photo radar everywhere, when it clearly states that it will be in community safety zones, which will be set by the municipality.", "Now, if there is a loophole piece in this legislation, it is our job to find it, and it will be our job, as legislators, to be sure, when it’s at committee, to close that loophole, unless we’re going to open the wound and have a fulsome debate on photo radar in the province of Ontario, given the fact that the Liberals and the Conservatives, in the early 1990s, both vehemently opposed this. That’s the only way that this should actually happen, right? You can’t just slide it in there under the door.", "But at the same time, you can’t blame people for having trust issues. The language in legislation matters, and there have obviously been incidents where legislation with a great title was brought to the floor of this Legislature and sounded great. We all thought the new standards around government advertising were going to prevent the government from using partisan advertising, and that is not the case, as we now know. Essentially, the Auditor General has said that there are advertisements out there right now where she would challenge this government in their use of them.", "Call it what you will—automated speed enforcement system, photo radar—obviously this will be a tool that municipalities can use in school zones or as designated by the municipality. The province is enabling that to happen. Municipalities have asked for it and, yes, municipalities need revenue.", "The fact is that the revenues from Highway Traffic Act offences currently flow to the courts under the Provincial Offences Act. In contrast, though, revenues from the administrative penalty system remain with the municipalities. That is clear. And so municipalities would gain access to new revenues if they are allowed to use administrative penalties for photo radar speed enforcement. This may be the purpose of Bill 65’s broad regulatory authority to establish this new enforcement regime.", "With the province’s default speed limit, it can be very cumbersome to lower overall speed limits in a municipality, since it requires costly new signage. Many municipalities have sought the authority to set lower default speed limits in designated areas or the entire municipality, so in this regard, the government is responding to a long-standing ask of municipalities, and perhaps it may open the door for some of the other municipal asks that have been on the table for a long time.", "My colleague mentioned joint and several, which would be a great asset and comes up every year at AMO in the bear pit. It’s getting a little painful to have it come up every single year because there really is nowhere to go on this issue. Certainly, legislation and change is needed on joint and several.", "While some critics will say—and some opposition members have said—that this is a cash grab, if the cash is going to the municipality, it is not a provincial cash grab. It’s not. It pains me, in some respects, but it’s clear. So this argument on this side of the House on this particular issue really doesn’t make any common sense—any Common Sense Revolution, any common sense at all. I think that you will hear from municipalities on this because they are desperate for this government to listen to them, and on this issue they are. So I’ll leave that up to you.", "Some stakeholders like Toronto, Ottawa and York region and other municipalities have sought the authority to deploy photo radar, and they welcome the bill. York region has also specifically requested the authority to use administrative penalties rather than the POA, the Provincial Offences Act, to enforce photo radar. I guess it needs to be said that CAA, who we all value in this House, has actually surveyed their members: 70% of their members support the use of red light cameras, for instance. They have yet to comment specifically on some of the issues in this bill, but we will be looking to them.", "Having been on the school board for so long dealing with these issues on a very personal level, like going out in front of the school and watching the chaos around schools, and then working with the municipality to create some measures, both physical measures, like the speed humps and stop signs—but municipalities have also been challenged to ensure that crossing guards are funded in certain jurisdictions. In Waterloo, parent councils and school councils were very active in trying to ensure that there was a physical person at a crossing zone. The thinking was that that human being, that crossing guard, would be there for a fixed amount of time while the community adjusted to certain points of access or of tension. But we have to remember that new kids come in every year. So my feeling, very strongly, is that having a crossing guard physically be there to help our youngest children cross very busy roads is still in their best interest. We have seen—and, myself, I’ve witnessed—cars blowing right through those crossing guards’ crossing areas. It’s hard to enforce that.", "So this is the other side of the coin: Enforcement is needed to ensure that, whatever measures come from Bill 65, there is a corresponding amount of resources to ensure that these measures are enforced. With any new change, there will be resistance; there always is. Sometimes that will be very difficult to overcome. But, hopefully, giving municipalities discretion over changing speed limits in their community will lead to safer roads in the province of Ontario. We believe that this is the right direction to go in.", "I’ve already mentioned that evidence shows that pedestrians are much more likely to survive traffic accidents if drivers maintain speeds of less than 40 kilometres an hour. I did mention Toronto health and safety. But the Chief Coroner for Ontario conducted a comprehensive review of pedestrian injuries from traffic incidents and found there was a direct correlation between vehicle speed and the severity of injuries suffered. You may be interested to know that 67% of the deaths in Ontario in 2012 occurred on roads with posted speeds above 50 kilometres an hour, while only 5% of deaths occurred on roads below 50 kilometres an hour. So that stat, in and of itself, gives us enough, I hope, motivation to ensure all-party support for any measure that reduces the speed in and around schools.", "I’ve mentioned some of the issues that the whole community of Kitchener-Waterloo has tried to address around the Canadian Cancer Society’s healthy and safe walk to school.", "But there is a point that I do agree with from some of the comments from the PC members, and that is that we are losing schools: our smaller schools and our community schools in rural and northern parts. I mentioned in my statement today Rideau High School in Ottawa. Because there hasn’t been a comprehensive review of the funding model, because there hasn’t been a true resourcing to value community hubs—there’s lots of talk about community hubs—but the fact that 227 schools have closed in the province of Ontario since 2011 will result in students having to travel farther distances, be it on a bus, be it through a neighbourhood or be it through a community. Those school closures will lead to more students being transferred to school by vehicles, and that is most unfortunate.", "Once those schools are closed, we don’t get them back. It’s almost impossible to bring back a community school, even if you try a leasing strategy and try to buy some time.", "By my comments, I hope that you will know that while we are looking for greater clarity on some of the pieces of legislation, we will be supporting Bill 65 and making it stronger at committee." ],

They approached me about putting in a speed bump. I somehow convinced my colleagues on city council to put it in, which was fine, until the lady at whose front door the speed bump was going to be, in their driveway, said, “I like the idea, but not in my front driveway.” So you can’t please everybody all the time, Speaker, no matter what you do, be it photo radar, be it the speed in school zones.", "I was amazed to hear the member from Kitchener–Waterloo say that the regional police there just busted somebody for going 100 kilometres in a 30 zone, in a school safety zone.

They would be able to create zones with reduced speed limits to decrease the severity of pedestrian and vehicle collisions in urban areas and participate more easily in Ontario’s red light camera program without the need for lengthy regulatory approval.", "Speaker, this is really about giving municipalities what they are asking for—tools that they can use to be able to protect our most vulnerable citizens: children and seniors. This act speaks directly to me. I’m a parent of six children. I often say that I’ve had kids in school for decades; my youngest is in grade 8. I’ve seen the issues over the years with, sadly, some of my children’s friends having been struck by cars, cars that were either speeding or not paying attention in school zones. I’ve seen people pass by school buses without stopping when their red lights are on. These are issues we are all upset about.", "I also bring a different perspective, Speaker. When I started my nursing career many decades ago, I was at the Hospital for Sick Children for 10 years. I worked in the emergency department and the intensive care unit.

I had heard they were talking more about the digitization of dangerous driving in the province of Ontario. That way, there may be other technologies. What you get in this automated speed enforcement is that they’re not specifically going to be relying necessarily on kinds of photo radar. There may be new technologies developed, advanced sonar or laser—who knows?

Some have noted that it will be left up to municipalities to determine what they are. That’s really important, because I think we might even find opportunity in serious construction sites, particularly as you see in the city of Toronto right now across the top of the city through Eglinton, where there’s significant construction going on. Maybe there are opportunities, because that becomes a significant community safety zone that I think we need to take a close look at. They’re in the business of protecting workers who are working in and around a construction site, particularly in transportation—and maybe that scenario, that a municipality could determine what would be a community of interest to be a safety zone, and they could bring in cameras to that effect or bring in automated speed enforcement.", "In my community, particularly as a result of one of these very tragic situations, where a young girl was struck in Leaside by a speeding car and died crossing the street, we have a proliferation of signs that are popping up all over the neighbourhood to slow down—community safety zones.

So in addition to listening to municipal mayors all across the province, councillors and school boards, I think we’re also showing here, in this new direction, that we’re listening to the people of Ontario. It’s unnecessary that people should have to be putting these little signs across our front lawns in order to remind people.

In 2013, three out of every four speed-related collisions occurred on municipal roads. We want to do something about that. We’ve heard the concerns from citizens on this issue. We have crafted this bill, the safer schools act. We’ve particularly heard concerns around speeding around the school zones.", "Just some facts, because there has been a lot of colourful debate—Bill 65 has three elements. Here are what the three elements are.", "First, the automated speed enforcement; that’s also known as photo radar. With respect to that, a municipality would be able to implement it: image capture and speed reading technologies. They would be activated by a speed reading exceeding a predetermined amount in a school zone. Those would be called community safety zones. They would be signed sections of the roadway where safety is a special concern. Traffic fines would be doubled in those zones in order to promote safety, and importantly, those zones would be designated by the municipalities by bylaw. So we’re giving the responsibility to the municipalities to know their own municipalities better than anyone else. All of the councillors in each of the 400-and-something municipalities in Ontario know where those types of signs should be.", "The second element is reduced default speed limits. There would be some changes to signage requirements. The urban speed limit is now 50 kilometres an hour. Currently, municipalities may, through bylaws, implement posted speedings other than the default. What this legislation does is it will allow municipalities to establish reduced default speed limits in urban areas and within municipal boundaries. Again, the signs would be posted, but the important thing here is that the decision to do that would rest with the relevant municipal council. The Ministry of Transportation would work with our road safety partners to designate the regulations and so on.", "The third element is the red light camera program. It will be easier to enter into that program. The red light camera program allows municipalities to use photo technology to lay charges against motorists who run red lights at municipal intersections. There are terrible, horrific accidents of cars going through red lights—death, injury etc. I need not remind members of the tragic consequences of that.", "While the red light camera program is a municipal initiative, the province will provide the legislative and regulatory framework for the program. We’ll do that through the Highway Traffic Act. Right now, municipalities can enter the red light camera program only after they receive provincial approval. This would allow the municipalities to enrol in the red light camera program on an opt-in basis. There would be a streamlined approval process.", "Again, the essential point here on those three elements of Bill 65 is that it will be the responsibility of the municipalities and those councillors in the municipalities who know their municipality intimately, who know where the dangers rest, who know what their constituents want, and know best how to implement this program. This way, with the best possible decisions about where to implement these driving regulations having rested with the municipal councillors—again, I say, in their own municipalities—we’ll get the best results to make the safest municipalities in Ontario." ],

The temptation by municipalities to put photo radar in community safety zones, which could be all the roads, is definitely there.", "There’s also the idea of expanding the potential use of photo radar at stoplights.

The principal of École catholique St-Michel has started a committee, along with the parent council, to try and get that changed, so it at least goes to 60. We realize it’s the Trans-Canada Highway, but this is an entrance to a school, and this school—a big addition is being put on it as we speak. There’s going to be a daycare attached to it. The only way to get to this school is that entrance on Highway 11. There have been several close calls at that entrance, and now that the school is being made even bigger, we don’t want to any longer take that risk.", "I’m specifically making a request to the Minister of Transportation that we look at this, that we look at if we can work together. We realize that we can’t have these cameras on provincial highways, but at the very least, could we look at lowering the speed limit in front of École catholique St-Michel down to a reasonable 60? We realize it’s a highway, but to have vehicles going at 90 kilometres an hour, where there are school buses turning in on a regular basis and where there will be people going to a daycare, is just not sustainable safety." ],

When you have a bill here where the party is even afraid to mention the technology being used, you’ve got to wonder about it.", "I can tell you from my days in municipal government that under this government here, we’ve seen huge cutbacks in funding. So yes, you’re forcing municipalities into considering new revenue tools, and it’s unfortunate that we have to resort back to photo radar, which didn’t go that well not that many years ago.", "We should be looking at more efficient government and really looking at how we can address some of the key issues, like health care. We shouldn’t be turning to more tax, whether it be cap-and-trade—every time we turn around, we hear about another tax from this government. I had a long conversation with a person from my riding in the last hour, talking about how when he goes to the hospital, there are no doctors, and the lack of health care. It all goes back to ample revenue and no solutions." ],

That is probably the number of words that come out of the mouth of the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. I’m sure you would agree, Speaker, that he can put more words into a two-minute or a minute-and-a-half response than anyone in this House. I’m a little concerned for his safety. Should he start tripping over those words, he could cause himself some harm.", "I would suggest that maybe, in the line of automated speed enforcement, we might consider something like a verbosity velocity meter, or maybe a cadence counter—some sort of way that we could measure the volume and the speed at which words are coming out of his mouth. At the same time, we want to make sure they’re good words, so I’m thinking maybe some kind of a mendacity meter or monitor of some sort in order to ensure it.", "But what I really want to do is focus on the remarks from our good friend the member from Carleton–Mississippi Mills. What was very clear in his comments to our speech is that the members of the official opposition have no trust that municipalities will exercise their powers responsibly. It was absolutely clear that they want to hold back any kind of power from municipalities to determine, for their own purposes, what are the right safety zones in their neighbourhoods. They will support the school zones, and I appreciate that, but they won’t support municipalities making a determination of whether community safety zones around—the comments of the community safety and correctional services minister talked about seniors in our community. There may be other zones that you have to protect with photo radar, as well, and I’m hoping they will come around. And if there are tweaks we can do in the bill, as was suggested by the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka around timing of when those safety zones are in effect, I think we should look at that." ],

  "text" : [ "I’ve been listening to today’s debate, and I find it interesting that most of the Liberal members, or many Liberal members, have prefaced their comments with the statement that Ontario roads are safe. Indeed, we are one of the safest jurisdictions in all of North America. The only province that is similar to Ontario in its road safety is PEI. No matter how you measure that, Ontario roads rank up as the safest, whether you rate that as fatalities or injuries per 100,000 of population, or per billions of miles or kilometres driven or by numbers of licensed drivers. In every category, Ontario roads are safe.", "When you compare that with places like Alberta that do use extensive photo radar, Alberta roads are far less safe than Ontario roads, and they rely heavily on photo radar. Just to give you a couple of statistics: per 100,000 of population, Ontario leads Canada with 3.5 fatalities per 100,000 of population. Alberta is near triple that at nine fatalities per 100,000, and that travels right through. We can see the same similarities whether we measure it by kilometres driven or numbers of licensed drivers.", "So I find it interesting that the members on the opposite side speak about the safety of Ontario roads, and then the member from Ottawa South spoke about the evidence of the safety of Ontario roads and then immediately defaulted and relied on tweets as a way to justify disregarding the evidence that we have in front of us. We heard a recollection of tweets that were completely in contradiction to the evidence of the statistics. Of course, this bill, Bill 65, ought to be named “photo radar makes a comeback in Ontario under a new name.” That’s the proper terminology of Bill 65.", "We’ve seen this often, Speaker. When the Liberals want to advance a bill that they know will not have public support or when they want to get out of trouble that their policies have got them into, they have an excellent cadre of wordsmiths who come out with phrases such as “automated speed enforcement devices” etc. It reminds me that they also get into these red herrings.", "Last week, when the member from Mississauga–Streetsville was speaking about the failed hydro policies in this province with the Ontario greenhouse growers, he blamed the cost and the challenges of the greenhouse growers on the level of humidity in Ontario, not the high cost of electricity. That’s pretty much a recurring theme or strategy with this Liberal government: When caught with their pants down or caught in difficult trouble, they come up with some very creative red herring to talk about. Last week it was humidity; too much humidity in Ontario is driving our greenhouse growers out.", "But focusing this back to the reality of this bill, not just what some Liberal members think it ought to be, but what it actually states: If this bill was restricted to placing photo radar in school zones, there would be support from all sides of the House on it. But that, of course, is not what this bill does. There is no constraint in this bill on where photo radar devices can be deployed. As I said in an earlier comment, Highway 7 through Carleton Place could have a photo radar on it, or Highway 7 in Perth, or Highway 41 in Napanee, or Cloyne or Northbrook. They could all have photo radar on them. And of course, Speaker, there are no schools on those roads that I just mentioned.", "But they are all able to have—this big, glaring loophole in this legislation, if it is a loophole, is designed as a way to hide—not hide; maybe disguise or camouflage—what is actually going on here.", "I would think, Speaker, if the government was truly interested in improving the safety around our schools, and I think that’s what we ought to be looking at—I’ll remind the members opposite about a recent experience of mine in Panama City Beach, Florida, this winter. We went down there for a visit, on a holiday, and I was intrigued to see that every morning when schools opened, and every afternoon when schools closed, the Panama City Beach Police Department placed a police cruiser on the road in front of the school. It had the lights flashing. I’ll tell you, a more effective means to control traffic and to reduce speed, I have never seen. That was a very, very effective way. And if small, little Panama City Beach can afford to place a police cruiser out in front of each of their schools, I think we should be striving for that level of safety in this province. That’s what I think.", "But we know a number of our municipalities are feeling burdened with policing costs under this government. We also know that a number of our municipalities are feeling a significant financial burden from the lack of transfers and grants to our municipal partners, and that they are having difficulty. One must conclude or look—is this a mechanism? Are the Liberals using the photo radar bill, Bill 65, as a mechanism to disguise their failure to properly fund our municipal partners? They are providing them a means to drive up their revenues with a false proposition that’s put forward in Bill 65. That is the real crux of this." ],

He mentioned about pedestrian fatalities and whatnot as well, an important thing for us to consider. Maybe I can send this over to the Minister of Transportation here today. It’s a Globe and Mail story entitled “Fatal Crossings.” They look in depth at the pedestrian fatalities here in the city of Toronto over the last number of years. I’ll just read this little part of it for the minister: “The Globe and Mail analyzed more than five years of Toronto Police Service data on pedestrian fatalities to determine where and how people die in the city. Trends quickly emerged: The victims are disproportionately over 65 and hit by a larger vehicle. They are usually walking across an arterial road ... typically at a spot without a traffic signal or crosswalk.”", "That’s where the great number of pedestrian fatalities occur. What are we seeing this government doing to improve there? Well, I can tell, we’ve seen very little. There’s no funding to our municipal partners to help improve on that end.", "Everything with this government comes down to revenue, and that’s what Bill 65 is all about. This is a bill that is about a cash grab and not about safety. It is a bill with a cash grab, and it’s not about enforcement. It’s a cash grab, but it’s not about reducing collisions. It’s all about failures to properly fund municipalities and giving them some crumbs in revenues through photo radar, to help mitigate those failures of this government.", "Speaker, again, if they were being factual and upfront and forthright with the people of Ontario, they would limit Bill 65, the return of photo radar, to school zones. But as I’ve heard this afternoon, there is no interest in that—no interest. Nobody on the Liberal benches has mentioned once any desire to restrain or constrain where photo radar would be deployed." ],

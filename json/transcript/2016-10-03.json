As you can tell, I’m very excited to speak to the bill and, therefore, moved one step earlier in the process for the debate.", "Speaker, it’s really my true honour to rise today to speak on the proposed All Families Are Equal Act, 2016. I will say with utmost sincerity that I am very proud of this bill. I believe in the principle that everyone in our province should be treated equally, no matter their race, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. Ontarians value diversity and they value equality, and supporting those core values are what this bill is all about.", "I also believe this bill responds to a key priority of our government, and that is to make everyday life easier for Ontarians and to remove unnecessary burdens and costs on our families.", "Ontarians know that family structures are as diverse and unique as the people who make up this great province of ours. There is no one way to start and raise a family. In the year 2016, this is something we, as a government, and as a society more broadly, have not only come to accept but embrace. Today we expect that members of the LGBTQ2+ community enjoy the same rights as their heterosexual neighbours: the right to love and marry the person of their choosing, and the right to start and raise a family.", "It may come as a surprise to many to learn that not every family is being treated the same under the current law in the province of Ontario when it comes to who is considered a legal parent. Right now, under the current law, some parents have to go to court to be declared as their child’s parent. Imagine having to spend extra time and money to be legally recognized as parents. For example, if a lesbian couple uses a sperm donor to help them conceive a child, under the current law today the birth mother and the sperm donor would be the child’s parents, even if that donor had no intention of raising the child. Meanwhile, the birth mother’s partner would have to go to the court to be declared a legal parent; in other words, they’re adopting their own child.", "As I have been working on this bill, Speaker, I often cite the following as an example when I try to explain to people what we’re trying to do: When my wife, Christine, and I had our second baby, Elliana, most recently—" ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you. Elliana was born on a Friday afternoon. By Sunday afternoon, I was sitting in the hospital, in Christine’s bed, and we had my iPad and we logged on to the ServiceOntario website, put in my name, put in Christine’s name, put in Elliana’s name, all that information, and, boom, we were registered. Our daughter was registered as our child. By Wednesday or Thursday, in the mail came her birth certificate and her social insurance number. I know at ServiceOntario, they guarantee you, very fast. All that stuff came in and we just had to pay a simple fee. That’s easy. That’s how parents do it.", "But that option is not available to two mothers having their daughter. They don’t have that option of just going online today and to be able to register both parents and register their child. No, in that instance, the other parent has to go to the court and adopt their own daughter to be recognized as a parent. That’s the inequality. That is the difference we are solving through this legislation—to ensure that all parents in Ontario and all children in Ontario are treated alike, are treated equally, and everybody has the same opportunity, if they can, to just sit on their home bed or their hospital bed with their iPad or whatever device they want to use, go online and register their child by paying a simple fee.", "Speaker, as I said, the proposed legislation would, if passed, ensure that both moms—that is, the birth parent and the birth parent’s partner—are legally recognized as their child’s parents from the moment the child is born, without a court declaration, without a court order and all the associated costs that come with it.", "This doesn’t just apply to the LGBTQ2+ community. With this bill, we’re working to create a future where all couples who conceive children using assisted reproduction do not have to go through unnecessary steps to be recognized as their child’s parents. The reality is that some couples just can’t have a baby on their own and must rely on donors to conceive, or find a surrogate to carry the child. Right now, couples who use a surrogate need a court order to be recognized as their child’s parents. Our proposed legislation would allow those couples to be legally recognized as parents sooner, provided that they have a written agreement with the surrogate before conception, the surrogate obtained independent legal advice before entering into the agreement, and she confirms her consent to give up her parental rights after the baby is born.", "Likewise, the updated law would also mean that other people who agreed to parent a child together won’t have to go to court to be recognized as parents of the child, provided there is an agreement before the baby is conceived.", "Our government believes that the best thing for a child is for there to be certainty about who their parents are at the earliest possible time. Of course, for parents, what all parents do when a baby is born or comes into our lives is to pay attention to the child, to provide all the important necessities of life to the child and to give them the love they need. Parents, when a baby comes into our lives, should be more focused on diapers and naptime, not on getting lawyers to get court declarations to be recognized as parents. That, I think, is a very important step.", "The other very important aspect in this bill, through the Vital Statistics Act, is that we’re ensuring that our forms reflect the reality of our families today. For that, it is extremely important that we use gender-neutral language in our forms. You will see, in Bill 28, references to using language such as “parents” as opposed to just “mother” and “father,” to ensure that all our forms are understanding of all families and all parents in our province.", "Our plan is to update these forms in the manual form they exist in, in the paper form they exist in, and, of course, to change these forms online, so that the ease of convenience is available to all parents in the province.", "I also just wanted to take a few moments to acknowledge the many people who have helped with the creation of this bill. First, I want to recognize Rachel Epstein, and Jennifer and Kirsti Mathers McHenry and their children, Cy and Ruby. They are with us today. Thank you very much for your incredible advocacy—and a big thanks to Kirsti and Jennifer for lending their children’s names to the bill that the member from Parkdale–High Park brought forward. My understanding is that it says “Cy and Ruby,” but Ruby is older than Cy. So it should have been “Ruby and Cy,” but somehow it happened to be “Cy and Ruby.” I’m sure Kirsti and Jennifer are working that out at home.", "They have been incredible partners during this entire journey by sharing their own personal story—which is difficult, at times, for anybody to do—with the entire province, but also compelling us, the legislators and the government, to take that important step as well.", "I noticed that Joanna Radbord is also in the House. Thank you, Joanna, for being here. Joanna’s son Cameron is a page, who I did not acknowledge last time—I don’t know if Cameron is in the House right now or if he’s in his math class; I think he’s probably in his math class if he’s not here. but thank you, Joanna, for your legal expertise in this very important issue as well.", "Clearly, this has been a team effort, and I do want to take a bit of time to recognize the member from Parkdale–High Park for introducing a private member’s bill on this matter. I have had the great honour and opportunity to work with the member from Parkdale–High Park now on a few occasions, on some very important bills. She has been—to me, personally—a leader in a lot of these important issues and an education for me. It has always been an honour to work with you, honourable member.", "Over the summer we worked closely with the member from Parkdale–High Park, and I believe that the legislation we have introduced achieves the same overall goals as her private member’s bill. I would like to thank the member for her advocacy on this important issue and for her leadership.", "In developing this bill, Speaker, my ministry also met with a number of other key stakeholders’ groups, including lawyers, fertility experts and members of the LGBTQ2+ community, to get their input on our proposed bill. We also drew on the work already undertaken by the Uniform Law Conference of Canada, including the Manitoba Law Reform Commission, and the experiences of BC and Alberta.", "I want to sincerely thank everyone who participated for their time and valuable contribution to the process. I also would like to thank the very hardworking members of my staff, and Susan Kushneryk, here in the chamber, for spending her entire summer working on this important bill, and staff from the Ministry of the Attorney General. There is an entire team of very dedicated people who worked extremely hard throughout the summer, meeting with our stakeholders, learning from them, discussing ideas, drafts being exchanged, to make sure that we have a bill that really ensures quality in our province.", "Speaker, the proposed All Families Are Equal Act will seek to end the legal uncertainty faced by parents who conceive their children using assisted reproduction. Our bill would update Ontario’s parentage laws so parents who have children with the assistance of a known donor won’t need to spend money on lawyers. They also won’t need to take time off work to go to court just so they can be legally recognized as their child’s parents.", "This is about ensuring that all kids conceived with or without assistance are treated equally by recognizing the legal status of their parents, whether they are LGBTQ2+ or straight. This is about ensuring that all families in Ontario are treated equally.", "Speaker, at this time our government will not be putting forth any more speakers towards the debate of this bill, so that it is passed as quickly as possible. We are really hopeful that we can move this bill sooner than later to the committee and to third reading, so that it can be passed into law and we can move forward with making important changes in our entire system in terms of all the forms to be updated, so that families can have the opportunity to access a system that accords equality.", "As we can all imagine, as we speak children are being born in this province of LGBT parents or straight. We want to make sure we have a regime in place that ensures equality for everyone. We do hope that the opposition parties would agree, as well, that this bill should be passed promptly. I have full confidence in all the honourable members, that they will take this matter seriously and will help in the prompt passage of this bill.", "Today, Speaker, I urge all members to stand together in support of equality by supporting this proposed Bill 128. Thank you very much for your time and, once again, thank you to all our great partners who are here in this room. Thank you for your advocacy and being here." ],

It was on before we left the House, and then, of course, with the prorogation, it has to be reintroduced.

I think we would all agree that we want all families in our province to have the same opportunities, that we want all children in our province to be treated equally. At the end of the day, the work we do in this Legislature, despite our differences, has only one end, and that is to ensure that there’s prosperity for future generations; that all children in our province, regardless of what background they come from—whether they live in big cities, small towns, north or south, indigenous communities—have the same opportunities.", "We know that inequality exists in our laws as it relates to recognition of children. We are, through this bill, rectifying that and we’re making sure that all families, in whatever form they come, have the same opportunities to succeed and thrive, and that those parents who have brought a beautiful new life into this world, into this province, are able to focus on doing what parents do: give love to their children. That’s the essence of this bill.", "We call all this debate—that’s the technical term—but I don’t think there’s any debate about this issue.

One of the elements that you see clearly in this bill is a reference to the best interests of the child. That’s made reference to many times in the bill. The second part that I want to explore during this discussion and debate is that we’ve often heard in the past from the government, from the Liberal Party, that they want to make laws and provide legislation based on scientific evidence and facts. I think those two elements need to be—I have some concerns overall.", "I don’t have a concern, of course, with equality. I don’t have any hesitation. There are parts of this bill that I think are very much needed, but there are some concerns that remain, some doubts that remain, on how this will all come into play.", "So just briefly, we know that under this bill, a child up until the age of one may have upwards of four parents recognized by this legislation. I see the member from High Park shaking her head. Not only is that what I read in the bill, but it is also in the technical briefing provided to myself from the Attorney General—up to four parents up until age one. But after age one, then, there are no prescribed limits in the legislation at the present.", "We know a lot of this bill has to do with advances in reproductive technology, which we also know will continue to advance. How far reproductive technologies will advance is anybody’s guess. We would be foolish to believe that further advances won’t happen. That’s an element that I didn’t hear from the Attorney General about this “up to four parents.”", "Here’s my question to the Attorney General: We know our Family Courts and our children’s court are significantly burdened with significant delays, wait times and costs. I don’t know if the Attorney General—well, I know I didn’t hear it, but I don’t know if the Attorney General has explored what will be the ramifications on our Family Courts with this bill. Will it exacerbate those already significant delays, costs and burdens? I’m not sure. But neither do I see any evidence provided by the government that they’ve explored this part of the bill.

I’m wondering how this new piece of legislation will impact the Family Responsibility Office. Heaven knows the difficulties and the problems that they have in tracking down a spouse who is delinquent in payments. How are they going to track down three spouses who are delinquent—or up to three or maybe more—afterwards? I didn’t hear anything from the Attorney General that they have explored these consequences. What are they doing? There’s nothing in the bill that provides greater abilities to the Family Responsibility Office to address this expanded—I guess that is the best word—scope of jurisdictions that they’ll have to deal with.", "I heard the Attorney General say that the Liberal government will not be putting up any more speakers on this bill. I think that’s the wrong way to go. I think this bill needs to be fleshed out so that we can fully comprehend what we’re asking our administrators, what we’re asking our courts to accomplish and also to be fair to the people in this province; to show the people in this province that these things, this piece of legislation, is very, very important and that we ought not to take it lightly or to dismiss it—that we don’t have to examine it and we don’t have to examine the consequences of this legislation, both positive and negative, because, as I said at the beginning, there are parts of this bill that I think are, indeed, positive. Maybe all of it is positive. But we just don’t have the information for us to come to that conclusion at the present time. Indeed, I would say that we don’t have nearly enough information to make that judgment or come to that conclusion.", "This bill often references the courts to make decisions that are in the best interests of the children. We’re asking the courts to examine all those details—whether it be with three parents or two parents or four parents or whatever—and make your decisions about custody, make your decisions about child support and make your decisions about parenting direction, based on the best interests of the child. Of course, nobody’s going to disagree with that. But I think it’s also important that we, in this House, do the same: that we examine this legislation on the basis of what is in the best interests of the children. To me, it’s not good enough for us to introduce a piece of legislation that says, “Somebody else will make decisions based on the best interests of the children,” if we do not uphold ourselves to the same level of responsibility.", "So I beg to differ with the Attorney General. I do hope that the government does put up some more speakers so that some of my concerns and some other concerns that may be raised during debate can be answered and can be fleshed out, again, not solely for our benefit here in this Legislature but also for the benefit of the people we represent, so that they have a better and full understanding of what this bill entails. We can’t expect the people we represent to have a full and complete understanding of this legislation if we fail to put any debate and examination into it ourselves.", "I also want to raise this with the government and with the Attorney General: Far too often, we see legislation advanced in this assembly where debate is either cut off short procedurally through time allocation motions or programming motions or what have you, and where committees are prevented from further comprehensive examination of the legislation.", "There’s one right at the moment—Bill 13—that passed second reading due to a time allocation motion last Thursday. It was referred directly to a committee. The people of Ontario had until 3 p.m. Friday afternoon to indicate they had an interest in speaking to that bill in committee. The committee began their deliberations and deputations at 8 a.m. Monday morning—today. Each deputant was provided five minutes to share with the committee their views on Bill 13.", "This is too important of a bill—I think Bill 13 was as well—to put that sort of process in front of people, to make people decide immediately, only within hours, to register with a committee and then only to be provided a five-minute presentation. We need to permit and allocate sufficient time for deliberations on Bill 28. Otherwise, we are not doing our job and we also won’t be providing the proper guidance to our courts if we pass a bill without thoughtful deliberations and explain how the government sees this coming into play.", "As I was contemplating this debate on Bill 28 and this idea of having four parents, I thought back to not only when I was a child but also as a parent. Speaker, I have to say there were times when there were disagreements by my two parents about how I and my eight brothers and sisters would be raised. Whether they be trivial or thought to be minor—whether you should be able to do homework or go out and play or whatever it may be—there were disagreements. And the same, of course, with my wife and I and our four children: We had disagreements.", "Having four parents is not going to diminish those disagreements. I would suggest to this House that it in all likelihood may give rise to further disagreements and discussions, or who knows what, on the raising and nurturing of children. I think that’s a fair comment. I think it’s appropriate for us to understand that. Then again, I just don’t believe these elements have been thought out in the best interests of the children. It may be appropriate politically. It may have value in an ideological sense. There may be a whole series of priorities that this government has that it thinks override or—let me put it this way—that the best interests of the children is not the focus of the bill; I don’t know. I didn’t hear anything from the Attorney General on this.", "How are we going to help remedy and help alleviate, help mitigate what appears to be a piece of legislation that may exacerbate or amplify or increase the probability of marital breakdown, or providing care and nurturing to one’s child and children? I’m not sure, but I just can’t believe that the government would introduce this bill without some recognition that this will, in all likelihood, cause greater difficulties in our family courts.", "Judge Brownstone has spoken at length—he’s a Family Court judge—and refers to it as “warring couples” in his Family Court and how Family Courts often don’t provide the remedy that some are looking for, in that the courts are more often referred to as a “warring” situation where vengeance is sought. I don’t know, when we increase the numbers of parents who might be involved in that situation, how it’s not going to be further complicated. Maybe I’m off the mark altogether, Speaker; I don’t know. But I think there’s merit in this assembly exploring these questions.", "I would also ask the Attorney General, going back to my initial statement about making legislation based on scientific fact and evidence: Is there a body of law, a body of information—I haven’t seen it, but maybe there is some body of knowledge out there, people who have examined this issue, who have done longer-term studies on these relationships and how they may or may not impact children.", "If the government has this information, if they have evidence that either refutes my concerns or alleviates or mitigates my concerns and the concerns of others, I think it would be appropriate that they table that with us, or, during debate, identify for us where we might find it, because I’ve looked for it. I didn’t have a lot of time. Remember that this bill was only introduced on Thursday last week, and this is our first opportunity to discuss the bill. Of course, the indications that we’re getting are that this will be our first and possibly only opportunity to discuss this bill.", "This bill could have some far-ranging and unforeseen consequences that we’ve yet to explore. When the bill does go to committee, one of our jobs at committee is to go through this clause-by-clause. Of course, we have limited time, and the bill will already be passed in principle at committee, so there will be no procedural options for us to introduce amendments to the bill that may serve to mitigate these concerns that I’m raising today.", "That’s not proper. Certainly, it’s not proper if we haven’t had the time to debate and examine the bill at second reading initially. So I do hope and encourage the government not to be expeditious on this bill, not to be so gung-ho to not debate it.", "I would implore the government that this bill does demand and justify a thorough airing in this assembly, and not just leave it to a five-minute deputation at second reading committee.", "I will ask that the Attorney General give some assurance as well to the House that people who can provide insight and knowledge regarding these fundamental changes be given adequate time at committee to advance them. Give adequate time for committee members to engage in a discussion with them and ensure, at the end of the day, that this bill, when passed, is indeed more likely to achieve the outcome that the Attorney General has spoken of and less likely to have unforeseen and unintended consequences that are only left up to an agency such as the Family Responsibility Office to try to alleviate or the Family Courts to try to find some clarity within the messiness that may arise.", "I think it would be unfair to both those institutions—our Family Courts and our Family Responsibility Office—to put them in that position. I think it would be unfair, of course, to parents and children if we create a legal framework that creates uncertainty and confusion and messiness because we are gung-ho to pass something in the name of equality.", "Equality is great; we all strive for it. However, it is not the only priority that we must consider. It’s not the only priority that must be deliberated. We want equality, but we also want a just system, we want to have fairness for all involved, and we want to do things that are indeed in the best interests of the children of this province—and not just put that onus on others, but take that onus ourselves and champion and advocate that we will not pass laws that are not in the best interests of children. I don’t believe there’s any way we can achieve that end without a full and thoughtful deliberation and discussion and debate at second reading, and I know that will also be required at committee.", "I was just saying that too often—here we are in the third week of the second session of the 41st Parliament, and we’ve already had a bill time-allocated and rammed through. You may be able to justify some time allocations—I don’t think so—but with a bill such as this, it can’t be justified to ram it through.", "Even though the minister has said that they’re going to stand down and not debate this bill, if there’s anybody on the opposite side who finds that my concerns have merit or have some element of justification, I would encourage you—I’m going to stay here and I’m going to see if the government can answer some of those questions for me. Let’s not stand down our obligations when we stand down our debate. Let’s stand up to and with our responsibilities and provide the people of this province the duty of care and the duty of responsibility that we all owe them, and ensure that what we do in this assembly will have the good outcomes that we all hope to achieve." ],

This is equality, of course, for parents, but it’s also equality for their children. I find it very difficult to understand how you could argue that there is anything that is more important than to have equality for our children and that it could be conceivably in the best interests of a child to be unequal to another child. That’s what you’ll get if you don’t pass this bill—with amendments, and I’ll talk about those a little later.", "Second of all, there was a concern about “mother” and “father.” You can call yourself “mother” and “father.” In fact, the passage of this bill will allow more people to call themselves mothers and fathers with the full weight of the law behind them.", "In talking about extended families, that there will be more marital discord with four people than there will be with two: Quite frankly, grandparents, aunts and uncles, others, everyone in a family has a stake in raising a child. In fact, it’s been famously said that it takes a village to raise a child. Again, the more adults who love a child, the better for the child. That’s definitely in the best interests of the child.", "The Family Responsibility Office—that the courts will be clogged. In fact, it’s to lighten the load on the courts that this bill is, in part, being tabled because it will allow parents not to have to use the courts just to adopt their own children. By the way, there’s a problem with adopting your own child, because until you do that, you don’t have the right to take that child to the doctor. Children could die as a result of parent inequality and child inequality. Think about that in terms of the best interests of the child.", "Also, just quickly, if there are more parents, there’s more possibility of getting child support, not less—more possibility of getting child support—" ],

He certainly did raise many questions in his speech. I heard him raising questions about the Family Responsibility Office, and certainly we’ve had many people in Parry Sound–Muskoka come to our constituency office, looking for help with problems they’ve run into with the Family Responsibility Office—in many cases a spouse looking to try to collect money that isn’t being paid. We’ve also had a lot of problems with birth certificates in my constituency office.", "I’d just note that the member did raise a number of questions and is looking for some responses from the government to those questions.

It didn’t come here easily, and it didn’t come here without a ton of work, but yet, as he said, did we get it exactly perfect? I would say that there’s room for improvement. The tone of the presentation made me a little bit nervous that there could be some reluctance to finally give the LGBTQ community the opportunity to be the parents of their own children and do away with this legal process where they have to adopt their own children, which is completely stupid and leads to a whole lot of problems or possibilities of problems—some of them have come true for some couples.", "Do we, on this side of the House, want same-sex couples to be recognized as parents for their children? Absolutely. Do I want this to happen, the sooner the better? Yes, absolutely. But at the same time, I realize that we have a job to do. When we read bills and we see that those bills need to be changed, need to be amended, then we have a process that allows us to do this, and hopefully would allow us to do this fairly quickly, so that we deal with this issue in due time.", "There has been, as I said, a long time before this piece of legislation was introduced by this government.

I want to talk about that a little bit because that’s where the objections to this bill really come from, what we call the “texts of terror.”", "I also want to talk about the bill itself and the amendments that I think are extremely important, that have to be made to really make this the bill that it should be; that is, the bill that will truly grant parents equality and children equality.", "First, very quickly, the texts of terror and the misreading, because I’ve heard these in the same-sex debate; I heard these when we introduced Toby’s law in 2012. Again, that was a joint venture, ultimately, between the Attorney General, myself and others, and I thank him for that. It took a long time, but we got there. That added gender identity and gender expression to the Ontario Human Rights Code. Also, banning conversion therapy—that was 2015, and it went a long way to stop psychiatrists and institutions from trying to turn queer kids straight.", "Behind all of this and all of the mail that we’ve received, we hear the same things. First of all, Genesis: “God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.” Guess what? God made Adam and Eve in God’s image, both; both male and female in God’s image. There you go. So don’t ever quote that to me again, because God is clearly both male and female.", "Second of all, Sodom and Gomorrah: It’s a story about hospitality. It’s not a story about sexuality. If it were a story about sexuality, the author would be saying, “It’s okay to rape a virgin daughter, but not okay to rape strangers in your town.” It’s clearly not that, unless you want to abide by that. It’s a story about how to treat strangers. It’s a story of hospitality. So don’t ever talk to me about Sodom and Gomorrah.", "Don’t talk to me about Leviticus. There are almost 700 scriptures in Leviticus. Some of them tell women at a certain time of the month to go live in a hut, to not eat shellfish and yes, anti-homosexuality, or whatever we think they meant by “homosexuality” back then. I don’t see people outside Red Lobster with signs, protesting.

Let’s talk about that.", "Let’s talk about the fact that Jesus never said anything about homosexuality. He did say something about divorce. He didn’t say anything about homosexuality, but did say, “Judge not,” and did say, “Love your neighbour as yourself.” He didn’t put qualifiers around it. There were no parentheses around that. So that’s the Bible. There, in five minutes—got it. Don’t talk to me about the Bible.", "Second of all, there’s a long history of folk who have been working for equality. That’s really what we’re talking about. I am both proud and humbled to have been part of that history. It makes me feel very old, but going back to 1971, the very first gay demonstration in Canada was on Parliament Hill in 1971. I was there and I want to read you what the demands were because these tie into what we’re discussing today. This was 45 years ago. First of all, there’s a letter, and I’ll read it later if I’ve got time.", "There were a lot of people that were involved in writing this letter and a lot of organizations: Gay Alliance Toward Equality from Vancouver; University of Guelph Homophile Association; Toronto Gay Action—I was part of that; University of Western Ontario Homophile Association; University of Toronto Homophile—it’s cute, “homophile,” don’t you think?—Association; Vancouver Gay Activist Alliance; Vancouver Gay Liberation Front; Gay Sisters; Waterloo Universities Gay Liberation Movement; and York University Homophile Association.", "It announces that, on “August 28, 1971, homosexual men and women and their supporters will rally in front of Parliament Hill in support of this brief.” It’s signed by—I don’t know what ever happened to him—my friend Brian Waite and myself in 1971.", "We did—actually, I didn’t make it there, but I signed on to the letter—and there were about 100 people who stood in the rain on Parliament Hill at the very first gay demonstration in Canadian history. Here are the 10 demands they made. This is 45 years ago.", "By the way, a little bit of history: In 1969, that’s when the first Trudeau, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, said of the government, “out of the bedrooms of the nation.” But he was talking about privacy. He was talking about what you do in your bedroom, which really did not affect the lives of LGBTQ2S people very much, because the police don’t usually kick in your bedroom door. It’s what happens when you leave your house: That’s where the law makes a difference—employment, housing etc.", "The demands were these—and this was two years after that:", "“(1) The removal of the nebulous terms ‘gross indecency’ and ‘indecent act’ from the Criminal Code”—they were in the Criminal Code—“and their replacement,” and it goes on.", "“(2) Removal of ‘gross indecency’ and ‘buggery’ as grounds for indictment as a dangerous sexual offender....” That was still in the Criminal Code.", "“(3) A uniform age of consent for all female and male homosexual and heterosexual acts.”", "“(4) The Immigration Act be amended so as to omit all references to homosexuals and ‘homosexualism.’” I didn’t know there was such a term. That was the Immigration Act. You could be kept out of the country back then.", "“(5) The right of equal employment and promotion at all government levels for homosexuals.” It wasn’t happening—certainly not.", "“(6) ...in divorce cases homosexuality, per se, should not preclude the equal right of child custody.” So, again, LGBTQ2S parents couldn’t file for custody of their own children back then.", "“(7) The right of homosexuals to serve in the Armed Forces....” We all know about that battle.", "“(8) To know if it is a policy of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to identify homosexuals within any area of government service and then question them....” There was really a witch hunt that was going on back then that continued on for a long time—and I’ll talk about that in the case of John Damien a little later.", "Here’s the critical one. Number 9 of our demands back then, 45 years ago, was, “All legal rights for homosexuals which currently exist for heterosexuals.” Here we are, 45 years later, and we’re still not quite there yet—certainly not until we get this bill passed in the province of Ontario and, arguably, in other provinces as well that don’t have parent equality.", "“(10)”—and this is really kind of full circle for me—“All public officials and law enforcement agents to employ the full force of their office to bring about changes in the negative attitudes and de facto expressions of discrimination and prejudice against homosexuals.”", "Wow! That was 45 years ago. No mention, of course, of “queer” or “trans” or “two-spirited,” but it’s amazing, isn’t it? We’ve come a long way—we have. But we’re not there yet. That shows, I suppose, how slowly the wheels of justice really turn.", "I mentioned that I was going to talk about John Damien. He was a man who sat as a judge with the Ontario Racing Commission, and he sued his employers, who fired him because they said that because they knew he was a homosexual, he was open to blackmail. That was in the 1980s and that shows you how difficult, even 10 years after the We Demand, it was to be an LGBTQ2S person even in the 1980s and 1990s—we remember the bathhouse raids in 1981—how difficult it was to just exist, to just go about your life as you would.", "Now we stand in a world where some 80 countries have laws against being LGBTQ2S and about 20 of them have the death penalty. I’m sorry to say that some of those countries have been incredibly influenced by those coming from this country and the United States, in terms of the way that they have written their laws. Again, without going back to the Biblical five-minute summary, a lot of those people call themselves Christian. They’re not, really, but they use that term.", "So here we stand looking at the latest piece of legislation that will actually go another bit of the distance to equality.", "I want to talk about my family first, because the political is personal; it always is. Certainly, political is personal for LGBTQ2S people and for feminists. I knew that when I married the second time, as a bisexual woman—my partner is male, but he had never had a child. My children are grown, and I didn’t want any more. He’s 17 years younger than me. He wanted the experience of fatherhood. Two of our best friends who live in Ottawa, two gay women, wanted to have children. So Gil became the donor for their two girls, born on exactly the same day—miracles of modern science—a few years apart from each other. One is now a proud teenager; she’s 13. The other is 10. They’re wonderful children: happy, healthy and part of our family. It’s great, because I don’t have grandchildren, so for me they’re like my grandchildren. For us, they’re an extended part of our family. But there were concerns. Back then, we and their mothers were concerned about how my in-laws would react to having these grandchildren. Gil is an only child, and he grew up in a Portuguese household—he’s the first generation. His parents are very Roman Catholic. Again, the only child, a son—in their house, when I met them for the first time, there were pictures of Jesus and Gil, and Jesus and Gil. We were concerned—with good reason—we thought, about what the grandparents’ reactions would be to discovering they had grandchildren. When Harriet, the eldest, got to be about one year old, one of the mothers said to us, “If we don’t tell them about their grandchildren, they will go through life never experiencing grandchildren.” So we steeled ourselves—also with legal help, because this was pre-parent equality, so the mothers had to legally adopt Harriet and Stella. They had to go through the courts. They had to make it all so. They had to draw up all sorts of forms before we all came out to the grandparents—my parents long since deceased. We all came out to the Portuguese grandparents. And do you know what, Mr. Speaker? An amazing thing—quite miraculous, I think—happened: They love their grandchildren. Who knew? Grandparents loving their grandchildren—wow, strange. They love their grandchildren, the only grandchildren they will ever have, biological grandchildren. We are one big, happy family. We are a very big, happy, Canadian family. There’s nothing more Canadian than our extended family, I’m proud to say.", "Really, that’s what this bill is about. This bill is about extending the rights of heterosexual couples to couples who are not heterosexual—and the rights of their children born to them to be the same as every other baby born to every other parent. That’s what the intention of this bill is. It’s hard to argue against it.", "A little bit of the etiology of this bill—because it hasn’t come along easily. It hasn’t arisen overnight, as some would have you believe. In fact, it’s been going on for a long time.", "Let’s look at the history. The Ontario Court of Appeal recognized equal marriage back in 2003, but of course LGBTQ2S parents didn’t have that recognition. Ontario courts have recognized that the Children’s Law Reform Act and the Vital Statistics Act discriminate against LGBTQ2S families and are unconstitutional, but it’s been 10 years since the courts told the government to fix the legislation. This isn’t overnight. It’s not even over the summer. It’s not without deliberation. It’s not without input. I warrant there are very few laws that we have passed in this place that have had as much input, deliberation, thought and action as this bill.", "In 2006 was the Rutherford case. This is when it happened. Justice Rivard found the Ontario birth registration scheme to be discriminatory, because it eliminated non-biological lesbian co-mothers.", "As I mentioned just briefly to the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington, this isn’t just about pieces of paper. It’s not just about recognition. It is about equality, and that is important, but not just about parent equality and equality for the children; it’s also about the safety of our children.", "Think about this scenario. You have two mothers—and by the way, the mothers of our children, as we call them, were in this scenario for a while, until they had to go through the courts and adopt the children legally. Jodi, my friend, was not the birth mother, so Jodi, being at home with the children while Caitlin was off at work, didn’t have the right to take them to the doctor and act as their legal guardian and parent. That can be catastrophic, as you can imagine.", "It’s about the safety of the children. It’s about the safety of the babies, that parents who are not the birth parents can look after the physical health issues of the child. They can actually keep the child alive, if necessary, with medical help. This is important. It’s not just about paper. It’s not just about parentage, and it’s not just about equality. It’s about the very well-being, the very life of these children.", "Again, in 2007, there was a ruling by the Court of Appeal for Ontario that declared there is a legislative gap in the scheme for parental recognition, and that may be in a child’s best interests to recognize more than two parents.", "On April 8, 2016—we have those who took part here—21 LGBTQ2S families issued a charter challenge against the Ontario government to fight the discriminatory laws. The court ruled in favour of the families and ordered the government to bring in legislation by September 30, 2016. They made it just under the mark, Mr. Speaker; just in the nick of time. But it’s a good thing, right? It’s a good thing that this happened.", "I’m going to go over some of the amendments that are absolutely essential if we’re going to get this right. I’ve already spoken to the Attorney General. He’s indicated a willingness to work with us on these and to make sure that the language gets it right because ultimately, if the bill doesn’t do what it’s designed to do, this is an incredible waste of time and would end up back in the courts again. None of us want that.", "Here’s what needs to change:", "Rules of legal parentage: In cases where a child is conceived through assisted reproduction, the law—sorry, this is not what I’m looking for; I’ll come back to this. Ah, here we go. Problems with the bill:", "(1) The bill elevates the importance of the biological father at the expense of the birth parent—who is overwhelmingly, of course, female—and children. The focus on biology in section 7 makes a rapist a parent. I know the Attorney General doesn’t want that. It’s not the intent, but it could be construed that way.", "It also makes it harder for a woman to give her child up for adoption, as a one-night stand, unknown father or rapist, even, would need to consent. We need to change the language there. Currently, this person—the rapist, one-night stand—who the mother doesn’t choose to acknowledge has to go to court and get a declaration. They don’t have automatic parental rights and therefore can’t hold up a woman’s decision to give her baby up for adoption.", "The bill, as drafted, diminishes women’s autonomy and increases the likelihood that babies will languish in foster care while “fathers” are tracked down and consent is obtained. We not only heard from the lawyers who were involved in drafting Cy and Ruby’s Act about this, but we’ve also heard from those who are involved in the adoption world about this. They’re concerned about it. It needs to be changed.", "(2) A parent who is not the birth parent but is the partner would still need to make a declaration under the current draft to get certainty. This is in section 8. It makes them a presumptive parent but puts no limits on what can rebut the presumption. The section needs to establish parentage except where a spouse doesn’t consent. Same-sex parents remain second-class. That defeats, really, the purport of the bill so, again, it’s something that needs changing.", "(3) The section on declarations, section 13, precludes a declaration where there has been an adoption. Often, same-sex couples who adopt internationally must do a single-parent adoption. Currently, those parents can get a declaration for the second parent. Under this bill, they can’t. That is a problem.", "(4) The bill imposes numerous limitations on declarations for multi-parent families. I actually raised this in the debrief. The courts have determined that it could be in that particular child’s best interests to have three parents. It makes the timing of the intention to parent together determinative when this may not reflect the reality of the child’s parenting or the child’s best interests. Instead, experienced family law judges should still have a measure of discretion so that the child’s best interests could govern. Again, changes in the wording.", "(5) New wills are required to capture children born using assisted reproduction if those wills were entered into before the act. The law should be applied to all instruments, whenever entered. Again, changes there.", "We’re hoping that after our discussion, the government will be amenable to those changes, and certainly they have indicated that they will be.", "I want to read the stories of some of the amazing women who are involved in making this day happen.", "First of all, Kirsti’s story—she is here with us. When Kirsti Mathers McHenry’s wife was in labour, the unthinkable happened—and her wife is here, too. There were complications and the doctors warned Kirsti that there was a chance that her wife could die. At that moment, holding her newborn baby, she watched doctors frantically try to save her wife’s life. This is from a press clipping. It also dawned on her that she might be raising the child as a single mom. If that nightmare was not horrifying enough, Kirsti also realized she would not be a legal parent to her own child.", "“As I held my wife’s hand and snuck glances at the two rolls of paper unspooling and recording the two heartbeats, I went through the possibilities. If my wife died, I might not be able to leave the hospital with our baby. Who would be able to? My in-laws. They were supportive. Maybe the hospital would let the baby leave with them. Our sperm donor—he was known to us—was another possibility. Maybe he could pretend to be more than a donor uncle for a morning and get us home.”", "In the end, Kirsti’s wife and new baby were both fine, but the experience was traumatic and highlighted a major gap in the current system.", "“My wife was okay and our daughter was okay, and we left the hospital together after visits from family. Months later, we obtained a court date and the three of us, with our lawyer, went to court to make me a legal mommy,” she said.", "This story has a happy ending, but the flaw in the system must be fixed. Parents should not be forced to adopt their own children.", "It’s a pretty dramatic example. Thank you, Kirsti and Jennifer. Applause should be given to them for being here." ],

  "text" : [ "Again, this has dramatic effect and should have dramatic effect if it’s done correctly.", "Here’s another story. Again, these are taken from press clippings. This is Raquel’s story. Raquel Grand and Deanna Djos are the mothers of two children, Thora and Aloe. Deanna is the genetic mother of Thora, who was conceived with the sperm of a known donor. Raquel is the genetic mother of Aloe, who was conceived with the sperm of the same known donor. Both births were difficult, with serious medical complications.", "Raquel writes: “A short while after Thora entered the world, it became obvious that Deanna was hemorrhaging badly and her body was not responding to the care the midwives were giving her. The midwives transferred Deanna’s care to the surgical team at St. Michael’s Hospital. I stood at the side of the room and held onto our new daughter and watched in horror as my wife passed in and out of consciousness, trying not to notice the alarming amount of blood that was accumulating on the floor around her bed in the form of soaked rags and the panicked scramble of midwives, nurses and doctors as they tried to gain control of this unpredictable medical situation.", "“I stood on the side of that room for six hours, holding the sturdy little body of our newborn baby who was full of life, as I hoped that my wife would not lose hers. More than once I realized that I might have to raise this little girl on my own. More than once, it dawned on me that I was not even Thora’s legal parent, as I had yet to adopt her. Would I be able to adopt my own child if my wife died? Would I lose custody of her because I was not her biological mother? These were questions I had to consider while holding out hope that Deanna would not leave us....", "“We still had to contend with the matter that Thora needed to be adopted by me and Mike had to sign his parental rights over. Despite making it through a very difficult birth, Deanna was still not well. She had lost a lot of blood and was very weak. Her iron levels were dangerously low. It was recommended she remain on bed rest, and not go anywhere that was unnecessary. However, due to the scare we had, we realized that Thora could lose both of her mothers if anything happened to Deanna. We felt it was very necessary to set up appointments with lawyers and get Thora’s adoption process sorted out even though Deanna should not have been out of bed. We spent more than a few days attending meetings and seeing lawyers for Deanna, Mike and myself. We spent thousands of dollars that should have gone into an education fund for Thora. In the end the three of us got what we wanted—I became Thora’s other legal parent and Mike was able to sign over his parental rights. Slowly Deanna regained her health, and finally, we were legally a family of three.”", "Again, severe psychological stress in the midst of severe physical stress—again, because the law failed to recognize their parentage.", "Finally, Donna’s story: I’m reading these stories because we’re not talking about something in the abstract. We’re talking about real people—real mothers, and fathers too, and real babies—and what the current status quo means if we don’t act, if we don’t pass this bill with amendments. Mr. Speaker, there is no excuse for doing nothing. By the way—again, working with the government—we’re hoping that babies born in the interim before this bill becomes law will also in some way be covered, because there are babies being born, and I’ve heard from their parents. Here is Donna’s story from a Globe and Mail piece:", "“Donna McDonagh’s daughter was born in the autumn of 2006—an exciting time in the province of Ontario for lesbian couples. A law was about to change, allowing two moms to put their names directly onto a child’s birth certificate. Their baby was the first in Ottawa to have a birth certificate listing two women as parents.", "“Both McDonagh and her partner, K., were in their 40s when they decided to start a family, but K. had embryos that she’d created some years earlier, using her own eggs and donor sperm. McDonagh was there when the embryo was transferred into her partner’s uterus, there for the doctors’ appointments, the prenatal classes and the birth. Because K. was self-employed, and McDonagh was a federal government employee, McDonagh took parental leave and was the primary caregiver for most of the first 11 months of their baby’s life.", "“McDonagh had every reason to be confident that she was a full parent before the law. Not only was her name on the birth certificate and their child’s last name a hyphenated hybrid of the two moms’ surnames, but the two women had signed an order of joint custody, declaring that their intention was to be co-parents with equal say in the child’s life. She was granted paid—and topped-up—parental leave. She’d successfully applied for the baby’s health card and social insurance number and was named as “parent” on the application for a passport. Wills, powers of attorneys ... everything signalled the same intent, that” she “and K. would play equal roles as parents....", "“‘I really felt that we were good,’ McDonagh recalls. McDonagh was aware that birth certificates were just the beginning, that there were other laws that were still awaiting revision, but she was confident that it would just be a matter of time before everything was updated as Justice Paul Rivard had said it should be in the 2006 landmark case that made the birth-certificate changes they had taken advantage of.” She says, “‘I trusted in that process.’", "“But in August 2009, the relationship ended. At the time of the breakup, K. agreed that there would be joint custody. But there was a loophole in one of the laws governing parentage, which could be used to cut McDonagh out.", "“The law was the Children’s Law Reform Act of 1990, and the loophole was that a non-birth, non-biological parent could only be ‘presumed’ to be a parent if the person both cohabited with the birth mother and was male. McDonagh isn’t male. This detail was one of the several bits of law that Justice Rivard had indicated was in need of updating, saying that lesbian mothers were correct to argue that they shouldn’t have to ask permission to be parents of their own children.", "“But those updates never happened. McDonagh’s name on the birth certificate, it turned out, meant very little....", "“The two women fought it out through the courts. In the end, after more than two years and hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal costs, McDonagh was” finally “granted joint custody of her daughter.”", "This, again, to the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington’s point: If you really want to clear up the courts and the fights in courts, this equal parenting bill is absolutely critical.", "I’ve gone over some of the problems. Some amendments are absolutely needed; there is no question. We’ve heard about those amendments from the stakeholders right across the spectrum, and I’m sure we will hear about them when the bill goes to committee.", "That’s something that I wanted to talk about too, because there is a process in this place. Not only has this bill been waiting 10 years to get here, not only did the courts rule 10 years ago that it should happen, not only was the government given a deadline of September 30 to make it happen, hence this bill—and now here we are with all of the court documents, with all of the research that’s gone into it—but we still have time. So to those who have concerns about amendments—the amendments that I’ve already pointed out or about, quite frankly, anything else—there is a chance at committee to testify. That’s what committee is for. By all means, put your name on the list and testify at committee.", "Then there’s time for clause-by-clause. That’s where the amendments come in. That is part of the process here. We will be putting forward amendments. The New Democratic Party has already listed what those amendments will be. I understand the government is in accord; hopefully they’ll put forward their own as well. The Progressive Conservative Party is welcome to put forward amendments at that time as well.", "But to argue that there hasn’t been enough time spent on this bill is a bit rich. We’re talking about over a decade, and we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal bills and court time being taken up fighting for what we’ve got in front of us, hopefully with amendments. Hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal bills and court hours taken up: To argue that this is going to create more court hours is a bit rich.", "Finally, we’re talking about the health and well-being of children who are being born almost as we speak. We need our children to be safe—all of our children. Children with families that look different from ours: We need them to be safe too. They cannot be safe if their parents are not equal; it’s that simple. They cannot be safe if their parents are not equal.", "To go over the case, again, that I made: The non-biological parent, without the thousands of dollars of legal costs and going through the courts and officially adopting their own child, would not have the right to take that child to a doctor if that child was in urgent need of medical care. That’s not safe and that’s not in the best interests of the child. I would argue that not being equal is not in the best interests of the child.", "I would argue further to that, because I’ve given you a kind of spectrum of 45 years of action on LGBTQ2S file, that when that child goes to school, if they’re not met with equality in the classroom in terms of how their families are viewed—and this is all part and parcel of what we’re talking about. Because if they’re not equal before the law, then are they equal anywhere else? It’s arguable. If they’re not equal at the time of birth, then are they really equal when they go to school, when they move through life? We’re talking about children here.", "Again, we’ve all been and come a long way, I think. I was very moved by a friend of mine, Michael Coren, who wrote an article—I think it was in the Star—in response to the uproar over the sex ed curriculum and said exactly what I and others have been saying forever: that really the objection to it is homophobic and transphobic in essence, and pointed out the signs.", "This was the Michael Coren whom I spent months and months debating back in the day around the issue of same-sex marriage. It would be me wearing my collar and him on opposite sides of this issue. We made the media gamut. He was adamant. He had his television show and I would be on it. He’s a constituent of mine. We would agree on many things; we disagreed on that. To see how far he’s come, to the point that he’s written a book about his conversion—because it is a conversion—and that he’s writing articles like the one I read just this morning, is to really see how far many have come in Ontario and many have come in Canada.", "I get that not everybody has had the life experience I’ve had. I get that not all families have had our family’s experience, but when we talk about equality and we talk about parental equality, I think when we reach out and show people that, really, the face of this bill—it’s not the face so much of a parent; it’s the face of a child, a child who is playing, just like all of our children play, no matter what their family background, in the schoolyard. Can you really tell by looking at that child, what they say, how they play, their antics, what kind of family they come from? Whether they’ve got two moms, two dads, two moms and two dads, trans parents, straight parents, queer parents, who cares? At the end of the day, who cares? We shouldn’t care what their family looks like.", "When we talk about trying to diminish the effect of bullying in our schools, how can we say that and then come here and be bullies ourselves in not supporting parent and child equality? How can we come here and say some families are more equal than others, some parents and some children have more rights than others? How can we not model what we ask our teachers and the children in our schools to model? Which is to accept and love each other the way we are. That’s very simple, really. It’s very simple, and there is nothing that is not in the best interests of the child in that. To argue anything else is to argue against the best interests of the child.", "I’ve read personal stories from some amazing and remarkable activists. I have to say that the women sitting here in our galleries and many, many more out there—many more—really looking back over the decades that have brought us to this moment because we are unique in this province, and I think we have a lot to be thankful for, that we actually live in a province that’s come this far—one would argue this fast; I wouldn’t, because it’s 45 years later—come this far on this file. But we’re not there yet, and this’ll put us a step closer.", "Something else that’s coming up: On November 20, we’re going to be recognizing and having—the 21st, I think, is a Monday when the House sits—a moment of silence around trans remembrance day. We’re going to be raising the flag out front, the trans flag, on trans remembrance day—the first time that’s ever happened at Queen’s Park. Last year, I think it was the first time the pride flag went up.", "I remember when Dyke Day first started. I remember actually performing the first legalized same-sex marriage after Brent showed us you could marry by banns—not legally, but you could do it in a church. I thought, “Great; I’ll do that.” I married two women and sent it in. The Registrar General’s office—this was back before the law changed—thought Paula and Blanca were two men’s names. There’s nothing about male and female on the form. They vetted it and it became de facto the first legalized same-sex marriage in North America, actually. We celebrated that by always marching on Dyke Day—them in their wedding dresses and me driving the convertible. It was fun.", "It’s a long history that has brought us here, a long history, and it has been a hard-won history. We’ve lost a lot of people in that history, and by “lost” I mean actually lost. Without going into the AIDS crisis—but there was one, and there still is, and we’re still not dealing with that with any kind of equality. We still have discriminatory blood laws in this country. We still force gay men to go on ODSP just to cover their medication—that’s unconscionable—in this province. We still do that. We still have work to do on that file.", "We still have work to do on the trans file, where 50% live in poverty and 50% have attempted suicide. We still have work to do on that file.", "But today we have a chance to do something to move us ahead, and that is, let’s pass this bill. Let’s get it to committee. Let’s get it looked at in committee. Let’s give everybody a chance to say their piece. Let’s go through it clause by clause—and we will—so that amendments can be made to make it stronger, because it needs to be stronger. It needs to be changed in some pretty important ways.", "Then we will be able to say to Bri and those of her generation, their generation, that when it’s time for you to have children, whatever your family looks like, you won’t even remember a time when you had to go through a whole separate process just to make sure your child was recognized in law. They’ll say to us, “Really? You had to do that back then? Really? You really had to do that? There was something preventing you from doing that? It was only a man and a woman?” We will seem like such dinosaurs.", "So let’s get out of the Jurassic age and into the present. Let’s pass this, at least for second reading. Let’s put it in committee. Let’s recognize all of those who have gone before, all of those incredible activists, many of whom are here and many of whom we should pay tribute to for all their outrageously difficult work to get us here. We’re not quite there yet, but with any luck at all, by Christmas we will be, and that will be the best gift of all." ],

I’m on record almost every time we talk that we are sent here to represent all of the people of our riding. We should be able to take something like this that is truly going to have ramifications, particularly for the families who are going to be involved, and we actually have good, solid debate and put out legislation that is well thought out, articulated, clear and understandable by all in a common manner.", "So if you debate that well, we should be able to find all the what-ifs. We can answer all the types of questions that the member has raised and ensure that we have good, clear legislation, as opposed to what I see with this government.

The courts are already backlogged. FRO is one of those organizations that are backlogged big time because of ambiguity. We don’t want this piece of legislation to be the same.

It stands to reason.", "So it’s a pleasure that the member from Parkdale–High Park was able to bring forward Cy and Ruby’s Act, which was Bill 137. It was her private member’s bill. I remember very clearly being out on the front lawn of this place and meeting with parents who wanted to share their stories with us.", "It’s a very personal story for me, I have to tell you. My sister and her partner, when they started to try to have a family—for same-sex couples, it’s not an easy path, I have to tell you. There’s a lot of cost at stake. It’s not a journey that was, at the time—their son Leo is now 13 years old, who was here actually on the day I was sworn in, and he is my number one fan, next to all the major soccer players in the world. I’m keeping good company.", "But when they were going through this journey as same-sex couples, they ran into stigma at almost every step of the way, from the hospital system to the counselling system to their employers, which were both school boards at the time, when progressive strategies and equity policies actually were not in place in those school boards. Those school boards, quite honestly, have come a long way, and I commend many of them—not all of them, but many of them—for being more inclusive of what a family needs to be.", "This debate for me, though, today in this House stems from what should stimulate and motivate the conversation on Bill 28, the All Families Are Equal Act: what is in the best interests of a child. Today, Leo happens to have four mommies, so he has extra stress but extra love, I like to say. He’s indeed a very fortunate child, and he’s growing up in a world that is so different than the world that I grew up with. I would like to refer to him as a little change-maker, because he tells this story very openly, and with great pride that he has four mommies.", "This bill, though, does make serious amendments to the Children’s Law Reform Act to establish new rules of parentage, ensuring equity in legislation for same-sex partners and any partners using assisted reproduction. The act aims to eliminate the distinction between the person who gives birth and the child’s other parents.", "It did come as a huge surprise to me, as the aunt of my nephew Leo. My sister had given birth, and in order for her partner to have equal rights as a parent, she had to adopt Leo, which was astounding. Of course, my children who had grown up with two aunts just saw them as a family. Children have this innate quality that they just see love where love is, and they see equal parents where equal parents are.", "It was quite a process. I think that, in the end, it cost about $7,000 in legal fees for Julie’s partner to adopt Leo so that she would have equal rights as a parent in the school system, in the health care system, out in that world which is not always so accepting, as we all know.", "This act was a long time coming. As I mentioned, it does make those amendments to the Children’s Law Reform Act. Related amendments are also made to the Vital Statistics Act to reflect those rules as they affect birth registrations. Of course, other complementary amendments are made to various statutes to reflect the new rules of parentage.", "Even this morning, reading the Toronto Star editorial about the need to—really, it is a conversation that is happening across this province. The editorial this morning specifically had to do with children’s aid societies and the need to have a race-related lens applied to the decisions that are made in that organization. Of course, they need the corresponding resources to ensure that that education and that training does, in fact, happen.", "But it ultimately comes down to what makes a good parent. If you had been on the front lawn of the Legislature when gay pride month was actually announced—gay pride week, gay pride month—it was a huge celebration. All the families had come out and were part of this celebration, which was finally acknowledging them as equals. Cy and Ruby were actually there that morning and had obviously given a lot of praise to the member from Parkdale–High Park. So that’s all good. The intention of the bill clearly is good. It is absolutely moving in the right direction.", "There are some policy effectiveness issues that, for very good reason, we as New Democrats have some issues with, and some questions. There are parts of the bill that stakeholders are obviously not fully satisfied with because they have the lived experience of trying to navigate through these social systems—social constructs, if you will; and of course, we are going to be tabling some amendments to ensure that some of those roadblocks don’t exist.", "The first piece, though, is that the bill elevates the importance of the biological father at the expense of the birth parent, and those are obviously overwhelmingly women. The focus on biology in section 7 could cause some issues. It also makes it harder for a woman to give her child up for adoption, as an unknown father would need to give consent.", "Secondly, a parent who is not the birth parent but is the partner would still need a declaration under the current draft to get certainty. So this is still a very subjective piece to the legislation. Section 8 makes them a presumptive parent, but puts no limits on what can rebut the presumption.", "Any good piece of legislation, as you know, needs to have clarity. When there are grey areas, then there are, of course, conflicts as they relate to the law. The section needs to establish parentage except where a spouse does not consent. Same-sex parents seemingly remain second-class citizens.", "I think the language that we will be putting forward and the language that the member from Parkdale–High Park will be using will make it clearer and less subjective. But there’s no doubt about this. What my sister-in-law and my sister had to do was go to court and go through an adoption process, and that should never have had to happen, I think, if there was this premise of equality in the province of Ontario.", "Around mixed reviews, the section on declarations also precludes a declaration on adoption. Often, same-sex couples who adopt internationally must do a single-parent adoption. Currently, those parents can get a declaration for the second parent. Under this bill, they are not able to do so.", "That does raise the bigger issue of how difficult it is to adopt a child in the province of Ontario. In our own region of Waterloo, there have been some companies, some private companies, that have actively gone into the business of trying to facilitate the process of international adoptions. In one case, criminal charges have been laid because there was a violation from a financial and an ethical perspective. So it is not the adoption sector, if you will. It is not easy in the province of Ontario to adopt a child, even though there are many loving and giving parents out there, where all constructs of families would like to adopt a child. It’s a lengthy process.", "The issue of international adoptions is extra-complex because of the cost affiliated with it and because the regulations as they pertain in the current act are not very clear. This is an outstanding issue where a same-sex couple who would like to adopt internationally could only use a single parent name to do so. This sort of doubles down, for us, on what would amount to a discriminatory practice. Both parents are looking to adopt a child, and both parents should be listed as those parents, and that would be a huge improvement to Bill 28 where all parents are equal.", "The bill imposes numerous limitations on declarations for multi-parent families as well. The courts have determined that it could be in that particular child’s best interest to have three parents. It makes the timing of the intention to parent together determinative, when this may not reflect the reality of the child’s best interest. Instead, experienced family law judges should still have a measure of discretion that the child’s best interest should govern. This does play into the concerns that we heard from the PC caucus around having an onerous process for family law. Well, why don’t we fix the family law system, instead of adopting or adapting this piece of legislation to accommodate a family law system which is clearly struggling, frayed and—by all accounts, including some evidence-based reports that we’ve heard from the Ontario advocate, for instance—not very child-friendly?", "Now, there are courts across the province that are looking to actually make those Family Court systems more inclusive, more compassionate, like the Child Witness Centre in Kitchener–Waterloo, which is really looking to help make it such a traumatic experience—because it is. Going through the Family Court system is not where you think you’ll end up as a child and, in many cases, it is not where you think you’ll end up as a parent. So I would challenge the premise from the PC caucus that this would be onerous from the Family Court system because the Family Court system is already overwhelmed. Let’s fix the Family Court system and make sure every child who enters into that system and every family that goes into that system actually does feel supported as they move forward.", "We are obviously going to continue to push for quick passage of this legislation. We should, of course, be very clear about some of the stories. When legislation comes to this place, we do have a responsibility as parliamentarians to give that legislation its due course and to speak to it from the perspective of our own lived experiences, but also those of people from our ridings.", "Certainly the community from Kitchener–Waterloo is very receptive and very supportive of the work that the member from Parkdale–High Park has been doing on this file, which is essentially about equality. It’s about challenging the rhetoric on equality and bringing that to a place where it is the law and it is not optional. Some of the stories that we have had the opportunity to bear witness to, some of the challenges that we’ve had the great misfortune to have to witness in sort of a helpless state, if you will, as the years have passed are quite heartbreaking.", "When I go back to my own experience in my own family and the fact that my nephew had to be essentially adopted by his parents, I’m very supportive of the fact that that would no longer have to happen. The amendments I have mentioned that we as a party will be bringing forward should be adopted by all sides of the House, and we should definitely get this done.", "There’s no reason for these challenges to come into the court system, as they have for years now. We have the opportunity to do the right thing in this place, as we should. I commend the member from Parkdale–High Park for her resiliency on this file. Let’s make sure that we get this piece of legislation right, going forward, and let’s do good in this place." ],

Firstly, Bill 2, if passed, will lower the maximum contribution amount to $1,200 for a nomination contestant or constituency association, $1,200 for a candidate, and $1,200 for a leadership contestant. That will lower the maximum contribution amount from $33,250, under the current system, to just over $3,600. That represents a 90% reduction.", "Secondly, we’re banning corporate and union donations. Too often, people hear about a donation to either the governing party or to the opposition from a corporation or a union with a stake in provincial legislation. Now, we’ve been quite clear on this side of the House that donations do not purchase policy decisions for our government, but nonetheless, we understand that corporate and union donations can create the perception of this influence, and they need to be removed. I think we have agreement on this point. In fact, we’ve heard from the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington that “getting rid of corporate and union donations—absolutely fine”; and from the member from Kitchener–Waterloo that, “We support it, a full ban on union and corporate donations.” We appreciate that support, Mr. Speaker, but we do know that we need to go further.", "The Premier has already directed caucus to stop hosting large-scale fundraisers where ministers interact solely with stakeholders of their portfolio, and the Premier has required that all fundraisers be posted publicly. Sometimes we haven’t seen the opposition follow the Premier’s lead on this issue, but we believe, on this side of the House, that that’s the type of openness and transparency that Ontarians deserve. That’s why, if passed, Bill 2 would require parties to publicly post all fundraisers on their website.", "In our efforts to remove the perception of undue influence, we need to recognize that there are other avenues that groups can use, including pouring millions into political advertising. That’s why Bill 2 would place restrictions on third-party advertising. Now, again, to be clear, we understand that third parties have every right to advocate for their issues and generate awareness of their causes. That’s why, in this legislation, we’ve allowed third-party advertising spending of up to $100,000 during the 30-day writ period and up to $600,000 for the six months preceding the writ period. We’ve also instituted strict anti-collusion measures to prevent third parties from getting around the rules.

In fact, the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington recently said, on the subject of third-party advertising, “We’ve gone significant strides in the right direction.” That’s in reference to the legislation. So I want to thank the member for his comments, for his interest and for his dedication to this subject in the Legislature and for his support of our initiatives.", "Going further, I know that the member is interested in amendments that have been announced and will be tabled at second reading. We’ve already said that, in our opinion, the perception of any undue influence over politicians weakens our democracy. That’s why we are planning to take the extraordinary step of tabling amendments to ban MPPs from attending events where the explicit aim is to fundraise. We believe that our duties as legislators and as politicians don’t begin when you take a seat in this House; rather, they begin the second you put your name forward. That’s why we’ve expanded this ban to include candidates, nomination and leadership contestants and party leaders. This prohibition won’t prevent people from making donations to a political party. It’s our expectation that parties will still need to rely on donors, and this is a good thing. Indeed, as the honourable David Wake, the province’s Integrity Commissioner, said, “Donations are important because they contribute to healthy political parties.” We could not agree more. Bill 2 would simply force contestants, parties and candidates to expand their base of support to a larger number of people making smaller contributions. That’s grassroots democracy in action. We think this builds a stronger democracy and a fairer democracy.", "Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to speak about the per-vote allowance being introduced with this bill. If passed, the bill would lower the maximum amount that can be donated by 90%, ban corporate and union contributions and, with the announced amendments, it would ban MPPs from attending fundraising events. These are significant changes, and the Chief Electoral Officer recommended that if we’re lowering donations, we should increase the per-vote allowance as a result. That’s why we’re introducing a $2.71 per-vote allowance with this bill. This will, to an extent, connect the monetary success of a party with the political success of a party. The allowance will be reduced by 25% over the next five years and then reviewed to determine if it should continue.", "Mr. Speaker, these changes will create a more level playing field. They will create a more grassroots democracy in which everyone has a fair opportunity to participate and support politicians and political initiatives of their choice.", "I encourage all MPPs to support this, as I know they will." ],

Yet today they’re standing up using words like “sensible reasons” and “tolerable.”", "I find it interesting that until the media really caught them, as my colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh said, with their fingers in the cookie jar, there was nothing wrong with the system. They were gaming it just fine. They were filling the coffers as much as they could and maintaining that distinct advantage that they had as government.", "I’m wondering what happened now. Is this an admission of guilt that they actually were gaming the system? Now, because the public and the media and the opposition have done such a good job, they’re coming out.", "I want to ask the members opposite why they voted down the Auditor General’s request to reinstate oversight powers for the Auditor General. If there’s nothing that they’re worried about, if there’s nothing that they’re doing wrong, why will they not allow the Auditor General, who used to have the power to do oversight, to do it?", "We had, I believe, 50-plus amendments from the PC party to actually amend this bill, to truly make it able to serve the people of Ontario. Yet there’s one distinct one that Auditor General has asked for, and they’ve declined. It needs to be about the people." ],

We didn’t actually know we were going to be speaking to this bill but are happy to have the opportunity.", "Mr. Speaker, the reason this bill is before us today is because the government got caught. They got caught. It was well-documented by Adrian Morrow in the Globe and Mail, in a series of articles about their cash-for-access plan they had going on. When that was exposed, all of a sudden the government had to react to it. We heard stories and read about how senior ministers had quotas, targets—whatever you want to call it—goals of $500,000 for senior ministers like the Minister of Finance. That’s how much money they were expected to raise for the Liberal Party.", "That is just not right, Mr. Speaker, because who are they going to raise the money from? Well, if you’re the Minister of Finance, it’s going to be all the various stakeholders that you’re dealing with, the very people that you’re going to be making laws with regard to; that’s who you’re going to raise money from. And if you don’t think that these people coming to a fundraiser and, we heard, in the case of the energy sector, paying $6,000 for a ticket. If you don’t think they’re going to want to have some influence over policy for paying that $6,000, I think you have your head in the sand.", "We see how in the energy sector—you read the Auditor General’s report, who is non-partisan and documents how we paid $9.2 billion more than we needed to, to get the existing renewable energy infrastructure. We overspent $9.2 billion to some 30 companies. Well, it just so happens that those 30 companies also donated $1.3 million to the Liberal Party. So we’re getting really bad policy because this pay-for-access program has been permitted. But the reason we’re debating this bill is because it was exposed what the government was doing, and it’s just wrong.", "In this bill it also deals with third-party advertising. We’ve seen in the last number of elections how there have been groups like the Working Families coalition, a group of mainly unions, that have targeted very successfully, usually, the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. They have spent millions and millions and millions on negative advertising, usually making the leader out to be some terrible person and various other things. We read that the last election they spent, I believe, $8.6 million—totally outside the election rules—strictly aimed toward defeating the PC Party and leader.", "That’s not a level playing field, Mr. Speaker. That is something that is being dealt with a little bit in this bill, although it was noted by some of the previous speakers that there would still be $600,000 allowed to be spent in the six months prior to the writ, is what I believe I heard. In my opinion, that’s still far too much money. If enough unions or whoever, corporations or whatever, are each spending $600,000, it will add up to millions of dollars of advertising again. That’s just too much money, too much influence being affected by special-interest groups. I don’t think that’s a good thing.", "It was noted that one of the things they haven’t done in this bill is that they aren’t putting back in the oversight that the Auditor General used to have over government advertising. Because one of the things—and it was pointed out by the Auditor General—that is not the level playing field that the government is talking about is that the government has an unfair advantage.", "First of all, backing up, the government passed legislation last year lowering the bar, lowering the oversight of the Auditor General over what is partisan advertising. So now the government can effectively do partisan advertising and that’s outside of election rules. Well, there’s only one party that’s the government. So they can spend millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money on ads that are partisan, and that creates an unlevel playing field.", "I believe the auditor pointed out that, in her opinion, the ads run by the government to do with climate change featuring Dr. David Suzuki were partisan because they weren’t talking about a specific bill at all. So that was a demonstration—and I believe she gave other demonstrations—of how the government is doing partisan advertising. That is not being changed in this bill. In fact, as I mentioned, the government went out of their way to pass legislation to give themselves an unfair advantage in an election. I think that’s a bad thing.", "The idea that the government suddenly decided that MPPs shouldn’t be able to do any fundraising: I think this is absolutely ridiculous. It’s trying to make it look like individual MPPs are somehow the same as a minister holding a $1,000-per-person fundraiser with stakeholders. The idea that an MPP holding some chicken barbecue in their riding for whatever—in my case, I do one fundraiser a year in the riding. It’s a golf tournament. Over four years, it raises enough money to pay for a provincial election campaign, which is not a lot of money, in the grand scheme of things, for individual MPPs. Somehow saying that that’s like selling access is ridiculous. I think it hurts. It hurts the riding associations. It hurts democracy, really, because I don’t think anyone going to those dinners—they may be supporters, but I don’t feel like they’re buying influence of any kind. They’re just being supportive. It’s raising a bit of money for a riding association so that members can buy signs and spend the little bit of money that’s required for an MPP to run an election campaign. I see absolutely nothing wrong with that. Banning candidates from participating is going to be bad for democracy.", "I do believe, when you look at the United States—I think they really need rules there regarding spending in elections. If you’re a senator there, it’s hundreds of millions of dollars. If you’re running to be President, it’s billions of dollars. You kind of see the result you get down there. I think that’s one of the basic things wrong with the US system that needs to be cleaned up.", "But here, for individual MPPs doing very minor fundraising—I think it’s a good thing in Ontario that you don’t have to be wealthy to be able to be an MPP. When I look back at my initial nomination meeting, I might have spent a few hundred dollars printing up a brochure to run to be the PC—to win the nomination. I didn’t have to fork over any money to run in the provincial election that ensued after that. With the current rules, it’s reasonably easy, with a bit of work over four years, for an MPP to be able to raise some money. I think that part of the system is just fine.", "I do think it’s wrong that the leaders of political parties, under our current system, have to spend so much time doing fundraising for the benefit of their individual political party. Whether the answer to that is a subsidy I think is something that’s up for debate, and it would probably be something that the people of this province would want to have some say over. I know the government is proposing—I believe it’s $2; I heard $2.71 per vote, which, in some of the articles I read, would mean that the Liberal Party would get something like over $4 million a year, the PCs over $3 million, the Green Party $550,000. I am not sure what the NDP would get based on the last election." ],

We are told, on this legislation, that there are going to be big changes coming, but no, we’re not going to debate them in this reading, which leads you to the question of, why are we actually debating this legislation? If the government has announced that there are going to be big changes, you would think that it would be better if these big changes were included in the legislation and then these changes had the possibility of being amended—and that muddies the debate arena even further.

I don’t mind when the government advertises a program: “Here’s how you access the program.” The improved rural rebate for delivery charges—if an ad came on saying, “Here is who is going to qualify,” that is something that the government should do. That would be good. But that’s not the kind of advertising that we see. A good example is, a little while ago there were ads about how the government is improving your ability to collect a pension, but that was after their own legislation was pulled. They’re discussing with the federal government, yet the government is spending taxpayers’ money saying they’re doing a good job on the pension issue.

We’re very much hoping that what we see in the papers before us now is what we get: that third-party fundraising will be controlled, limited and small; that fundraising for the parties from individuals and corporations will be limited; and that we get back to the business of thinking about what politicians should be doing, which is, “How do we help people?” versus spending so much time thinking about fundraising. What happened recently with the government giving quotas to ministers to fundraise is something that we all find unpalatable, and it has to stop." ],

We don’t charge for having appointments with stakeholders, so I think that it’s unfair to say that it’s cash-for-access if we have a fundraiser, but if you have a fundraiser it’s called something different. The fact is that we all have fundraisers. We need to have fundraisers in order to be able to run an election campaign.

The impetus is on us to do the right thing. We are going to change the way politics is done in Ontario, but the opposition isn’t happy.

Sometimes you’re there all night. Maybe 100 people would show up. I think I can speak for the other parties locally or the other candidates—whether they be Liberal or NDP, Green Party, Christian Heritage, various groups that run—that it’s always an interesting night. Those in the audience, as we know in this business, have pretty well made up their minds before they arrive. It’s usually a fairly interesting evening. The media are there.

Oftentimes, certainly in the early days of a candidate, it’s from friends, from neighbours. I know that when I first ran for the nomination, my parents gave me their address book. It wasn’t a Rolodex. It was an address book of their friends and family. We would spend many, many hours writing letters and putting stamps on envelopes and receiving, back then, maybe $20 or $25 from people you knew, people who knew you. Perhaps they knew your reputation, perhaps knew your family or how you ran your farm.", "What was the money for? In my case, and I do spend very little money during an election, it’s to update the signs, buy new signs, print some literature, print some brochures.

I have maybe golfed six times in my life so far, and the last three, I think, have been at what’s called the Toby Tee-Off. It wasn’t my suggestion for that name. Maybe 25 of us show up. It’s in Port Rowan, down in the far south—it would be the southwest corner of my riding. It’s probably closer to Cleveland than it is to Toronto. But we like to have a presence down there. People like us to come down. It’s a very small golf course. It’s called the Toby Tee-Off. If we are to run that next spring, we’ll get 25 people out; they’ll pay $40.

Now, this is after first reading. Just so your viewers understand, normally bills don’t get consulted until after second reading. This one went for consultations all over Ontario; for example, in Ottawa, Kingston, Toronto, Kitchener–Waterloo, London and Windsor. We heard from people all over the province at first reading. So there have been a lot of consultations and, actually, amendments that went into that.", "The other thing was a concern that I’ve heard expressed that what we want to do is stop big-money fundraisers. In fact, that’s what this bill would actually do, because Bill 2, if passed, would lower the maximum contribution amount to $1,200 for nomination contestants or constituency associations, $1,200 for a candidate in an election, and $1,200 for a leadership contestant. In fact, the givings are being very much capped by this bill. By definition, the whole notion of big-money events and big-money contributions will be reduced, so that—" ],

But they voted unanimously.", "The Attorney General, in his comments, suggested, “Pick a lane.” I would suggest to him that in October he voted against it, and today it’s all the thing that we have to do. I suggest he might have wanted to pick a lane. Why did he vote against mine? Why did he and his government unanimously not act on the Elections Ontario officer’s recommendations, which have been put in front of them at least twice, maybe three times, and prior to the last election, I’ll suggest.", "Also, it sets a trend here that they actually disregard all of the legislative officers. The AG wanted to have oversight put back in so that she could scrutinize whether there were partisan ads and to clarify that perception of the government taking advantage of funding that they have at their disposal leading up to an election. But they went against that.", "Martin Regg Cohn, on March 29, wrote an article in the Toronto Star where he suggested that targets for top ministers range from $250,000 to $500,000, with health, finance and energy ministers at the top. Former MPP and Minister of Finance Dwight Duncan is quoted in that same article as saying, “As Minister of Finance you are in a portfolio where people want to see you, and they’ll pay for it.”", "In the same Star story, former Liberal Attorney General John Gerretsen talks about how cabinet ministers or their staff get a call from Bobby Walman, the president and chief fundraising officer of the Ontario Liberal Fund, suggesting that, again, they want to make a call to say, “If you want to see cabinet, we need some money here.” I’m paraphrasing, of course, but in essence, that’s the perception that was in the public.", "It needs to be addressed.

We should be looking at this bill through the lens of how it affects the people of this province.", "It’s just been a charade, the entire process.

It should also be a concern to the public, to the people who it’s actually ultimately going to affect, because at the heart of our society is our government, and at the heart of our government is our democracy, and elections are about democracy. So when we are formulating this legislation, we’re really speaking to our democracy.", "When we look at where we are at this point, how we got here—and we’ve said this, and it’s legit: The Premier did say that she sat at her kitchen table, writing her ideas on the back of a napkin. We all have brainstorm ideas, we write quick lists etc., but we don’t base legislation on them. The reason that this bill, Bill 2, came about is because the government was caught. When you are caught doing something you shouldn’t have been doing—and I’ll equate this to, let’s say, you’re going to change your eating habits and you’re going to make sure you’re eating healthy in the house, and all of a sudden you’re caught with your hand in a bag of potato chips. Someone in your family catches you. What’s your first reaction going to be? Most people would say, “Gee, I’m wrong. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have been indulging in these chips because of health reasons. I apologize and I was wrong, and we need to correct this.” But not this government.

There were amendments that the NDP put forward.", "When you talk about a democratic process, we are supposed to listen. Listening isn’t just nodding your head when someone is speaking; it’s active listening. You listen to their ideas. You may not agree with all of it, but you take something from it and you work with it because those suggestions, those recommendations, those amendments have merit. Once you turn yourself off to listening to another voice, that isn’t a democratic process. That’s an exercise in a fake democratic process.", "Speaker, I want to talk about the significant amendment that we brought forward, and that was the conflict of interest, because that’s what this is about. We talked about perception of conflict of interest: how the public sees things, how things can get massaged and spun to show a certain perception. We have the opportunity not to do that. We have the opportunity to peel back that perception and actually have the integrity officer have oversight over the conflict of interest. Wouldn’t it make the public feel better that there’s an actual process, so that if a member has an issue and makes a bad judgment—like putting their hand in that bag of chips when they were trying to stay on their diet—somebody is going to say, “Wait a minute. That’s not a good choice. You need to step back from those chips. You need to step back from that fundraiser, and we should be reviewing your conflict of interest.”", "Let’s have a serious conversation, because when all is said and done, legislation is very important. It rules our democracy. If we can’t get the legislation correct, if we can’t get buy-in from other MPPs and other representatives, if we can’t get buy-in from the public, then what is it about? Is it about power? Is it about democracy? If it’s about power, this government has a majority government, so they have the power to do what they wish. But a good government, a democratic government, will pay attention to the other parties and they will extrapolate those good ideas and they will implement them in the legislation.", "I don’t think it’s far-reaching, as the minister of aboriginal affairs said. He actually said that this legislation is meaningful, far-reaching and comprehensive. If you would like to have legislation that’s meaningful, far-reaching and comprehensive, I would like to see a conflict-of-interest clause in there. I would like to see the Integrity Commissioner have oversight over that piece because that’s what we are discussing here. We’re talking about conflict of interest. We’re talking about cabinet ministers taking money for access. And that perception is there and that perception is real.", "So what is wrong with having an Integrity Commissioner review conflict of interest? That’s actually responsible. It’s responsible legislation. It’s accountable legislation. This government, whether they want to admit it or not, has a problem with accountability and transparency, and whether they want to believe it or not, we are here to guide them into making legislation that’s accountable and transparent to the people we represent.", "When there was a minority government, Speaker, we had many more people wanting to meet with us. And do you know why? Because of the perception of influence: We had a voice in a minority government because, if you didn’t have our support, the government would crash, the government would cease. An election would be called. So now we’re here at a majority government and that isn’t taken into consideration. Now they have the power. They have the power to make legislation without the support of oppositional parties. And that’s the sad part.", "So if you want meaningful, far-reaching and comprehensive legislation, look at the amendments. Look at the amendments that hold you accountable and hold every MPP in this House accountable and transparent to the people who elected them. That’s what the Election Act should be about. It shouldn’t be about who can go where and who can fundraise or who can attend each other’s fundraiser. It should be about conflict of interest, transparency and accountability. Because if you go to your fundraiser—a spaghetti dinner or a steak dinner—and you have done it all legit, by the guidelines that are set out, if there’s a conflict of interest we won’t be able to determine that because there’s no oversight for conflict of interest. When people lose their way, we need to bring them back in. We need to reel it in.", "I really ask this government to reconsider the amendments and make good on the conflict of interest because the people are disappointed. I’ll tell you, when I speak to my constituents, people want to know why this government has gotten away with so many things. They want to know why this government has got away with cancelling the gas plants scandals and no repercussions, no penalties, absolutely nothing. They want to know why they got away with Ornge. How could that have been set up like that, that financial piece? Money was taken out of the public purse and again, no accountability and no consequences for this government. They want to know these things. Then, we come up with legislation that takes away that oversight.", "I don’t think this is a good piece of legislation, unless you actually seriously consider the amendments brought forward that actually make this legislation responsible to the public, who we are responsible to. And that’s what the member from Kitchener–Waterloo said.

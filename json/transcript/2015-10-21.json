  "text" : [ "Great speech. On behalf of the NDP caucus, we would like to agree with most of it.", "What time allocation is, really, if you think about it, is a failure by the governing party to actually work in a democratic system. That’s what time allocation is. Because the way the system is supposed to work is, the government has every right to put forward a bill, and it’s the opposition’s role to bring forward the comments and changes, or their opposition to the bill, in order to make it better. It’s the duty and the responsibility of opposition members to be able to speak to this bill and try to make it better, to try to either change the government’s mind on the whole bill, or to try to make improvements. That’s our duty.", "With time allocation, the government is basically saying, “We know better, and we’re going to shut you down.” It’s especially egregious with this government, who were elected on a pledge of openness and transparency. Time allocation is the exact opposite. It’s the exact opposite. As I’ve said, it’s a failure of them to be able to work within a democracy. In a majority government, they should be able to talk to the other parties. There would be some bills that we don’t have a problem with, that we could move through the Legislature faster.", "There are some bills, as this one—there are some major problems in this bill, and myself and my colleagues will expand on that a bit later in the limited time we have. That’s a big problem with time allocation, because they’re limiting the time for members to propose changes here in this House. Even more egregious, and perhaps most egregious, is that they’re limiting the time of people, everyday people, who should be able to participate in democracy. They’re limiting their time by limiting the time of committee hearings and also by limiting where committee meetings are held.", "If you look at this bill, Bill 112, it has two main issues; the one issue is door-to-door sales, retail sales of electricity, stuff like that, which we’ve all had experience with. It’s a huge problem, but it’s not just a huge problem in downtown Toronto, where these hearings are going to be held. It’s a huge problem in one of my colleagues’ ridings, Kenora–Rainy River. It’s a huge problem in Timiskaming–Cochrane. I’m sure it’s a huge problem in ridings across this province. I’m sure people who have dealt with this in ridings across this province would appreciate the opportunity to be able to participate in the process of making a law that is going to help curb this problem.", "But this government has decided that, “No, not only are we not going to listen to the opposition, but we’re not going to listen to the people who are actually impacted by this.” This government is saying, “We know better.” They claim to be open and transparent, but deep down they are telling the people of Ontario, “No, we know better.” That is perhaps the most egregious thing about time allocation.", "This government system, our parliamentary democracy system, has been developed over hundreds of years, and it works. But time allocation is a chip against this parliamentary democracy; it really is. People outside of this House think, “Oh, well, they just want to get things done fast.” We’re not making breakfast here; we’re making laws—laws that stand for years and years; laws that can help people or laws that can hurt people.", "Many of my members would like to be able to have the chance to speak to this bill because they have had people who were impacted by door-to-door retail salespeople. Some people don’t even know. I’ll give a personal example. My mom recently moved to a retirement home, and as we were helping with selling the house and cleaning it out, I discovered that my mom had a door-to-door retail contract and was paying way too much for natural gas, unbeknownst to me, the MPP. I’m sure that happens to people all across the province.", "So the more we could talk about this issue and bring this issue out, the better it would be for the people of Ontario. Why couldn’t we have a committee hearing in Thunder Bay or in North Bay or in Woodstock or in the Minister of Agriculture’s riding in Peterborough? Why couldn’t we have committee hearings throughout the province on this issue? Why? Because the government doesn’t want to talk about this issue." ],

What this bill does—you can’t actually sign the contract. Those people can still approach people like my mom and do a fantastic sales job and do a big pressure job. They just can’t do the deal on the doorstep. They have to call back. On the other side, where they say this is banning door-to-door sales, it’s not.", "But there’s another part of this bill. This is the part I think they really don’t want to talk about, and that’s why they’re doing everything they can to keep this on the down-low. They’re taking some of the Ontario Energy Board’s powers away when it comes to transmission. You’re saying, “These two things have nothing to with each other,” and they don’t. That’s why this bill is being time-allocated, so they can rush it through without people really figuring out what’s going on.", "Out there, a lot of people don’t pay attention to politics, and sometimes for good reason. But on this one, it’s a very important issue. As we all know, the government is talking about—well, they’re doing more than talking about it now. The garage sale, the fire sale is starting for Hydro One. They don’t want to talk about that either, but this bill has something to do with that. The government keeps saying we’re protected by the OEB, the Ontario Energy Board, right? But this bill, while we’re talking about protecting consumers, is taking power away from the OEB and putting it into the government. Really, that’s the issue.", "Yes, we are going to be supporting this bill on second reading, but there have to be some major changes done in this bill for it actually to be a benefit to the people of Ontario.", "When they change the rules for transmission—we have people in Ontario who don’t have transmission lines going into their communities. The government says, “This will help them.” There’s no guarantee this will help them. If they privatize Hydro One, how are these people ever going to be guaranteed that someday they will actually be connected to transmission lines?", "This bill needs to have a very fulsome discussion, and that’s why the government is time-allocating this. They are talking about openness and transparency and how they want to have everyone’s input.", "I’ve been an MPP for four years, and I often wonder how it is that the things we should be debating—and the people they should be consulting—we aren’t, and the things we don’t need to debate, we are. This one, we need to debate. On this one, there should be consultation across the province.", "The Minister of Tourism and Culture is here. We’re doing culture consultations across the province. I’m not opposed. I think that’s a good thing. The more people we consult on issues that impact people across the province, the better it is.", "But on the other side, why don’t we have consultations on an issue like this one? Why don’t we have a committee hearing in somewhere other than Queen’s Park? Why? Why is it important for culture yet not important for something that’s going to impact people perhaps for generations? That is the contradiction of this place.", "That’s why time allocation shouldn’t be part of our standing orders. Unfortunately, it is, and our party was part of that. I’m not going to deny that. But it was a mistake. For a majority government to have to time-allocate time after time, specifically on bills like this one which have a big impact on people, is shameful.", "We can predict that when the contradiction of this bill comes forward, the government will say, “Well, don’t these people want to stop door-to-door sales?” Of course we do. But they won’t talk about how they’re taking away the power of the OEB with this same bill. It’s two bills, and they’re trying to slip one under. That’s very egregious, especially from a government that claims to be open and transparent.", "In the short time we have left, some of my colleagues will want to continue on this, so I’ll leave the rest of our time to my colleagues." ],

How are you improving the quality of life in our community?” That’s one of the questions.", "The other thing that recently came up, and I mentioned this before when I spoke to the bill a couple of weeks ago, was that when I told them about some of the things that were in this bill, particularly around banning the door-to-door sales, everybody in the room was nodding their heads and saying, “This is absolutely necessary.”", "One of the folks asked me after the meeting, “When is this going to get done?” I said to them, “Well, it depends on how long it’s debated and how long the legislative process takes.” When I think about that and when I think about the fact that the people in that room and the people in my community want to make sure that a lot of other things also get done to enhance the quality of life for the people of Ontario, I think it’s really important that we get to the business of getting things done on behalf of the seniors who were in that room and on behalf of the people of my community and the people of all the communities that we represent.", "Let me highlight a few points. The people in that room and the people of Ontario sent us a clear message last June when we were elected that they wanted us to get a lot done. There has been considerable debate on this bill.", "I know that the member for Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke spoke about the fact that there were few members on his side who had spoken to the bill. I’m not sure why that is. It can only be one of two reasons: either the members on the opposite side aren’t excited about protecting consumers or the members on the opposite side are being prevented from speaking to the bill. Either way, they’ve had the opportunity to speak to it. In total, there have been 40 members who have spoken to this bill—40—so for the member to suggest that there hasn’t been an opportunity for the members to speak is not accurate at all. I think we all know that. The Legislature has been working and members have been speaking to this bill.", "The other thing I’d like to say is that by moving this on to committee, what this allows is it allows stakeholders to come forward and for the committee to review the bill. There are members from all parties at that committee. They can consider the bill, speak to the bill, ask questions and make it even stronger.", "But the best part about this is that we can get to—and we already know that members of the other parties have said they’re going to support the bill, so we know what the outcome will be. In fact, we know that. The member for Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke provided some interesting quotes. The quote I’d like to provide is from the member for Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, who stated: “I do want to say that we’re going to support this legislation....” The member for Windsor–Tecumseh stated, “This is legislation that at the heart has a good intent. I think on this side of the House we will be supporting it.” If that’s where we’re going to go, there is an opportunity here to bring it to committee and make it better, if there are any concerns.", "There is an urgent need to protect consumers. The people at those seniors’ meetings in my community care about that, the people in my community broadly care about that and the people of Ontario care about that.", "The other thing that the people of Ontario want us to work on is a whole range of other issues. There is a number of pieces of legislation that have been introduced which we want to debate and I’m sure the people in our communities would want us to debate and get to work on so that we can get things done on their behalf: Bill 85, the good government act; Bill 109, the employment and labour statute act; Bill 113, the Police Record Checks Reform Act; Bill 115, the Electoral Boundaries Act, and I could go on. These are important pieces of legislation that enhance the lives of Ontarians, of the people in my community of Etobicoke Centre.", "Speaker, I started by talking about the people in those seniors’ meetings who I meet with on a monthly basis, who tell me how they want us to get things done on their behalf.

Instead, we’re talking about time allocation and the amendment to that motion. That’s all very interesting.", "Last week, Speaker, I had a young woman from—Angela Thompson was her name. She came all the way down from St. Thomas to visit me in my Windsor office to talk about the selling off of Ontario hydro. I was hoping to talk about her today. She works in a group home and her boyfriend runs a small business. She’s reaching out to MPPs of all political stripes because she’s outraged and appalled because this government is selling Hydro One. I think she’d be outraged and appalled that they’re bringing in time allocation on this bill, making this a motion and an amendment to the motion that we have to talk about today.", "She told me she thought the Liberal government, which wants us to trust it, was being “really sneaky,” in her words, and “untruthful,” in her words. She took a day off work to come down to my office to drive home the point that while we make it sound positive to use words like “broaden the ownership,” those words disguise the negative reality of the Liberals trying to sell hydro. I only mention that because she did drive all the way down from St. Thomas. She felt tricked; she felt taken in. I feel the same way when they bring in time allocation motions. I just feel as Angela Thompson did.", "She also told me she tried to get an appointment with the member from London North Centre, the Deputy Premier, Ms. Matthews. My door is always open, but, apparently, if you want to see certain members of the House, you have to apply online and go through a screening process before you get in the door. I didn’t know about that. I don’t know if it’s true, but she told me that she can’t get in to see the member because she doesn’t pass, I guess, the test. That might be a member’s way of saying “Get off my porch.” I don’t know, but I know, when people come into my office, we have an open-door policy. We don’t always agree with everyone who comes in, but at least we give them the time they need to state their case.", "In this House, we like to think we take the time we need to speak on a bill, that it gets a full hearing. Instead, we get time allocation imposed on us, and then the amendments to that motion so that we can’t talk about it.", "Speaker, I know my time is rapidly running out and I know the member from Essex wants to get in on this as well. I just say, it saddens me and disappoints me that we don’t have an opportunity to discuss this sugar-coated weasel bill that was being presented, Instead, we have to talk about a time allocation motion and amendments to the motion. Indeed, a lot of people do feel tricked by this.", "The Ontario Energy Board is like a gatekeeper. They hold public hearings, and, if you want to do something like build a transmission line, you have to meet their needs test, but this bill would strip that away. We wouldn’t have the public hearings; we’d strip away the power of the Ontario Energy Board and give it to the cabinet table where, should they choose to take a proposal from a friend and call it a priority project, then that would get government approval, where other people in the queue waiting to have a needs test put on their proposal—say, down Leamington way—in order get power lines in to feed the greenhouses, the queue would be jumped by the friends of cabinet who would have their projects approved.", "I guess I’m out of time. At this, I will sit down." ],

The Canadian theme this year is, “Her Story, Our Story: Celebrating Canadian Women.” It’s a fitting one since Women’s History Month highlights the rich role women and girls have played in our history. Appropriately, the United Nations International Day of the Girl Child fell earlier this month on October 11. I’m also happy to add that this month, we’re launching the 10th annual Leading Women/Leading Girls Building Communities Recognition Program.", "Depuis ses débuts en 2006, ce programme a reconnu les contributions démontrant le leadership de plus de 745 femmes et filles dans leur collectivité.", "Last year, we received 95 nominations from MPPs. Nominations are now open for 2016, and I look forward to an even greater number this year. I encourage every member to nominate deserving female leaders in their riding.", "Another occasion we celebrated this month was Persons Day, which falls on the 18th of October every year. In the 1920s, the so-called Famous Five group of prominent Canadian women fought for all women in this country to be declared persons. In 1929, they won their case and opened the door for women to run for the Senate and other political office. Sans la détermination de ces cinq femmes, beaucoup d’entre nous, moi y comprise, ne seraient peut-être pas ici aujourd’hui.", "Since 1929, and since Agnes Macphail became Ontario’s first female MPP in 1943, we’ve come a long way towards our goal of total equality for women. Women enjoy full voting rights and full equality rights under section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.", "All the members here should have received by now an invitation from me to host a Persons Day breakfast in their constituencies. My office has provided material to support all members in commemorating this very important occasion.", "As the minister responsible for women’s issues, I can say that we know there’s always more work to be done, and, along with involved Ontarians, our government is doing just that. In March of this year, the Premier and I launched It’s Never Okay: An Action Plan to Stop Sexual Violence and Harassment. This plan will help change attitudes and behaviours, improve supports for survivors who come forward about abuse and strengthen legislation to make workplaces and campuses safer and more responsive to complaints about these crimes.", "You may have seen the thought-provoking TV advertisement that was part of the multimedia, multilingual public education campaign to support the action plan. That ad has been very successful and now has well over two million views on YouTube. More than 83.5 million people have viewed the broader ad campaign centred around the Twitter hashtag #WhoWillYouHelp.", "We’re also taking action to close the gender wage gap and to ensure that women are paid fairly for the work they do. Closing the gender wage gap will help women in Ontario to achieve their full potential in the labour market. When we are all treated equitably, we all benefit. Voilà pourquoi la Direction générale de la condition féminine de l’Ontario a déjà mis en place un certain nombre de programmes pour aider les femmes à faible revenu. For example, since 2003, more than 2,350 women have received training through our Women in Skilled Trades and Information Technology Training Program. This program gives low-income women the training they need to get better-paying jobs. We’re proud to have invested more than $2.1 million in this program last year alone.", "We know that closing the wage gap is important for Ontario’s economic prosperity, for women workers and their families, so we need to continue working on this issue. Last week, my colleague the Minister of Labour announced that our gender wage gap steering committee would be holding a series of consultations across the province this fall, and I will continue to work closely with him in order to develop that wage gap strategy.", "Women’s History Month and all the other occasions we’ve been celebrating this month serve to highlight the struggles and the accomplishments of women and girls in this province and across our country. I’m proud to recognize Ontario’s strong record of encouraging and supporting women and girls in the workforce and their communities. We’re working to increase opportunity for women across the province and to make them safer, and I am committed to continuing our work towards achieving full gender equality." ],

This is a national campaign that strives to educate, engage and empower us to take seriously the importance of proper waste reduction practices. It is all about shrinking our individual carbon and environmental footprints, saving money in the long term and keeping our environment healthy.", "All of us know the basics of waste reduction: reduce, reuse and recycle. Here in Ontario, we have made great strides towards reducing the amount of waste we generate, especially through recycling.", "For example, as many will remember, almost 30 years ago, the member for St. Catharines introduced legislation to establish the Blue Box Program, which today is part of our everyday lives. We can proudly say that the Blue Box Program is available in an incredible 97% of all Ontario households. But while we have achieved great success through recycling, there is much more we need to accomplish. While recycling is extremely important, it’s not the end goal. We need to focus our efforts on reducing waste.", "Our real goal, ultimately, is a zero-waste system and a zero-waste society, where materials can be reintroduced into the economy after their use and can be used to produce other materials and useful products for Ontarians. As an example, a pop can made of recycled aluminum uses 95% less energy than making an aluminum can out of virgin materials—just think about that.", "We want products to be used, refreshed, refurbished and reintegrated into new products. That means promoting more durable goods that don’t end up as waste. It means developing products and designing them so that they are not tossed away at the end of their life.", "Existing diversion programs in Ontario have helped us avoid creating 2.2 million tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution. In other words, to reach that same equivalent, you would have to take 500,000 cars off the road to save that many emissions. Just think of how much more pollution we could avoid by expanding the range of waste materials that are covered by diversion programs and by doing more to reduce waste before it is generated.", "The simple truth is that Ontario is one of the highest per capita producers of waste and air pollutants. In fact, almost 12 million tonnes of waste are generated annually in Ontario. That’s nearly one tonne of waste per person, putting us amongst the highest in the world. For the last 10 years, we have steadily been sending three quarters of that waste to landfill.", "We can no longer afford to act like a throwaway society. What we use today cannot be discarded tomorrow. We need to think about the consequences of the garbage as it piles up. At this rate, by 2050 we could be generating 17 million tonnes of waste a year and will need 17 more landfills to handle the flood of garbage.", "Along with the growing mountain of waste, it is also important to consider the financial burden to taxpayers. While the province has worked to ease the burden through producer-funded diversion programs, these programs only cover a portion of the waste entering our system. Most waste management will continue to enter the municipal waste management system, which is funded by municipal taxpayers.", "I am happy to say that we are soon taking action to further reduce our growing amount of waste. We will be introducing legislation, Mr. Speaker, with the approval of this House, eventually, to start moving us to a circular economy to improve natural capital productivity, to move to extended producer responsibility so the businesses that can actually reuse the material have final responsibility for its end use. This will be a very significant shift in our approach philosophically, and substantively, to a more market-based approach.", "It will have benefits for taxpayers. We estimate that our proposed legislation will shift the cost of recycling to producers, saving municipalities and municipal taxpayers over $115 million annually.", "With producers paying to manage waste, residents of Ontario can look forward to more convenient recycling options without additional costs, and to materials that could be valuably used in the production and manufacturing sectors of our economy being repurposed to useful inputs into our economy, rather than ending up as waste and in landfills.", "We believe that, working with members opposite—and all parties in this House have a long-standing commitment to the environment and waste reduction. We think this is an issue that we should be able to work together on. I look forward to working with members on this side of the House and the opposite side of the House to make this vision a reality." ],

Without their great contributions to society, women would not be able to become the innovators, the lawmakers, or whatever career that they choose today.", "Over the years, women have broken through many barriers and pushed through the glass ceiling to become leaders in every part of our society. I have a story from my riding of Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock about aviation. Lindsay is home to an extraordinary pioneer called Molly Reilly, who was born in 1922 and was the first woman in Canada to be a charter pilot captain and a corporate pilot. She is also a member of the Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame—a true pioneer of her time. Women’s History Month aims at honouring women such as Molly.", "Much has changed for women in Ontario since 1922.

They don’t want to be left at the sidelines; they want to be engaged and active participants in finding solutions for waste reduction. The same could be said for so many other waste reduction stakeholders.", "I have to give a nod to the Canadian Beverage Association as well, who have some very innovative ways that they would like to bring forward in Ontario to indeed achieve that circular economy that we heard the minister speak of earlier.", "Ontario, in my mind, has stagnated in taking advantage of the economic benefits to developing a cost-effective waste reduction strategy. According to the Ontario Waste Management Association, the result has been the export of more than four million tonnes of industrial and commercial waste to the US for processing. That doesn’t even account for the tonnes of waste we send to foreign markets outside of North America. This represents a significant loss of resources and economic opportunities for people right here in Ontario. Not only do we lose the financial value of the materials exported, but we also lose the innovation, the business opportunities and the job growth associated with recycling and reintegrating recovered resources into new products that are returned to the market.", "We can do better and we must do better, Speaker. With Ontario’s credit rating having been downgraded, our debt skyrocketing and our unemployment rates some of the highest in Canada, we cannot afford to let these economic growth opportunities continue to leave this province.", "This is where industry can help. While many questioned the compatibility of environment and business, the truth is, private industry has driven technological innovation that has allowed us to become more environmentally responsible.", "Speaker, let’s get back to the business of managing our waste, our economy and our environment. Let’s engage with the people on the ground, leading the way in innovation, and in doing so, make Ontario a leader once more in environmental policy and the economy." ],

The Famous Five who took the Persons Case to the Supreme Court blazed the trail that made it possible for 38 women MPPs to sit in this Legislature today, including, I am proud to say, the 11 women who make up the majority of the Ontario NDP caucus.", "Women’s History Month gives us an important opportunity to highlight and celebrate the contributions of Canadian women. This is a valuable initiative and well worth celebrating. But it can’t just be a one-off. It can’t be an annual pat on the back about how far we’ve come. Instead, let’s look at Women’s History Month as a call to action about how much more needs to be done if women are to achieve full social and economic equality in this province on issues like violence against women, the gender pay gap, affordable housing, precarious work and access to quality, affordable child care.", "Let’s look at Women’s History Month as an exhortation to apply a gender lens to every bill we debate in this House and to consider the impact of legislation on the reality of women’s lived experiences and the intersection of gender with race, class, disability, age, sexual orientation and much more.", "Let’s look at it as an opportunity to honour not just the Famous Five but the women who are quietly making history every day, the women who are leading efforts to make our province more just, more equal, more participatory, and the sisters in the labour movement who first led the fight for maternity leave, pay equity, labour law reform, child care, access to abortion, domestic violence laws and LGBTQ equality rights.", "Finally, let’s look at Women’s History Month as an opportunity to reflect on how much we have collectively benefited from the struggles and achievements of the women who went before us in their quest to build for all of us a future free of discrimination, violence and poverty." ],

In 2010, the Environmental Commissioner reported on Waste Diversion Ontario. The most recent records he had were for 2008. He said that effectively the overall waste diversion rate in 2008 was only about 23%, well below the 60% target that had been set. In 2013, the Environmental Registry: The government put forward its plan for a new waste diversion act and, at the time, said that only 25% of our waste was being diverted from landfill. That was 2013. We move up to today’s hit on the alarm clock and we find that we’re still in the same situation.", "From 2003 to 2015, the actions we’ve needed on waste diversion have not happened.

Mr. Bradley from St. Catharines made very eloquent speeches on this. Others, even before him, made really great speeches. I guess the question, Speaker, is whether Glen Murray will do better than Bill Murray so that when we wake up in October next year, we actually will have a waste diversion act in place that will make a difference.

For 45 years, she was a “blue coat” at the Royal Victoria hospital. I keep her volunteer appreciation certificate behind my desk here at Queen’s Park as a reminder of the importance that health and hospitals are to a community, and that service. That’s why I’m so alarmed by the diminishments in health care that we’re seeing here in Ontario today, and I think why so many people in Ontario are alarmed—they’re disappointed with these short-sighted decisions.", "Ontarians deserve a government that understands investing in front-line health care workers is important, and one that makes patient-centred care a priority. Instead, the Liberals cut health care spending by $54 million in the 2015 budget.", "Everywhere we go in the province, we continue to hear stories; story after story about how health care has been diminished, and whether it was meeting with doctors in Ottawa, whether it was meeting with doctors in Windsor, London or Orillia, everyone is concerned.", "The government cut physiotherapy services for seniors by $50 million and cut another $235 million from physician services. I say “another” because this is in addition to the $580-million cut in the deal imposed on the doctors earlier in the year after negotiations broke down between the government and the Ontario Medical Association.", "This government’s refusal to work with our doctors will only exacerbate the problems we face. The physicians’ perspective is critical to the modernization of the fragmented and failing health care system. With this government as their partner, more and more doctors leave for other jurisdictions or pass on setting up a practice in Ontario in the first place due to the hostile climate this government created.", "Earlier today, we heard a resident representative on OMA talk about the fact that they did a survey of residents in Ontario, and the difference between today and a few years ago is astonishing—the amount of residents who are saying that they’re now considering leaving Ontario, in all corners of the province.", "The Liberals’ decision to cut residency positions is also ill-researched and short-sighted. You may not notice it today, but it’s going to have a lasting effect on the province of Ontario. There are currently 241 communities in Ontario which the government itself has designated as high physician need. Some 800,000 Ontarians can’t find a family physician, and each year 140,000 more people enter Ontario’s health care system.", "Seniors can’t access home care services or secure long-term-care beds. What are the government’s priorities? How are they allowing this diminishment of health care to take place in every corner of the province? It certainly does not appear to be health care. It’s clear these decisions are all about money for the Liberals, and these cuts are being made at the expense of health of Ontarians.", "Blaming the federal government doesn’t wash with the facts. Federal contributions to Ontario health spending have continued, with 6% increases since 2004, through the Canada Health Transfer. So quite frankly, there’s no one else to blame for the failing health care system here in Ontario than this Liberal government.", "Let’s speak about the pure facts. In 2015, it’s the fourth consecutive year that base spending has been frozen for Ontario’s 155 hospitals. Ontario funds its hospitals at the lowest rate per capita of any province in the country, and one in four has experienced significant cuts or is facing closure. Visit any hospital, talk to the doctors, talk to the front-line workers, and they’ll talk about the huge challenges they are seeing on the front lines of the health care system, but the government is blind to it, or ignoring it intentionally.", "This government has handed out—now, let’s get this right—1,800 pink slips to nurses since they came to power. As this government continues to erode our health care system by slashing front-line health care services, we see what it is. The government has made it very clear what their priorities are, and it’s not health care. We see a government trying to sweep up the mess they made.", "Getting one’s economic house in order is a good thing. It allows more resources to be directed towards things that matter to people.

We have a deficit and debt because they have taken a province that was the most prosperous in Canada and caused us to lose 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Don’t blame doctors; don’t blame nurses; don’t cut physiotherapy from seniors; don’t do a full frontal assault on health care in Ontario. It’s patients that are paying the price for this government. It’s patients that are paying the price for this governance in Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, I am imploring the government to rethink these short-sighted decisions, to do the right thing, to support the motion put forward today, and understand that in every corner of this province, we value health care. Just like my grandmother did for 45 years when she volunteered at RVH as a blue coat, we treasure health care in Ontario. We treasure strong hospitals.

They refuse to admit that by their actions, they are creating chaos in our health care system; that by their actions, by refusing to realize that there is a human element to this—when you refuse to negotiate, when you impose unilateral agreements, you have to take into account the human factor of what you are doing now.", "You are being disrespectful to every single physician in this province. When our Minister of Health gets up on his feet day after day after day and puts down and demonizes and disrespects our physicians day after day, what do you think that does? It sends this message throughout Ontario that our physicians are a bunch of greedy people who put money at the front, and care at the back. This is wrong, Speaker. Those people are here because they want care to be at the front and this is the priority of our health care system. This is the priority of physicians in Ontario. They chose to be physicians because they wanted to help people. In order to help people, we have to be cognizant of the huge responsibility that they have and that in order for them to do this, they need to be compensated.", "I don’t get it. I don’t get it that we have a Minister of Health, who is a physician himself—we had the Premier on her feet this morning—who is willing to talk about anything except what those people are saying.", "What the physicians in the galleries are saying is, “Listen to our story. Listen to the message that the Liberal government is sending to the people of Ontario.” It’s a message that is so disrespectful that they had to come here to talk to you. They had to come here to show you that they are people who want to do what they know best. They are physicians who want to look after us. They are physicians who want the best care possible in the best possible health care system in Ontario. The least we could do is to treat them with respect, but we can’t even have that. When day after day the Premier and the Minister of Health stand on their feet and put them down, it serves no good.", "You see, for health to take place between the physician and the client or any other health care providers, there is this relationship of trust. You need to trust the person in front of you. They will often ask you to do things that intuitively don’t seem like that much fun to do. This is their job: to convince us to look after our health, to take our medicine, to do what they prescribe in order to get better. In order to do this, you have to have this relationship of trust. You have to be sure that the person in front of you who is talking to you has your best interests at heart, that this person wants to look after you, wants to care for you. This is what physicians do, day in and day out. But when we send those messages, to anybody who will listen, that are disrespectful, then you have a direct impact on their ability to provide care. You have a direct impact on the quality of care that they can provide to the people of Ontario.", "You—as in the Premier and the Minister of Health—are in a position of power. When you speak, people listen. When day after day you stand up and you keep saying that it’s all about the money, this message is heard loud and clear by the people of Ontario. This message is damaging to our health care system. This message is damaging to the care relationship that needs to take place, and it needs to change.", "They’ve come here today to tell you that they are more than willing to sit down and negotiate an agreement. Don’t get me wrong, Speaker. I’ve been at this game long enough to know that in a negotiated agreement, nobody will be happy with it. Nobody is going to get everything that they wanted to get, but they will be willing to live with it, because a fair and respectful process will have taken place that gives them an opportunity to be heard, that gives the government an opportunity to be heard, and then you find a compromise. As I said, nobody’s going to get everything they want, but they will be willing to live with it, because the process in itself is a process that leads to taking into account the human side of every negotiation. And this is what the government is missing completely.", "So what have we got? We were in a constituency week last week. I guarantee you that most of us got a phone call from a local physician. I can tell you I did. On Wednesday night, I joined the Sudbury and District Medical Society for a talk, really, where we went around the room and they told us how down they felt. They told me how disrespected they felt by the whole process and how this was having an impact on the kind of work that they were able to do.", "It’s hard to motivate yourself, day after day, often to be the bearer of bad news. Being a physician means that you are the messenger who tells people all the bad news. You are the messengers who tell them that, “You know those tests that I sent you for? Well, they came back, and you have a serious disease. You have cancer or COPD or you’re diabetic”—all of that bad news is delivered by those good people because it is their job to do this.", "To motivate yourself to do this day in and day out—that’s what they’ve chosen to do because they want to help people, but when your government keeps sending out a message that puts you down, it makes this really hard. I don’t know why we need to make things that hard. I don’t know why we don’t learn from one time to the next that it doesn’t matter if you’re a physician, a nurse or a teacher; you need to be treated with respect. You cannot have a Premier and a minister who stand in the House and put you down as a profession, as a group and as an association. It is so wrong.", "We have this group of physicians that have come down. Physicians don’t have very many ways to speak up. Let’s make no bones about it: They all know that they are the 1%. They know that they are well paid. They all know that, apparently, they are the best-paid physicians in Canada—that’s all that our Minister of Health is able to say in this situation. They know that, but nobody takes away the fact that they do important work. They deserve to be paid, just like you and I deserve to be paid, just like nurses and miners and everybody else deserve to be paid.", "The reason they came here is because they want to be heard. They want to negotiate. They want to have an opportunity to have their side of the story heard. But since January of this year, there has been no talk. There has been a government with their big boots that says, “This is the way it’s going to be. This is the way we are going to impose our view of the world on you.” If we have a little peek at what the view of the world of the Liberal government is, it is something completely bizarre where physicians get to work, and every once in a while—three months—they will look at how much money we have paid through the OHIP schedule of benefits, and if that amount is over a certain amount that the government has decided, all of their pay gets retroactively cut back.", "This is pretty weird because, on October 1, we had an overall cut of—I think it was 1.58%; I forgot the number that was announced on October 1. You have to realize that most physicians run small businesses. When you run a small business, you need to be able to look at what will be the revenues, what will be the expenses, and you plan for your business. Right now, Speaker, every couple of months, the rules keep changing.", "It’s pretty hard for a new grad coming out of school, with debts coming out of everywhere, to set up a new practice when you don’t know how much you’re going to be paid, you don’t know when the next cut is going to come and you don’t know when the next change to the way you’re being reimbursed is going to come. Not to mention that we spent a lot of time, effort and energy to train new family physicians to work in interdisciplinary care, to work in community practices where they would work as part of a team, either in a community health centre, an aboriginal health access centre or community family health teams. And now that they have been trained to work—lots of physicians, primary care physicians, are happy to have their residency done in primary care so that they can be a primary care family physician. And now they discover that they cannot join a family health team anymore, they cannot join a family health organization, that they will have to bill OHIP.", "We spent all of that training telling them to be ready to practise in an interdisciplinary care model, where you get a capitation and here’s how things are going to work. And once they graduate, we tell them that, “Oh, no, only a few of you a month will be allowed to practise that way. The rest of you will have to bill OHIP,” which is not what they had been trained to do and what they wanted to do and what they had planned on doing, for reasons that have not been explained.", "My area—all of the northeast is designated as an underserviced area, but I still have many of the new grads coming out of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine that want to practise in a team-based model and that are not allowed. They have to bill OHIP. They have to be fee-for-service, independent physicians. That’s not what we want. We want them to be part of a team. We want them to come and work in an interdisciplinary fashion, but they’re not allowed.", "I must leave time on the clock for my colleagues that also have lots to say. I’ll use my last few minutes to talk about the cuts to the number of residency places.", "For a long, long time, we have had difficulties recruiting physicians where I come from in northeastern Ontario. With the Northern Ontario School of Medicine, things are better. Things are looking up. We are able to recruit more. I’m thankful for this, and I say thank you for putting this program in place. It is very, very worthwhile and very good.", "But then this summer, we heard that 50 residency places were going to be cut. That’s always very worrisome for any one of us who comes from an underserviced area. Because, sure, the teaching is important—and I’m thankful that we have the Northern Ontario School of Medicine in Sudbury and Thunder Bay—but what is even more important is their residency placement.", "If we can get a physician to come and do a residency placement in a community in the north, this is our biggest tool for recruitment. Once they’ve had the opportunity to practise, once they know the referral patterns, once they know how the rest of the health care system works in the community—in the north or rural—they feel competent and confident in offering care to the people who live there, and this is very important.", "In the cuts that the Conservatives have talked about, they’ve talked about the 50 residency placements that have been taken away. This is worrisome. We need those residencies to be there. We need residencies to be there so that physicians get comfortable with where they work and they set up practice, hopefully family practices, in northern Ontario.", "So I will leave time on the clock. I want people to realize that when dozens and dozens of physicians come to talk to us, we owe it to them to listen to them, and we owe it to be respectful of what they’re here for." ],

We are getting better value for that money, and I think that’s our job.", "It goes on to project what some of these changes might be.", "I can tell you, Speaker, that our health care system is stronger now than it has been in a very long time; far stronger than it was when we took office 12 years ago. The improvements to our health care system—I’m not saying for one minute that this job is done; it is far from done, but it is a far, far stronger system now than it was 12 years ago.", "Let’s talk about transfers from the federal government. The Leader of the Opposition will be interested to read this transcript, because I’m sure he will want to correct his record. The cuts imposed by the federal government by then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper, supported by the Leader of the Opposition, are shortchanging Ontarians by $8 billion in health care funding by 2023.", "The Leader of the Opposition endorsed cuts to health care in Ontario when he was sitting in Ottawa. It’s interesting that he has now changed his tune. Those are real cuts, Speaker. Those are real dollars. Now he’s saying that this year $54 million from the Canada Health Transfer will be funneled away from health care for Ontarians. It is absolutely inaccurate to make that claim. Every single dollar we receive from the Canada Health Transfer goes to health care in Ontario.", "I have a copy of public accounts here, and I would happily pass this over—maybe the critic will take this. What you’ll see, if you actually read this, is that on page 82 of public accounts, the Canada Health Transfer did increase. It increased by $468 million. We are grateful for that increase. We wish it would continue to increase at that rate, but it has been slashed. We’ll see what the new government does. So we did receive an additional $468 million.", "Then, if you look on page 88, you’ll see that our health spending increased by over a billion dollars, a $1.104-billion increase. So to claim that we did not put every penny of the increase in the Canada Health Transfer into the health care budget is absolutely inaccurate. I’m sure that when he gets the chance, the critic will want to correct the record on that, Speaker.", "As I said, Ontarians deserve to have the best health care system. They also deserve to have the facts. When people in this place play politics with the truth, I have a real problem with that. I think we should all agree on what the facts are. They’re published in public accounts. I think it’s irresponsible and simply wrong for opposition parties to make up numbers that simply are not accurate. So I look forward to that.", "The motion goes on to say that we’ve cut $815 million from physician services. That is absolutely inaccurate. It is simply untrue. We are increasing compensation to physicians by 1.25% this year and next year. We’re continuing to increase the overall line for payments to physicians.", "We heard from the critic of the third party about the relationship between government and doctors. I can tell you, there’s nothing more troubling to me in all of this discussion than that relationship. I have met with many, many doctors in my riding. I have spoken to many, many over the phone. You know what? When you take the time to talk to physicians—and I’m sure the physicians in the gallery today would agree—we actually could get better value for the money that we spend in health care generally and in that physician services line.", "So we’re increasing compensation to physicians as the budget’s going up by 1.25%. There are more people to care for; we’re adding 700 more doctors each and every year—I understand that. But we tried very, very hard to work with the OMA through over a year of negotiations to actually come to an understanding of what changes we could make so that we could have a sustainable health care system that delivered the health care that people need to rely on.", "We actually had 75 different proposals that we tabled during those negotiations with the OMA to say, “What about this? What about this? What about this?” We wanted to work collaboratively with the OMA. Not only did they not respond to any of our 75 ideas of how to get better value for those monies so we wouldn’t need to do a rollback; they brought a grand total of zero new ideas to the table.", "So when doctors say that they want to work with government to make our health care system stronger and more sustainable, that is a two-way street. We need doctors to actually participate in the strengthening of our health care system. Every single meeting that I have had with a physician in my office in London—every single meeting—physicians have ideas on how we can do better with the money that we have.", "The reality, Speaker, is that we have a finite amount of money to spend on health care. Every additional dollar that we spend increasing compensation for physicians is a dollar we cannot spend on the other issues that matter to people. Our doctors are well paid; they should be well paid. They work very hard. They’re very highly trained. We are enormously proud of the work they do, but our precious dollars need to go where they’re going to make a real difference for people. When we spend more on one part of the system, it means, by definition, we have to spend less in another part of our system. There is no magic pot of money. We have to be very careful about how we support the health care transformation that is under way. If we want more people getting home care in a more timely way, we have to find that money somewhere.", "I’ve asked doctors, I’ve said, “Give me the top 10 things you think our health care system needs to deliver better care.” Doctors have really good ideas on what we need to spend more on. Not once has physician compensation been on the top-10 list of investments they think we should make. Doctors know—and it disturbs me a lot that doctors are getting distorted information from the OMA about what is happening here—that we are determined to make a measurable improvement in our health care system so that people get the care they need when they need it.", "There is significant transformation under way in our health care system—as there should be. We are really working to deliver the right care at the right place at the right time. We are taking people from hospitals and finding them places to live in the community.", "I heard about a young man not far from where I live in London who had been in an intensive care unit for 16 months because he needed mechanical ventilation. Now he’s living in a group home. Can you imagine living in an intensive care unit? Can you imagine having your food, your visitors—the lights on all the time for 16 months? We are now starting to move people into a much better place for them.", "One of the foundations of the transformation that’s under way is that if people need to be in the hospital, we need them to be in the hospital getting the best possible care. But if they can be cared for in the community, outside of the hospital, then we need to make those investments to get people out of the hospital and into their own home.", "We are working very hard to make the changes in our health care system so that it is sustainable. The reality is, we have a marvellous health care system, but we have to make changes if we actually want to deliver the best possible care. So we do have priorities. Everyone here knows that we are running a significant deficit in this province. We are working very hard to reach balance or are committed to doing that by 2017-18. We’re doing that because we want to be able to invest in the services that matter to people.", "So we have had to look very hard at our health care spending, but the suggestion that we’re firing nurses is simply wrong. We have 24,000 more nurses working in Ontario now than we did a decade ago—24,000 more. Are they all in hospital? No. They’re in the community. They’re delivering service where people want to be, and that is in their own home.", "We heard quite a sad story about the process by which we arrived at physician compensation. When I was Minister of Health in 2012, we had a very difficult negotiation. In the end, though, we did come together, and we set in place a process to resolve if we arrived at an impasse in the future, because neither the OMA nor the government ever wanted to go through that again.", "So we worked hard. We put in a plan that was agreed upon by the OMA and by the government. It was a signed agreement. The process was this: First, we tried to negotiate ourselves; we tried to reach that agreement. If that failed, we would bring in a third party, agreed to by both sides, to actually look at what was going on and provide advice on what the way forward was.", "This time around, we had to do that. David Naylor came in and wrote a report. We went back to the table following that. We were, again, unable to reach an agreement after that, so there was another third party that came in: Justice Winkler. In this case, Justice Winkler—that report was made public. I hope people have read that report because it does outline a number of excellent—he gives a lot of excellent advice that we are trying to implement, but he did say to the OMA, “Please accept this deal because it’s a good deal.” He said to the government, “Do not change your final offer.” Justice Winkler said, “Government, don’t change your offer; OMA, accept your offer, but you’ve got a lot of work to do, and you’ll only be able to do that work if you work together.” That’s exactly what we’ve done.", "So the notion that this was an agreement imposed—I think we heard “the big boots from the government.” That is not at all what happened. Justice Winkler gave us that advice.", "Interjection." ],

Two weeks ago, this government spent the time vilifying the doctors of this province. That tack is not working because doctors have banded together and patients are starting to see their services cut. Today, they’ve taken a new tack: “Let’s vilify OMA and try to divide the doctors.” I hope the doctors today will note that this government will try to take apart the OMA so they can take total control of the health care system. I’m hoping that they stick with OMA and don’t listen to the propaganda being put forth by this government.", "Health care is a provincial government’s most important responsibility. Our health, and the health of our families, is dependent upon timely access to quality care. This government, unfortunately, continues to erode the fragile system with cut after cut to health care.", "Let me put forward the truth about the cuts to the health care system. Maybe I can list a few truths here today that can be taken to the record. There was $54 million cut from the federal health transfer from the Canadian government; $815 million was cut from doctor services, although the government claims that that never occurred; and $50 million was cut from physiotherapy. They eliminated 50 medical resident positions, and thankfully, the government didn’t deny that. They agree: They cut the 50 resident positions. They’ve cut 800,000 nursing hours, and they’ve established this province with 800,000 people without a doctor.", "But to top it all off, this government said today in question period that they’re taking the money from the doctors to put into home care, to create more home care. However, the Auditor General stated in her report two weeks ago that 40% of that money goes to the bureaucracy. So what this government is doing is taking the money out of the funding envelope for doctors to provide services for health care and giving it to the bureaucrats throughout the CCAC system. It doesn’t reach the front-line health care professionals. It doesn’t reach the patients.", "The other thing that we’ve brought up during this debate is: Where has the money gone? Why? Why are they cutting health care? Why are there cuts coming to the front-line professionals? Why are there cuts and the freezing of budgets throughout the hospital system? We found out, Mr. Speaker, and perhaps I could shed some light on where some of this money has gone.", "They’ve spent $7 million on their consultants for the Hydro One sale. They’ve spent $4 million for a Hydro One CEO; $5.7 million to pay out the Pan Am executives; $6.5 million to pay consultants to sell Ontario, in which the province lost millions of dollars; $2 billion to implement the smart meters throughout this province; $2 billion on our eHealth system—a system in which they’re not even able to communicate with one another; and $1.1 billion on the gas plants.", "This is a government with four OPP investigations open and one charge already laid for somebody related to the Premier’s office. This a government that’s going to tell Ontario doctors that they’re all wrong, that the opposition parties are all wrong? They are a government under investigation from the Ontario Provincial Police. We can’t believe them, Mr. Speaker.", "Today, I’m focusing on the severity of the cuts this government has imposed on Ontario physicians—physicians who are critical to our health care system, the first touch point for any patient entering the system, the gatekeepers to access many other systems as they develop sickness. These cuts are short-sighted. We’re going to end up with longer wait times and reduced access to care for Ontario’s patients.", "Even before these cuts occurred, many communities throughout Ontario have had doctor shortages. Less than half of adults are able to see a doctor or primary care provider within two days when they are sick, and what the government doesn’t understand is that by cutting the $815 million that they say they’re not cutting, they’re punishing not only doctors, they’re punishing the patients throughout this province.", "The government’s decision to cut funding will lead to the loss of jobs for front-line health care services and force the closure of much-needed walk-in clinics and addiction clinics. Of note, we’ve already had three addiction clinics close in Toronto and we’re only at week three of the cuts.", "Just last week, Health Quality Ontario’s annual report highlighted the unfortunate reality that hospital readmission rates for patients with mental illness and addictions have not improved in five years, and suicide rates have not improved in a decade. Our cuts to doctor services are creating greater barriers for those with mental illness to access treatment and support services. We need to do better for our most vulnerable.", "These cuts may lead to the closure of walk-in clinics, resulting in patients who typically use walk-in clinics to misuse urgent emergency room services. That is a significant cost to the health care system.", "These unilateral cuts will further impact care in the future, as doctors retire or leave the province to work in other jurisdictions. This government’s refusal to work with our doctors is only worsening the issue. The doctor perspective is critical to the modernization of our fragmented and failing health care system. They must work with the experts in the sector to find solutions, not take the time to vilify them and impose contracts upon them.", "How will these effects affect our patients? We will see it in orthopaedic surgery. There have been many doctors I’ve talked to. We talked about one today. I was talking about the wait times and the fact that people are waiting two to three years for our cuts, and the fact that this government does not even come close to funding the necessity for orthopaedic surgery. In my riding alone, at the St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital, orthopaedic knee and hip replacements are ended 10 months into the year because there’s no more funding to maintain the year. I talked to the LHIN about it. The LHIN said our doctors are too efficient; they should stretch out their dollars for the whole 12 months. I’m saying, let’s utilize and get these patients through the surgery. Let’s get them better. Let’s get them active and walking again instead of making them wait longer and longer.", "Unfortunately, this government is not seeing what’s going on.", "In emergency rooms, there are not enough beds. Patients are ending up dying in the ER waiting for a bed. The doctors need to be there to focus on emergency cases. They can’t be preoccupied with refilling prescriptions because people don’t have access to a doctor.", "We need to ensure there’s investment in long-term care, of which this government has done zero in their whole decade and two years of being in government. They’ve neglected long-term care, which is causing our hospital beds to be filled with people who should be in long-term care, using up the money. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, this government still doesn’t get it.", "Earlier, I mentioned addiction and mental health and the number of clinics that have already closed. A study given to the government just a few years ago showed that $44,000 per addicted person per year is the cost to our system when they aren’t being treated. How are we going to rectify that cost being added to the system when this government is slashing services to those addicted throughout this province? It’s unfortunate that this government is going in that direction.", "I’d also like to talk about graduates, residents. Today we had Brenna Velker release her study. She’s a medical resident. She did a study throughout all the residents throughout Ontario, through a couple of groups. Not all of them responded, but she had a good number who quantified it. Before the government cuts, Ontario residents were surveyed—what is it that most likely they want to stay and work in Ontario. Some 90% said they want to stay. After the cuts: “How are you feeling? Do you think you’re going to want to stay in the province of Ontario after you’re done your residency?” Only 33% said they would stay. That’s a 60% change over the cost of what this government is doing.", "If they think that doctors are going to stay, if they think they’re going to deal with the shortage of doctors throughout this province, they have another thing coming. These doctors are going to leave, and this is after the government of Ontario put so much money into their education system.", "It is unbelievable that this government has taken the strong hand, the big boot, as the NDP have said, to this government. It’s unfortunate that they’re heading down this direction.", "What we need to do is find a way to ensure that we have sustainability in our health care system. This government is working year to year just to ensure their deficit doesn’t swell and bloat. They say they’ve increased physician services by 1.2%, but they know full well that the health care system naturally grows over 2% a year, so they’re underfunding the natural growth—the baby boomers entering the system, the 140,000 new patients who enter the system. They’re not even looking at—in case we have another SARS, a flu outbreak. How are they going to afford that? Is that going to be a further cut down to doctors?", "When the government comes forth and says they’ve set a budget—a cap like David Peterson did back when the Liberals were last in government—on doctor services, what’s going to happen when they reach that budget threshold? They won’t give a direct answer. They won’t give the doctors ongoing reports to say where they are with respect to the budget, so they can make modifications. They’re just going to show up one day with their cheque coming through from OHIP to pay for the services they delivered three months ago, and they’ll be clawed back, saying, “You’ve overbilled the province. We need to take the money back, because we’re too busy making scandals in this government. We’re too busy being under OPP investigations to ensure that health care is funded for the people of Ontario.”", "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker." ],

In my past, I had a very serious, life-threatening health condition, and without the great work of doctors, nurses and support staff, I wouldn’t be here right now.

You deserve to be treated better. You deserve to be treated with respect. From the bottom of my heart, from myself and my family, I say thank you very much to the doctors for what you do every day.", "The Liberal government’s short-sighted decisions on health care have caused chaos. The cuts have left 800,000 people without a family doctor, the cuts have left people in remote communities struggling to get the care they need, and the cuts have resulted in nurses and doctors leaving Ontario to find work elsewhere. I know that, on days, this government will willingly admit they made these cuts, but that doesn’t come very often. They spend that time blaming the federal government, the Conservatives over there. Well, I think it’s safe to say that we are going to see a lot less of that now. And it’s a good thing, because we all know that what is really causing these cuts is a government wasting millions of dollars to cover up scandals.", "Some of those scandals, like eHealth and Ornge, are related to our health care system, but more of them are not—the gas plant cover-up and the recent Sudbury by-election. This government has taken money out of our front-line services and used it to cover up. Instead of protecting the interests of Ontarians and making sure they have the health care they need, they have protected the interests of their party and made sure they have the votes they need.", "Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the Liberal Party. The cuts to health care have a serious impact in my own riding. Ten years ago, the town of Fort Erie was booming. Its population was growing, and its economy was growing. Thankfully, it still has one of the best tracks for horse racing anywhere in world. It had a fully functional hospital. The people of Fort Erie really liked having that hospital in town. It meant they didn’t have to drive 45 minutes down the highway to an emergency ward. It meant that babies made in Fort Erie could be delivered in Fort Erie. In fact, they liked their hospital so much that they had fundraisers and purchased equipment for the hospital. That’s right, folks: The people of Fort Erie used their own money to buy equipment for a hospital when their government wouldn’t.", "What do you think was the government’s response to it? Do you think they congratulated the people of Fort Erie? Do you think they realized their mistake and actually purchased the equipment that was needed for our doctors? Do you think they learned from this and made sure other hospitals had the funding they needed? I wish I could stand here today and tell you that they did all of those things, but I can’t.", "What I can tell you is that they closed the Douglas Memorial Hospital in Fort Erie. They closed the hospital and took the equipment to St. Catharines. Let me say that again. This government took the equipment that the people of Fort Erie paid for themselves with their own hard-earned money and shifted it 45 minutes down the highway to a new hospital in St. Catharines.", "As I’ve already said, that put people at risk. Fort Erie is a town that has been hit hard in the last 10 years, as manufacturers moved out of the province. It’s a town that needs to attract more people to increase its tax base, and now it’s a town that has no hospital. How is that going to help it grow?", "Simply put, from closing the hospitals to removing slots from Fort Erie Race Track, this government has put hardship after hardship on the backs of the people of Fort Erie. Rather than helping their community grow, the government has made it harder for them. It’s time this government started reversing their cuts and helping Fort Erie become the booming town that it was before.", "Let’s talk about Niagara Falls. I’ll tell a quick story about Niagara Falls because I only get so many minutes here. Some 14 million people go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon; it’s the honeymoon capital of the world. Guess what they do there? They make babies. That’s what they do: They go to Niagara Falls and they make babies. Guess what we can’t do in Niagara Falls? Because they took the maternity ward out of the hospital, we can’t deliver the babies. They have to go to St. Catharines. Does that make sense to anybody? Absolutely not. What does that do?", "Our health care cuts are hurting my riding. My riding has more seniors than just about anywhere else in the province. After all, we have, in my slightly biased opinion, the best place to retire in the province, not to mention the fabulous wines, the craft beer, the natural beauty, right in the heart of Niagara-on-the-Lake.", "However, having a large seniors’ population has its challenges, as well. Of course, the main challenge is that we need to be able to provide health care for seniors who live in Niagara Falls, Fort Erie, Niagara-on-the-Lake and everywhere in between. You shouldn’t have to drive 45 minutes to get to a hospital.", "Mr. Speaker, maybe you’re one of the lucky individuals who is still able to see a community nurse without having to go to the hospital. Well, unfortunately, for those nurses who have also been impacted by the Liberal government’s cuts to our health care system—and this is a story I think we should listen to; I want the doctors to listen because they can really relate to it. The nurses of OPSEU Local 289 have been on strike for six months now. This government decided to privatize the services that Local 289 provides in order the save a few bucks as part of their cuts.", "Now, the private company, owned by Linda Knight, that has taken over is paying these nurses a wage they can’t even make a living on. Now, think about this: Her company is bringing in nurses from across the province, putting them up in hotels, paying for their meals, all the while saying that they can’t afford to pay nurses properly. I encourage the health minister—and I wish he was here—to fix this injustice against the workers and the community and, quite frankly, the patients that are there.", "And you wonder—I know I got a few minutes left—why we have a crisis in health care? Let’s talk about why we have a crisis, why they’re looking at cutting—outside of some of the scandals that you have had. Let’s take a look at what we’ve done with the money, because I keep hearing how we put more and more money into health care. Well, it’s not true. The money is going to health care, but where is it going?", "Let’s talk about the LHINs. They put the LHINs together, so the money is going to the LHINs. What do the LHINs do? They have executives, they have CEOs; they have all these people. Then, what do they do with the LHINs? They make a decision to put an envelope together, and to give that envelope to CCACs which then have their own boards and their own workers. Again, taking the money—first it goes to the LHINs, then it goes to CCACs. So now what they do is, the CCAC, in my case in Niagara—guess what they decide to do? They contract the work out to a company called CarePartners which is a for-profit company that runs health care, and what do they do? They put those workers in and they pay them $15 an hour, and it’s actually closer to piecework for a nurse in the province of Ontario.", "Now, think about it. You guys know what I’m talking about.

Why did they do it? Because they’re getting the dollars to provide the service; they did it because they didn’t want them to have a collective agreement. It’s the first collective agreement. They wanted to break the union there. I think the Liberal government should be ashamed of themselves and what they are doing there.", "The nurses have said, “That’s not enough. We deserve to be able to live with our jobs. We deserve to be treated with the respect we have earned.” But that’s not what this government is doing. From our doctors to our nurses, to all others who work so hard to make our health care system great, this government has turned up their noses and said, “No. No, we won’t give you the funding you need. No, we won’t pay you a fair salary. And no, we don’t have the money.”", "I just explained to you that it’s not a money issue; it’s how you distribute the envelope.

As the President of the Treasury Board mentioned earlier, if one looks at our public accounts from last year and compares it to our budget 2015 projections, there is no $54-million gap that the opposition leader claims exists. In fact, there is more than $100 million in additional funding. So I don’t quite understand why the Leader of the Opposition continues to make this bizarre accusation. The math is, frankly, simple, and it is readily available.", "Mr. Speaker, this government has nothing but respect and admiration for Ontario’s doctors, for the incredibly hard work that they do, day in and day out, for the exceptional care that they provide for our sick and our vulnerable. They are the backbone of our health care system, and their role in making Ontario a world leader in high-quality and efficient health care is immeasurable. In fact, doctors are often the face of Ontario’s health care system, and I want to thank them for that.", "But I have to say that there is no full frontal assault on health care. If there was an assault, it happened when the party opposite reduced services in the obstetrics ward in my local hospital when my daughter was born. In fact, it happened, and my daughter had to be delivered at another hospital several miles away as a New Year’s baby. She was Milton’s New Year’s baby, but she was actually delivered in Oakville. In addition, if there was an assault on our health care system, it happened when that party opposite referred to our nurses as being obsolete, as obsolete as hula hoops. That is one of the most disrespectful things, I have to say, I’ve ever heard in my life being referred to when it comes to health care workers.", "Finally, when you talk about frontal assaults and assaults on our health care system, let’s talk about the dozens of hospitals that they closed. In my riding alone, the residents of Halton are able to now access three hospitals that are undergoing major renovations. The Oakville-Trafalgar hospital is now under way, almost completed, with more than $1 billion in investments in there. The Milton District Hospital has a $500-million renovation going on right now, and Joseph Brant Hospital has a major renovation going on. We are putting money into the health care system. It is making a difference when it comes to the quality of health care that is being delivered in this province.", "Now, there’s no question that Ontario’s doctors deserve to be fairly compensated for the work that they do. But it should be remembered that this is not your typical salary or wage discussion. Doctors bill for every service they provide, so, in effect, they can determine their salary, and our job is to set and manage the budget. We have increased payments to physicians by more than 60% over the last decade. As a result, the average doctor in Ontario is paid approximately $350,000 a year. Ontario’s doctors are among the best-paid in Canada. That is one of the reasons that the number of physicians in Ontario will grow by 13% by 2021, almost tripling the rate of Ontario’s—" ],

When the Liberals were first elected to govern in 2003, they immediately abandoned their election promises. As their first order of business, Dalton McGuinty and his Liberal government began privatizing health care services, quietly ushering in a two-tiered system. By 2004, access to eye vision tests and chiropractic and physiotherapy services were cut from OHIP coverage for most Ontarians under 65 years of age. I’m not certain when people under 65 stopped having all those concerns.", "But along with these health cuts, they also brought in a new health tax, the McGuinty Liberal Ontario health premium of up to $900 a month. I remember it vividly: “We will not raise taxes.” That was one that happened under their leadership and one of the first things they did. This was the highest tax increase in Ontario’s history and, yet again, another broken promise by a party that looked voters in the eyes and said, “We will not raise taxes one cent on Ontario families.” I’ll let the public wade in on that one and let us know whether they felt that was a tax and whether they actually did what they said.", "A decade later and under a new leader now, the Liberal government continues with that same attitude, which is short-term pitches just to get elected and then, after the election, going back on their word. Shortly after the new leader and now Premier was elected two years ago, the Liberal Party’s first order of business was to finish off the health cuts started by her predecessor.", "Under Kathleen Wynne’s leadership, the Liberals cut physiotherapy services for seniors by $50 million. They cut diabetic strips. They cut nearly a billion dollars from physician services. They cut medical residency positions throughout the province. They cut hospital beds—40 beds were just cut last month up north; 140 more hospital staff were cut in September at the North Bay Regional Health Centre. North Bay, Ottawa, Quinte region, London, Scarborough, Peterborough, Sault Ste.

They know whether people have been cut from their front-line health care or not, and we’ll let them be the judge.", "In my own backyard—I’ve spoken about this often in this House—the restorative care unit at Chesley hospital is in jeopardy by this government. Again, this will result in cuts somewhere along the line if they don’t provide funding for that. It’s a very entrepreneurial program. It’s a new pilot program, and it’s working very well to keep people out of hospital, from going back to emergency, which is exactly what this government tells us they want. They want more home care. They want people to stay in their home and get better care in their home. Yet, here is a program that’s working to transition them from the hospital to their home, and they continue to try to put the blame on either the LHIN or on the local hospital administration. I can tell you that the local hospital administration has done everything it can in its power to keep that program viable and keep it operating. It’s back on the shoulders of the health minister and/or their hatchet men, the LHIN, not the community.", "Clearly, gutting health care services is a core part of the Liberal Party’s business today. What is most galling is that this Premier is orchestrating health cutbacks while explicitly staking her integrity and her party’s reputation on that single promise to protect these same services. What is left when integrity is lost, I ask.", "Seniors suffering from disability or activity restriction need physiotherapy services to keep them in good health longer, improving mobility, independence and quality of life. Nursing and retirement homes are experiencing an increased number of falls and injuries among their residents. We’re talking 80,000 senior citizens who live in long-term-care homes. Most of those people who have those falls end up in hospital, our most costly form of health care. Again, why aren’t we being more preventive? Why aren’t we keeping people more mobile? Then they don’t have the same challenges that they’re experiencing.", "We should be taking measures to keep our aging population—these are our parents and our grandparents—healthy and out of hospital, rather than trying to rehabilitate them once they suffer an injury because they didn’t have the care and services up front. Nowhere are cuts to physiotherapy more detrimental than to seniors living in rural areas like mine, where access to clinics and doctors is extra challenging.", "Cuts to essential health care services are the result of the Liberals’ economic mismanagement. Patients are suffering because they cut their health care to make up for the billions they’ve wasted on scandals. Might I name Ornge and eHealth as just two big boondoggles? They cannot sit across the aisle and tell us they have not impacted the care of Ontarians. That’s money wasted that has done nothing for people’s health care, and I challenge them to actually come back and have a conversation about those.", "Their incompetence and excessive bureaucracy—yes, there’s a need for some administration, but it cannot be 40%, as was just reported in the Auditor General’s report.

It will grow from almost 2.1 million people today, or 15.2% of the population, to over 4.5 million, or 25.5%, by 2041. Yet this Liberal government has created a crisis in the system by continuing to ignore this critical contingent.", "After 12 years in power and countless reports on improving long-term-care standards in Ontario, the status quo remains and the long-term-care needs of our seniors continue to be unmet, this despite Liberal Party promises in every election since 2003 to bring in minimum care standards, build long-term-care beds and hire more staff to help residents with personal support.", "Despite setting up a whole new ministry, a new bureaucracy and going through multiple ministers and associate ministers solely responsible for ensuring that the needs of our seniors living in long-term care are looked after, there were 70,850 long-term-care beds when you formed government in 2003, and today there are only a few thousand more beds—76,000, to be exact—but there are 100,000 more seniors. You didn’t do your job.", "I don’t know how you justify spending billions on building new bureaucracies and hiring consultants to write report after report instead of building more beds and putting services in the front lines. You have over 21,000 seniors languishing on wait-lists. That means that in all of your 12 years in government, you managed to address only one in every five seniors in need of long-term care in Ontario. Shame on you.", "Also, your failure to enact minimum standards of care in long-term-care homes is putting the lives of frail senior citizens at risk. It’s important to note that 93% of long-term-care residents have two or more chronic illnesses, and more than 62% suffer from dementia. Ten years have passed since an inquest into two long-term-care deaths in Ontario made a specific recommendation to the government to bring in standards of care; namely, minimum hours of hands-on, direct patient care. Again, you have not done your job. The people of Ontario are suffering the consequences.", "The Rural Ontario Institute reports that there is a clear urban-rural divide when it comes to our health status. Rural residents are less healthy than their urban counterparts; constituents from rural areas have higher overall mortality rates and shorter life expectancy and are also at disadvantages for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In fact, the 10 sickest regions in Canada are located in rural and isolated areas of Quebec, Saskatchewan and Ontario. The Liberal government knows that the health of rural communities is suffering, and they know that better investments in public health would help toward achieving a healthier population. Yet instead of defusing the urban-rural divide and instead of enhancing our programs, they cut public health in Grey Bruce Health Unit’s budget, putting our constituents at an even greater disadvantage.", "How do you justify pulling the plug on rural Ontario and decreasing our health care funding, while increasing it for the urban areas? Where is the equity in your public health policy? This cut also means that small municipalities will be forced to pick up the slack, or if they can’t choose to do that or in fact do that, people’s health will again be put at risk. This is starting to look a lot like provincial downloading.", "Enough of the self-serving platitudes; someone on that side of the House needs to rise up and call a spade a spade and accept responsibility for your shortfalls. When it comes to living up to your responsibilities to protect Ontario’s frail senior citizens, you have collectively been nothing short of a very, very bad failure." ],

The nurses have come, the physiotherapists have come, the chiropractors have come and the dentists have come. This is an issue that affects every Ontarian, and I believe we have a moral responsibility to make sure that the money that is invested in the health care system is actually getting to the patients—to the citizens of this province—and I have evidence to prove that it’s actually not getting to them.", "The Deputy Premier was very fond of holding up the public accounts. Public accounts are an indication of the money that has been spent. It’s interesting, though, that she left out, on page 13 of the public accounts, that in fact the health care sector expenses were $42 million below plan, a lower spending in clinical education as well as some other programs. So there is a gap in this government saying that they are increasing the funding to health care, and then the public accounts indicating that what they are saying is actually not accurate.", "In fact, there’s a number of unbudgeted cuts that have come through post-budget as it relates to the public accounts, and they do come from health—as I mentioned, $42 million; education, $155 million; children’s and social services, $303 million; and post-secondary education and training, $167 million. This actually adds up to a total of $1.34 billion. So there is a good reason for us to question the numbers. I think, when you follow the money in this place, which, I have to admit, is not the easiest thing to do, it’s a bit of a shell game, especially when the Auditor General for this province does not have access to third-party contracted-out health care services, so she can only do her due diligence, if you will, to a certain point.", "It may be of interest to the people in the gallery and to the people watching that in the province of Ontario, right now, we are actually seeing an increase in the contracting out and privatization of health care. In Ontario’s health care system, 68% is publicly provided. We are at 31% of health care services that are provided by the private sector. This is a significant increase. In fact, no other province in the country is at this level. Canadians are spending now 37% more out of pocket on health care than they were in the 1990s, and as has been pointed out, 800,000 Ontarians do not have a family doctor. This is actually on the low end; it’s anywhere between 800,000 and one million people in the province of Ontario. And there is a cost. There’s a downstream cost to not having access to a doctor, because they actually assist people and direct people and patients to the systems of care that exist outside a family doctor’s office.", "So it’s really interesting to hear the Minister of Health, day after day, get up in this House and say, “We are not cutting.” Now the Deputy Premier has gotten up and said, “This is not true. We are not cutting.” Yet we have evidence of cuts based on what’s happening outside of this place. It may be shocking to people, but not everybody is focused on this Pink Palace. That’s why we’re really thankful when people actually come here. We need to pay more attention as to what is happening out in communities.", "I have a number of news articles, media accounts, that are documenting the cuts. Last year: “Guelph Hospital Bed Cuts Look Like Service Reduction....", "“This seems more like a budget-motivated service cut that will oblige a larger and more complex caseload for an already very busy local public health care-providing team.” In total, that was 15 beds.", "In Kitchener-Guelph hospitals: “Up to 22 recovery beds may disappear at hospitals in Kitchener and Guelph as health care funding shifts to home care and nursing homes.”", "Obviously, the focus is to get people out of hospital. Of course we support that. We want people, if they’re healthy, to leave a hospital, but they go to the community; they should be going home. But there’s still that population, obviously, Mr. Speaker, that requires in-patient support.", "In Cambridge: “Cambridge Hospital Laying Off 33 Nurses to ‘Improve the Patient Experience.’” Nobody will ever believe a headline like this, that if you cut nursing—if you cut front-line care—your patient experience is going to get any better. In fact, we know—and we have evidence to prove it—that that experience gets worse. The head nurse at the time was Brenda Pugh from the Ontario Nurses’ Association. She said, “Why are we diluting the skill set at the bedside?” If you dilute it, you weaken it. That’s just the truth of the matter.", "You heard the Deputy Premier sort of accuse the OMA of not coming to the table with creative options. If you listen to both sides of the argument, the cuts have already taken place. The system is already on a shoestring budget, and the side of the story that the Deputy Premier and the Minister of Health refuse to acknowledge is that doctors are operating offices and have expenses and overhead. They’re small employers, and they have clerks and they have administrative staff and they have overhead. And now they have wait-lists because people cannot get into these doctors’ offices.", "The Auditor General of this province has raised the red flag on where the money is going in the province of Ontario. I’m so thankful to have this document. For those of you who are watching, it’s important for you to know that the Auditor General is an independent officer of this Legislature. It is a non-partisan document. She has gone through the financial documents, including the public accounts, inasmuch as she can, to find out where the money is going with regard to CCACs. In the document that just came out in September of this year, they have concluded that the way in which CCACs operate and deliver services needs to be revisited. The reason why it needs to be revisited is that—and this is quite astounding to me—neither the ministry nor the CCACs and their association had analyzed how given amounts of spending on any given patient-care activities correlate with the patient outcomes that result. Such analysis would help CCACs prioritize their spending, allocating sufficient resources and funds to the most efficient patient-care activities.", "This is a $2.4-billion budget item which has become the catch-all for an already fragmented health care system. Instead of actually addressing some of the core issues that are facing our health care professionals, this government—this goes back five years—has never done a financial analysis of where the money is going, how the money is being spent, who is profiting from these investments.", "She does indicate, on page 14, that the costs that CCACs considered to be for direct patient care included items that did not involve direct interaction with patients, such as service providers’ overhead and profit. Somewhere along the lines in the province of Ontario, the profit margin for a third-party care operator became considered direct patient care. That is a broken system. That is why you have the funding pressures that you have right now in the health care sector.", "You also have those health care sector pressures because 25% of health care costs in Canada, and obviously in Ontario, are spent on treating patients in the last year of their life. The aging population—15% of Ontarians are 65 and over. This was a 2012 stat. It’s expected to increase dramatically over the next few decades.", "I’d like to just conclude with a story. This summer, the Globe and Mail did an exposé on where the money is going with regard to CCACs. They met a woman, Jennifer Sewell, who told her story about how she had a cyst removed from her body. She was sent home for home care, but she didn’t know that when she got home she had to actually drive to a clinic to get the wound serviced. That’s not home care. If you get sent home from a hospital and you have an open wound on your body, then someone should come and treat that wound. That’s why it’s called home care. Anyway, it was a terrible experience for her. She shared her story. This not a solitary story, Mr. Speaker, and that’s the most unfortunate part about this.", "It seems to me that this government is creating these mini crises all throughout the health care system and then relying on the private sector to answer the call. Well, the Minister of Health has a responsibility for patient care in this province. Doctors are a key part of that equation, and a unilateral collective agreement which has never been negotiated or agreed on is not going to work for the people of this province." ],

But sometimes in labour situations it’s hard for people to know exactly what it is and what’s going on.", "An old friend of mine once said to me, “Bill, always remember”—it was when I was first elected in 2003, early on—“health care is a political loser.” If you stop and you think about it for a little while, it doesn’t take long to figure out what he meant. It simply says that no matter how much you do as a government, no matter how much you invest, no matter how many nurses you hire or doctors you hire or nurse practitioner clinics you open or bring in new practice models like family health teams, no matter what you do or how high the budget goes, you will always find instances—because it’s like a $50-billion budget—where there will be pieces of it that people can pick at and create anxiety over within the health care professionals themselves and within the broader general public.", "That’s exactly what he meant. It’s easy to understand, and it’s true. If you go to an emergency room and you’re with your mother or your grandmother and you have to wait longer than half an hour, you’re going to get fired up and you’re going to think that the health care system is failing you. If you live in a community that doesn’t have enough doctors so that everybody has access to primary care, you’re going to think that the system is failing you—understood. But just because those situations exist, it does not mean that the system is failing; it just means there is more work to do. It doesn’t mean that as a government we haven’t enhanced the system from what existed when we came here in 2003.", "I think what I would say to our friends that are in the gallery today—and I welcome them and I thank them for being here—at the end of the day, when all is said and done, instead of worrying about this bit of money and that bit of money and that it’s hard for everybody to know, I would tell you to step back and just remember some larger numbers.

I heard somebody talking about it previously.", "In my community of Thunder Bay–Atikokan, when I was elected in 2003, there were 35,000, give or take, orphaned patients in my community—35,000—we know who was in government from 1995 to 2003; that was almost like one in four of the people who lived in my community. Today the number is 13,000. If you’re one of those 13,000 people, you’re still not going to be happy; I get that. I’m not satisfied yet. But look me in the eye and tell me that 20,000-plus people having access to primary care isn’t significant progress. You won’t hear anybody stand on this side of the aisle and say, “We’ve got it all right and we’ve made it perfect.” But, Speaker, my goodness, there has been tremendous progress, and I remind people again of the context in which these investments have occurred.", "I’ve got way here more that I want to say, but I can’t, because the Minister of Transportation is waiting. But I remind people of the context in which these investments have occurred. We went through the greatest recession since the Great Depression. The easy out for us was to fire nurses and not to hire doctors. Even though demand was growing, even though we had an aging population and an expanding population, it does not necessarily mean we automatically had to hire more doctors, but we did. And we made those investments when government revenues were severely challenged as a result of that recession.", "Speaker, I’m just trying to provide some context for some of the work that we’ve done. I wish I could use the last nine minutes, but I know my friend on the right is going to have some things to add to this as well. I thank you for your time." ],

They don’t feel valued, and I have to agree with them.", "If you go to school for an average of 11 years, post-secondary, and you have huge debt—and you didn’t just go to school; you were working for practically minimum wage, training in hospitals. You were very competitive in high school to get the marks to get into medical school, and everything that you’ve dedicated your life to—you care about your patients; you care about your staff; you care about your neighbourhood and your families. We know so many doctors who also volunteer in their communities. They’re community-minded people.", "But they also deserve our respect and the respect of their patients as well as the government and all the bureaucracies. When the doctors are being told, “More money is being put into health care, but we are cutting your service fees,” they are insulted. It’s plain and simple. They are insulted, because, yes, they understand that the population is aging. They understand that there are new treatments that are more expensive, that patients are living longer, that we can do more for our patients to keep them living longer with a better quality of life, but that it costs. They expect the government to plan for this.", "They don’t expect to see money wasted on eHealth when the government could have very easily gone to Alberta. I implemented the electronic health records in a medical clinic myself. I know it’s not easy; I know it’s expensive. But this government managed to spend close to $2 billion and not achieve its goal, when Alberta had already achieved the goals and the government could have easily gone to Alberta and saved all that money. The government didn’t have to move the gas plants and they could have saved the billions of dollars. The government didn’t have to give bonuses to Pan Am executives. The list goes on and on, Mr. Speaker.", "The reason the doctors came down today, the reason the doctors feel disrespected, is because they see money being spent on things outside health care, and inside health care, yet their fees are slashed. They are treated as government employees when it suits the government and as small business owners the rest of the time. Maybe the doctors made a mistake when they went into this model of medicare in that they didn’t insist on the government paying for their rent, and hiring and training their staff. They spend hours every week just doing paperwork, just paying bills, just dealing with landlords, training staff, and then staff come to them and—you know, we’ve all been through it where staff have health problems, they have family issues, perhaps a staff member is pregnant and it’s a technician who has to work a machine. It’s not easy to find somebody and to train somebody. Doctors often spend six months training a new staff person just to have that staff person say, “You know what, this job is too stressful. I’m going to work somewhere else.” They had to pay from their OHIP billings, their service fees, to train that staff person.", "Doctors are told—say they’re in some kind of family health team—if their patients go to see another doctor, their fees are cut. Why doesn’t this government consider implementing a system where if you don’t go to the doctor who is rostered to be your doctor, maybe you have to pay out of pocket? Maybe you have to pay for that second opinion. Maybe the government has to ‘fess up to the population and admit—admit—it doesn’t have the money for first-rate health care in the province of Ontario and this is the way they’ve decided to budget: They’ve decided to budget that everybody can see just so many doctors per year or they can only see a specialist once per year, and that patients are going to have to somehow get health insurance or somehow cover it out of their pocket.", "The government doesn’t want to do that, and that’s why it’s so insulting to hear the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry saying that somehow the opposition day motion is playing games and trying to score political points. The fact that the government has decided to try to balance their health care spending because they’ve hit a brick wall in terms of their spending capacity, that they’re trying to balance it by cutting and slashing doctors’ fees, is exactly because they are trying to politically solve the solution without upsetting patients. If they try to limit access to health care, well, that’s a lot of voters. That’s a big voting group.", "Doctors cannot go on strike and doctors wouldn’t. We know our doctors wouldn’t go on strike even if they had the right to strike. We are well aware of that. We are well aware that the doctors wouldn’t do some kind of work-to-rule the way we have seen with other public sector workers. They wouldn’t say to their patients, “No, I’m not giving you a renewal for your prescription. I’m not rewriting the prescription that you lost on the way home from your visit to doctor. You know, why don’t I send it to the Ministry of Health and have you get it from them?”", "Doctors don’t like having to say to patients, “You know, that’s not covered by OHIP and you’re going to have to pay.” Many doctors are capable of doing that; they’re capable of charging service fees to their patients for things that have already been shown to not be covered by OHIP services. They don’t like doing it. They don’t like nickel-and-diming their patients but they also want to be fairly compensated for the average of 11 years that they go to post-secondary education, for the years of training, for the nights of on-call, for the calls that they take that they’re not paid for—all the phone calls. Many patients have children who don’t speak to each other, so you speak to one child and the parent has Alzheimer’s and you explain whether they can handle having surgery or not, and then you have to speak to the other child.", "This is hours and hours every week that our doctors spend on the phone, spend in person, just trying to counsel, that they’re not compensated for. They’re not asking for more money, but they’re also not asking to see their fees slashed. It’s not just about the money—yes, they do have expenses to pay—in terms of the fees; it’s a kick in the head. That’s what’s upsetting them. That’s why they took time out of their busy lives.", "We saw some doctors came with their children today, which reminds us that they have children who want to go to hockey, like my colleague here. They want to take their kids to hockey. They want to see their kids in the school play. Well, it’s not easy to take time off when you have sick patients who have appointments, when you have emergencies, when you’re on call. We’ve heard doctors speak to us about getting ready to go home from the hospital after a long day and then seeing an emergency come in. Realising that there’s not enough staff to deal with so many emergencies at the same time, they decide to stay and help out. Those are the doctors who we want in this province, Mr. Speaker. Those are the doctors who the patients of the province deserve.", "I think that we’re put here as parliamentarians to ensure that the priority is health care, and the best health care. If too much money is going to bureaucracies, then we have to address that. We don’t necessarily need to always build more hospitals. Yes, some areas are underserviced in terms of hospitals, but perhaps with existing hospitals, we can have surgeries go on in the evenings or on the weekends. A lot of times, patients are misled by politicians in thinking that a new hospital in their area is going to mean more access to health care. Well, a new hospital needs doctors and nurses and equipment to run, and sometimes we’re better off putting more equipment, more doctors and more nurses into an existing hospital rather than just building new hospitals—unless we have put aside the money. Obviously, we’d prefer new hospitals, but we also have to have the money in place to have adequate health care professionals and equipment to run those hospitals.", "To wrap up for this side of the House today, I just want to mention very quickly that the Ontario population at 13.6 million, with 320,000 patients treated per day by our doctors, 5.9 million patient visits to emergency rooms every year, 59 million patient visits to family doctors, 57 million patient visits to specialists and 50 hours of work per week for most of the doctors and 22 hours a week on call—all I want to say from this side of the House is thank you, thank you, thank you. We couldn’t have the type of province where people all over the world—they don’t just want to come to Canada; they want to come to Ontario. One of the reasons is the fantastic health care system that we have." ],

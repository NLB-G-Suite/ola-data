I must say I was quite intrigued when this act first was proposed. I thought that there was an opportunity here because, as many members know, I sat on the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions. Speaker, I believe you were the Chair of that particular committee.", "A select committee is rather unique in its makeup in that every recommendation that comes forward is approved, endorsed and agreed upon by all three parties in the House. We did that with the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions. We, in fact, spent 18 months doing that. It was a long journey, as you can imagine, because with mental health issues it is not particularly easy for presenters to share their stories and explain how they have been treated or, in many cases, mistreated as a result of their mental health illness.", "I was very much looking forward to seeing what was in Bill 122. I have to say, I really believe there is a missed opportunity here. Bill 122—and I did go to the ministerial briefing, so I know from what I speak; this is not from reading some two-page bill summary—is very specifically related to fixing one issue. I get that. I understand it. When the court imposes deadlines and makes recommendations, as legislators we must react to that. I understand that. However, we are opening up the Mental Health Act, and there were some very specific recommendations from the all-party committee that I think we should have been bringing forward with Bill 122.", "Now, having said that, there is an opportunity for everyone to fix their mistakes, because when Bill 122 gets referred to committee, if we have unanimous consent, we can bring forward some of the amendments and some of the recommendations that are in this select committee report. I would urge government members who sit on whatever committee Bill 122 ultimately gets referred to, that they seriously consider that. Again, I’m going to spend most of my time referring to the recommendations, all-party supported, that were given as a result of the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions.", "There were a number of recommendations related to justice issues, courts and corrections. One of the things the select committee found out very quickly was that services for court mental health workers—these are some of the recommendations we brought forward and that I would like to see incorporated into Bill 122. Even though I understand this is to solve a very particular fix—I get it—we all understand that there are very few opportunities for us to add to and amend certain legislation. We have that opportunity with Bill 122 right now. I would hate to see after—this report is almost five years old—that we don’t take the opportunity to move forward.", "Specifically related to justice and the court system, the select committee recommended: “The services of court mental health workers should be made widely available across all regions of Ontario, in order to divert more individuals with a mental illness or addiction out of the justice system and into appropriate mental health and addictions services and supports.”", "If you go back to what is the nub of the issue with Bill 122, this recommendation works very well, because it’s all about incarcerated individuals who have mental illness and their access to service.", "The second recommendation: “Additional mental health, drug treatment, and youth mental health courts should be created across all regions of Ontario, to provide more appropriate services for individuals with a mental illness or addiction.”", "Again, Bill 122 is a result of a court order and a court issue related to an individual who is incarcerated, who is in an institution and isn’t getting the services they need. So this recommendation does fit very nicely with Bill 122.", "“The Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services should direct police forces across the province to provide training for officers who may encounter people suffering from mental illnesses and addictions.” I don’t think we have to look too far in the news to see the value of what that recommendation could and would do.", "Probably the most important recommendation that we keep coming back to with this select committee: “The core basket of mental health and addictions services should be available to the incarcerated population, and discharge plans for individuals with a mental illness or addiction should be expanded to include the services of a system navigator and appropriate community services.”", "I get that this comes because you have to do something. The court has imposed a deadline; I believe it’s December 23. But we have an opportunity, with those very specific four recommendations, that I believe would actually improve Bill 122 and that are a very appropriate match for what you are trying to accomplish.", "Instead of just opening up the legislation and fixing a very specific part of it because you were forced to through litigation, why don’t you actually look at the bigger picture and say, “We actually have some half-decent research that is a result of 18 months of study, 18 months of deputations from court officers, from people with lived experiences, from family members who were part of this discussion”? You could improve what you have already started with Bill 122. As I have said before, I truly believe this is a missed opportunity.", "Sometimes we forget that some of the hard work and some of the research have already been done, and I believe that has been done with this report. There are members of cabinet who were on this committee and who know very well what this could mean to the lives and families of individuals who have mental health illnesses. I urge the members of the committee that ultimately will be sitting and reviewing Bill 122, when it gets to committee, that they allow for unanimous consent so that we can go further than what a very limited Bill 122 is offering us right now today. I have no qualms with what is being suggested in Bill 122. I just think we could do a lot more when we have the opportunity and when the legislation is open, which is what is afforded to us right now. I will leave it at that." ],

I’ve got to tell you, having a family that was supportive and a system that was engaged with my sister allowed her to live safely through her entire bout of schizophrenia, which started at about age 20. Unfortunately, she died when she was 60 of breast cancer, but it wasn’t the schizophrenia that got her in the end.", "I have to say that it is so, so important that we, first of all, identify what the issues are with the individual so that we can try to at least marshal the types of support that that person needs in order to be able to survive. My sister, in the case of the Canadian Mental Health Association in Timmins, was very well supported by the workers there and by the ACT team, and where the family was not able to provide certain services, they were able to be there and help my sister through a lot of what she had to go through. She ended up living a very productive life. Louise lived on her own in her own apartment for the last five or six years of her life. She was able to manage things quite effectively. We had to put some supports around her in order to make sure she was able to function, but once that was in place, it worked fairly well. The CCAC came in and provided her some basic support that she needed in order to be able to function. The Canadian Mental Health Association was there, and myself, as the only living relative left in Timmins for the last five years of her life, was there, along with my wife and daughter, to assist where we could.", "The real point here is that it’s not just the system that has to respond; families also have to respond and be there for their loved ones." ],

There’s no family, I don’t think, in the province of Ontario that hasn’t been affected by someone whom we love who has been affected by a mental health issue or an addiction.", "That’s why we as a government, when we took office in 2003, saw it as a priority. Since that time, we’ve invested close to a total of a billion dollars now in mental health and addictions strategies and services. We plan to continue our investments and increase funding by $220 million over the next three years. That’s our commitment as a government in recognizing the impact that it does have on our communities and the economy of the province of Ontario.", "Due to our investments, there are more than 55,000 additional children and youth now receiving the care that they need. Also, we have invested over $11 million to place 144 mental health nurses in our schools. That’s important, Mr. Speaker, because it’s important that we provide those supports early on in one’s life to give them a good, fresh start in contributing to the great province of Ontario. We have more than 770 mental health workers serving in communities, schools and in court, and more than $2 million in funding supporting training and professional development for aboriginal mental health and addictions workers that serve our aboriginal youth and children. We’ve created 19 new specialized nurse practitioners specializing in eating disorders, who now help close to 500 children.", "There are many more that I could talk about, the investments we made, but I look forward to this getting to committee so that we can have some more debate." ],

To all members—it was an all-party committee, and I think they did great work.", "What I’ve really heard throughout this debate is how far we have come. That’s a great thing. There used to be a lot of stigma associated, and sadly, in some cases there still is, but we’ve come a long way, where people are willing to actually acknowledge that they are having some challenges. I think it’s equally important for other people to step up and be prepared to be there for other people.", "In my great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, we have a resource that, sadly, has come about as a result of a young man, Wes Cameron, taking his own life. His mother, Yolanda, and father, Jamie, have come out and established Wes for Youth Online. That’s a resource that, certainly, is wonderful in our own backyard, but with the advent, of course, of electronic technology, it’s available to anyone across the world that can actually utilize that.", "Keystone children services is wonderful, and the Canadian Mental Health Association, again, has great services. We’ve just had some more money made available so that we have 24/7 access, which is great, but I think we can’t stop there. We can’t rest, because I believe—and I believe my colleague, Mr. Yurek, from Elgin–Middlesex–London, phrased it in the way that mental health has to be treated the same as physical health problems. We put a lot of emphasis on physical health and the resources into it, but mental health is equally as challenging, in some cases, maybe more. I think we need to ensure that that has equal treatment.", "For this year’s World Mental Health Day, I think the theme really was focused on dignity in mental health and, again, ensuring that we have the resources and the services there for people when they need them.", "I would like to just reach out to everyone who’s either listening or watching at home—and all of us can play a role.

It only came here because the court forced us to deal with this. But there is such a pent-up demand to make changes to the Mental Health Act. You can see it by the broad views that are brought forward by the members of this House. Sadly, Speaker, we will be the only ones who will get to talk about mental health, and for a very limited amount of minutes will we be allowed to do this. Shame on all of us.", "The people out there are ready to talk about mental health. They are ready to effect change about mental health. They know that the bill that we have now, the Mental Health Act, does not serve us in 2015 anymore. It was the best we could do 20 years ago, but in 20 years, everything has changed: stigma, treatment, the way that we support people with mental illness. Everything has changed.", "Within this bill that is so, so narrow, there are some huge flaws. It cannot go through the way it is. Although it will meet, on paper, what the court has told us had to be done, on the ground, for the people who offer that care, the support is not there. The facilities have not been built. The clinical areas do not exist—a real shame. Those people deserve to have treatment. If they’re going to be held, on form, they should have access to treatment. This is not the case, not because of the law, but because of a lack of resources dedicated to mental illness." ],

We need to get that opportunity to add, to expand, to improve Bill 122 when it gets to committee.", "I spoke about four recommendations. There are actually another four that, again, directly relate to courts and the justice system. This is not a new issue. We were talking about this. We were bringing forward recommendations five years ago because we saw the challenges then. To fix one very specific, narrow part as a result of a court order and ignore the work that happened in the select committee I think is a terrible injustice to the people who presented, and, quite frankly, I think it’s a missed opportunity.

But as we all know, unless that particular section of an act is open, the government normally rules us out of order with our amendments.", "The plea that I’ve heard from many members here is to open up the entire act, regardless of the section that this particular bill deals with, and let’s have a fulsome discussion and debate and improve the Mental Health Act for all of those many hundreds of thousands of people who actually suffer with mental health issues in this province.", "If the Legislature fails to meet the December 23 deadline, the offending sections would become invalid, and that certainly would or could put public safety at risk for the 330 patients who are currently being held on an indefinite involuntary detention, if they are released. The member from Nickel Belt, when she did her one-hour lead on this issue, talked about many of these patients being the sickest of the sick. Some of them have been held for 20-plus years.", "I want to segue into nurses working in mental health facilities, nurses working in hospitals across our province. Just recently—I think it was last Sunday night or Saturday night—Marketplace actually did an exposé on violence in the workplace for nurses across this province. In a five-year period, I believe from 2008 to 2013, 800 nurses in the province of Ontario and 4,000 nurses across Canada have actually been injured in the workplace.", "I would hazard a guess that many of these nurses work in psychiatric facilities in our province. We know that there have been nurses murdered in mental health facilities in past years; there have been nurses severely beaten. The problem that came up, though, in this exposé was that although the nurses are reporting these injuries across the province of Ontario and across Canada, and there have been investigations done by the Ministry of Labour, only three charges have been laid in 700 reported incidents.", "Nurses are now hesitating to actually report: one, for fear of reprisal, perhaps from their hospitals or employers; and two, because nothing is getting done. How can 700 nurses file complaints with the Ministry of Labour about being assaulted, both verbally and physically, by patients, by families, and the Minister of Labour has only laid three charges? There is something unconscionable about that.", "I see a huge pattern here in Ontario and across Canada: Nursing health care is the fourth from the highest of the most dangerous occupations in relation to injuries here in the province of Ontario and across the country. There is something wrong with that because nursing is a caring profession. That’s what nurses do; that’s why nurses go into nursing training, to actually look after patients, and at the end of the day they should be able to go home without being injured in their workplace.", "I also wanted to talk, while I have the opportunity, about a psychiatrist who lived in my area for many years and was involved with doing forensic assessments, not only in long-term-care facilities in the province but in our federal prison systems as well. His name is Dr. Thoppil Abraham, and he is now retired back to India. He worked out of the Niagara Health System for many, many years. He was a great community activist. Even after he retired from the actual hospital system, he volunteered in our community and he volunteered in the Kitchener-Waterloo and London area as well to assist people who were living in poverty and had mental health issues to be able to acquire ODSP or CPP. He would go out to those communities as a volunteer. He didn’t need to do it. But he was so compassionate in his care to people living with mental health issues and all the injustices that they face that he in his retirement years did that. Eventually, about two years ago, he went back to India for a visit and decided that he would retire there.", "We are celebrating in my riding our 40th anniversary, and Dr. Abraham will be getting a lifetime achievement award from the NDP riding association in my riding at the end of this month. Unfortunately, he’s not going to be here to be able to accept it.", "It’s funny, we talk about the stigma of mental health. During my time working for the Ontario Nurses’ Association and representing nurses who sometimes would have their LTD denied or other benefits denied, I would often have to call upon Thoppil to assist me in providing some medical reports that would assist a nurse to actually get benefits from Great-West Life or Manulife. This is just a little story about that stigma. So I would arrive at his office to actually go and pick up a report. His waiting room would be bursting at the seams with patients waiting to see him, and they would be shocked to see me, because, of course, they knew me. I had been the mayor of their city; I had been a city councillor. It was like, “What’s she doing here?” On occasion a patient would say, “Cindy, what are you doing here?” I’d say, “Well, I’m here to see my psychiatrist, what do you think I’m doing here?” There still is this stigma about mental health.", "I also wanted to take the opportunity to speak about—the member from Nickel Belt, this morning, in her two-minute hit talked about it—the services that aren’t there. Some 40% of the inmates in our provincial jails actually have mental health issues. Many of them are there because of their mental health issue and ended up there when they were arrested at some point in time. There are no programs or services being administered to these inmates.", "In fact, when the RNAO was here last year and the year before doing their registered nurses’ lobby day with us—that Shelley Martel, the former member from Nickel Belt, actually assists them with—I had the opportunity to meet with some nurses who actually worked in our provincial corrections system. They said that it is very distressing for them that there are all of these inmates sitting in our provincial system—I’m sure some in our federal system as well—and they’re not receiving any care, any counselling, any psychotherapy at all, other than their short interaction with the registered nurses of whom there are few. I think it is one nurse to every 130 inmates in the system. You know, prisoners are supposed to be getting rehabilitation while they’re in our corrections system, but that isn’t happening. So that is problematic as well.", "I wanted to also talk about the closure of the psychiatric beds in the province. During that time that I was working for the Ontario Nurses’ Association, I was involved in some of those mergers and amalgamations. One that comes to mind was the merger of the Queen Street Mental Health Centre and the former Clarke Institute, which is now the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. At that point in time, I think the PCs were in government—correct me if I’m wrong—and a lot of the psychiatric beds across the province were systematically closed.", "Unfortunately, the appropriate supports weren’t put in place. So, even today, many of the homeless people that you see in urban areas, particularly, are people with mental health issues. It doesn’t matter whether you are living in a big city—although I think the supports may be better in urban areas than they certainly are in rural areas in the north or in smaller communities like Niagara—the supportive piece just isn’t in place. So many people with mental health issues exist on ODSP, or CPP, if they happened to have a period of working for 10 years in their life. So these are people who are living on $1,000 a month. They’re supposed to be able to get housing and eat and, somehow, get some psychiatric care.", "Now, I can tell you, in the Niagara region, for example, where the Liberal government, actually, has closed half of our hospitals and merged all of our psychiatric beds into one site, it’s very problematic for people. People who are living on the edge with mental health issues sometimes have burned out their families and their friends, so their only friends are their local community hospitals.", "I can tell you, having worked at the Welland hospital on and off for 20 years, that many of our psychiatric patients who would be released from the in-patient unit would hang out at the hospital, and we were their only supports and friends. We’d see them in the cafeteria when they would come in for, perhaps, a group session. We would see them at the snack bar, and we’d sit and talk to them. Today we have one psychiatric unit, at the St. Catharines site of the Niagara Health System. We do not have an adequate transportation system in-site in the Niagara region, so it’s very difficult for patients and their families to access the supports that they need.", "In my own building, it’s called an open-doors concept, at Canal View Homes. It’s a 70-unit apartment building over some commercial space. It’s where my constituency office is. There are 54 units dedicated to people with mental health situations. When it started out, when it was built 20 years ago, it was a supportive-housing model. They had two support workers in place Monday to Friday, and sometimes on the weekends if they were having special events. They would organize all kinds of—you know, Valentine’s parties, and they would take them out to various festivals that were going on in our community.", "But about three years ago, that funding support stopped. For $100,000, all of those activities for 54 tenants in my building stopped. There was one tenant, who still lives there—her name is Mary Jane Huneault, and I’ve talked about her before here in the Legislature—who cycled in and out of psychiatric units for most of her adult life. But for that 20-year period that there were two support workers in place—probably making about $40,000 a year each, with benefits—she never had one admission to the in-patient mental health unit.", "Since that supportive money has been removed, eight people have had to leave their units, because they could not function independently without those supports. A number of them have had admissions to the in-patient unit in St. Catharines, where they have no transportation to get them there or for their friends and families to come and meet them.", "This whole issue of mental health is not going away. It’s probably a much bigger issue than any physical illnesses that we can talk about. A number of members have talked about the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions that came up with 20-plus recommendations and the need to open up this Mental Health Act to get us there.", "I hope that the government is intently listening and that they’ll give all of the parties the opportunity to table amendments, regardless of whether that section of the bill is open or not. Let’s have a fulsome discussion at the committee level about that.", "We know that there are over 400 agencies for adult mental health issues, and I think 300-plus agencies for children and youth with mental health issues. The member from London–Fanshawe brought forward a bill—I can’t remember the number of the bill, a private member’s bill—about a month ago, or two months ago. It talked about the government developing oversight for mental health issues, so that we make sure that all of our resources are being used in the best way and that people in Welland, Nickel Belt, the rural areas of the member from Timmins–James Bay’s riding and in aboriginal communities all have the same access to mental health services, and that people in Toronto, Hamilton and London, where there are bigger communities and more resources—that everyone has the opportunity to have those resources available to them as well.", "Back to the bill, certainly we will be supporting the bill. We know that we need to move forward with this and make sure that not only are these patients who are detained looked after, assessed and provided the appropriate support that they need in communities—some of them may be released to communities, though, that I talked about, where supports aren’t available. We need to make sure that the supports are there for them.", "We also need to make sure that as we are moving some increased authority to the Consent and Capacity Board, we also put the resources in place, because, as we’ve heard from a number of people who talked about this, when the court is the authority and makes the orders, the resources are put in place to make sure that whatever treatment is needed is actually accomplished. We need to make sure the resources are put in place, as the authority increases for the consent board, to make sure that when they order things and make recommendations, the resources are available to those people who continue to be detained or are released to the community to make sure they have what they need." ],

As well, the Mental Health and Addictions Leadership Advisory Council, which includes people with lived experience and family members, was consulted.", "We wanted to make sure that these amendments that are now being proposed match what the court struck down and has given us the time to look at and to do.", "With that, again, it is always my honour to stand up in this House and speak." ],

This bill is something that I believe my colleague from Dufferin–Caledon, Sylvia Jones, suggests, if we can get it to committee and get unanimous consent—all three parties worked on the select committee—we could move forward very quickly.

There are lots of problems. In a lot of cases, they don’t have cars. They can’t drive 20 minutes to St. Catharines. There isn’t bus service to get them there.", "Who’s now becoming responsible for mental health in Niagara? It made no sense to close beds and pull out the services—absolutely none. But what’s happening—I don’t know if it’s happening in other communities; I’m sure it’s happening in rural communities in the province of Ontario, where police officers are now taking care of the mental health. What they do is, they pick them up, drive them to St. Catharines, and then, because of the reporting system that they have, they’re sitting in our hospitals for four, five and six hours, or sometimes the entire shift. Is that how we want to treat mental health in the province of Ontario? I say no.", "Then when you take a look at nurses’ safety—I’ve only got a few seconds left—that has to be a concern.

In a region like Mississauga and Brampton, every single year the equivalent of the population of the city of St. Marys moves to our two cities. Each and every year, it means we have to do the equivalent of building St. Marys, Ontario.", "One of the issues we would face in the fast-growing areas, particularly those around the edge of Toronto in the 905 belt, is the problems of growth. In my own community, where I’ve campaigned very aggressively for increased funding for autism and health care and for treatment of mental health—in one of the areas in Peel region, we’ve managed to get something that we’ve long sought, which is our proportional share of funding for mental health problems. We’ve now managed to do that in Peel region, where we represent some 9% of the population of Ontario. That’s now approximately what we’re allocated in funding.", "So in areas like Mississauga and Brampton, our problem is galloping growth, and I’m hoping that the provisions in this act will enable us to meet that challenge as well." ],

Maybe we need to be having a look at each one of those ministries and figuring out how much it is costing us in policing and corrections because we’re using the police to deal with mental health issues, as opposed to health care advocates. How much is it costing us in corrections to keep somebody housed in a correctional facility—$40,000, $60,000 a year that could be used right in our community to provide those services? How much is it costing us in health care or in our schools?", "I think it would be incumbent upon the government to go back and have a look at that, even if they tried a pilot project and moved some of those resources into mental health to make sure that we’re doing the best that we can for every person and every family here in the province of Ontario that deals with these issues on a daily basis.", "Even the cost of health care unrelated to mental health—there’s a huge cost there as well when people don’t have the appropriate resources that they need when they have mental health issues.", "I thank you for the opportunity to speak to this." ],

This is something that has been talked about—actually, the court case I believe was last year, and the government has almost left this literally to the eleventh hour in terms of bringing it forward in the Legislature and having the debate. The House is scheduled to rise for the Christmas break in December—December 10, I believe—and we have to get this bill passed before then or we’re told there are fairly severe consequences. Really, the government should have brought forward this bill for debate earlier. It should have been introduced earlier, and I think we have to put that on the record.", "But at the same time, we recognize that there was a court case. The Ontario Court of Appeal found that certain provisions of the existing Mental Health Act related to the review process for long-term—meaning six months or more—stay in terms of involuntary patients were found to be unconstitutional, which, again, necessitates the government to respond.", "I understand that the Court of Appeal found that “by failing to provide the Consent and Capacity Board ... with the powers to ‘ensure that the conditions of a person’s long-term detention are tailored to reflect the person’s actual level of risk, moving towards their ultimate [re]integration,’” the Mental Health Act, as it is currently constituted, “violates the right to life, liberty and security of the person.", "“In finding that the” Mental Health Act “framework did not provide sufficient procedural oversight and protections, the Court of Appeal highlighted the” Consent and Capacity Board’s “lack of powers:", "“—to determine the security level (both within and outside of a given facility), privileges (including community access), therapy and treatment of long-term involuntary patients; and", "“—to craft orders that would ensure an appropriate balance between public safety and patient liberty.", "“The Court of Appeal suspended the effect of its judgment for one year (until December 23, 2015) to provide the Legislature with time to respond to the decision and amend the legislation accordingly.”", "I express appreciation to the Ontario hospital board for doing this backgrounder on Bill 122 that I made reference to just now.", "Mr. Speaker, the Ontario PC caucus recognizes the devastating effects that mental illness and the attached stigma has on the lives of thousands of Ontarians. I think that all of us in this Legislature know of family, friends, individuals in our community who have been challenged and affected by mental health issues. I think, frankly, the issue of stigma is to some degree—we’re making progress in that respect. There’s a greater degree of understanding in our communities now, given the fact that so many people are affected, perhaps one in five Canadians. We need to do more in terms of the health care system and in terms of our community response to support these families and these individuals and to help them work their way through their mental illnesses.", "We know for sure, Mr. Speaker, that there are many very effective treatments for mental health illnesses. We have cognitive behavioural therapies that I think are very effective in many cases, and of course medication is part of the treatment of many people with mental illness. We’ve made great strides in that direction.", "Obviously, we have much, much more to do. We know, as a PC caucus, that mental health is just as important as physical health. We need to treat it that way, and we need to understand it in those terms. Mental illness, as I said, affects Ontarians of every age and demographic. We know that services in many areas of the province and in many situations and circumstances remain inadequate.", "Recently, the Health Quality Ontario organization released its annual report. That report highlighted the unfortunate reality that hospital readmission rates for patients with mental illness—or education—have not improved in five years, and suicide rates have not improved in a decade. We need to do better for our vulnerable citizens. We need to work to combat the stigma, as I said earlier. Although I think we’ve made progress, we need to do more associated with mental health, start talking and provide greater access to treatment.", "As I said earlier, the purpose of this bill is to come into compliance with the Ontario Court of Appeal decision that I referred to earlier. Currently, the Mental Health Act allows for repeated renewals of patients’ involuntary status: one month after a first certificate of renewal, two months after a second certificate of renewal, and three months for a third or subsequent certificate of renewal. There is no mechanism for civilly detained patients to challenge the conditions of their treatment. The Ontario Court of Appeal ordered that the words “or subsequent” in section 20(4)(b)(iii) of the Mental Health Act be struck out. Technically, that was the ruling of the court, and that’s what we have to respond to.", "This bill creates a certificate of continuation, which is a new form capable of detaining a patient after the expiry of the third certificate of renewal. The certificate of continuation would allow a patient to be detained for a three-month period, similar to the third certificate of renewal. Subsequent certificates of continuation would allow a patient to be detained for further three-month periods. When a patient is issued their first certificate of continuation, they are entitled to apply for a hearing with the Consent and Capacity Board—the CCB, as we sometimes call it—to confirm whether the prerequisites for involuntary status are met. This happens approximately at six and a half months.", "I could go on and on about the details of the bill. I know that when the bill is passed at second reading—which I anticipate and expect it will be, because it seems to enjoy the support of the House—and goes to committee, I would hope that there will be an opportunity for some public hearings, at least. I realize the clock is ticking, but we have to give people an opportunity to have their say on this bill. We’ve talked about some of the situations recently where government bills were referred to committee and the initial suggestion of the government has been that they allow deputants as little as four minutes to make their presentations. Clearly, people need to have a greater opportunity than just four minutes to make a presentation to a standing committee of the Legislature to make recommendations for improvement and change.", "I would also add that there’s an interesting article that I read in The Economist magazine this morning, a fairly recent issue of The Economist. This is their October 24, 2015, issue. They actually do editorials at the front end of the magazine, Mr. Speaker. You may know; you may read it. It’s a magazine that comes out of Great Britain. It is, I think, an authoritative source for news, but it’s also a magazine that promotes the ideas of freer trade and greater liberty. They don’t always advocate bigger government or higher government spending, but in this editorial they actually do when it comes to mental health.", "They say that there is a case to be made for spending more money on mental health by government and by organizations in our communities, and particularly on research into mental health. They talk about the need to expend greater resources on research leading to better solutions. They make some good points that actually talk about not just the situation in Great Britain but worldwide, in particular the OECD.", "I’ll read briefly from this editorial. They say: “Mental ill-health costs as much as 4% of GDP in lost productivity, disability benefits and health care bills, according to the OECD, a think tank. Many illnesses afflict the old disproportionately, but mental illness tends to strike the young, undermining productivity. In Sweden three fifths of new disability claims are for mental ill-health. Lives are cut short: seriously mentally ill people die 15 to 20 years younger than the rest of the population. And the economic burden seems to be growing heavier. A few years ago, the World Economic Forum estimated that in the two decades to 2030 the cumulative cost of mental illness could be $16 trillion", "“Yet spending on research into these conditions is paltry. In most wealthy countries there is a big discrepancy between mental health research spending and the total cost of mental illness.”", "Again, the editorial goes on to make the case for greater expenditure in terms of mental health research. I think that’s something that all of us in this House need to ponder and consider in a time when, obviously, the government is still running a big deficit. It committed to balancing the budget by 2017-18, but, of course, we received the Financial Accountability Officer’s report earlier this week, which called into question whether or not the government will be able to meet that commitment.", "In that fiscal context, where money is tight, we still need to find ways to identify priorities and ensure that the priorities are adequately funded. I think that, certainly, based on the tenor and tone of this debate, there is strong support in this House, from all sides of the House, to ensure that mental health issues are adequately addressed. Again, I would suggest that we need to look into how we’re expending money on research and see if we can find ways to stretch those dollars and do a better job.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I think it is going to receive the support of the House. We look forward to further debate and committee hearings as we try to get it right for the people of Ontario." ],

This bill, needed as it is, is so focused and so specific that it’s missing out on all the other challenges that we have when it comes to accessing mental health services in Ontario.", "Specifically, what I wanted to talk about is the deficit that actually occurs in the northwest. We have many structural challenges that serve as an impediment to us having a healthy society. I just wanted to draw a picture of what happens and how people can access mental health services in the northwest. It is not uncommon for people in small towns in northwestern Ontario to have access to a psychiatrist who comes to our town once a month. That is, once a month, everybody in that town, if you are lucky, gets to see that psychiatrist for maybe the one or two days they are there. Otherwise, they have to travel 200 kilometres. Some members have talked about the challenge that exists with travelling 20 kilometres. That is a challenge, I’m not denying that, but imagine travelling 200 kilometres.", "And then, the other thing that we’re not talking about, too, is the very real and tragic situation that we have among our First Nations youth and the tragic level of youth suicides that are literally an epidemic sweeping through our communities, something that we all know about, something that is incumbent upon us to get together and figure out the solutions to and fix this so that we don’t see our children and our future being lost.

As those familiar notes sound in all corners of our province and our country, we will all turn our minds back to a time that is barely imaginable for us today. This was a time when young women and men were sent to places that they had never heard of or even imagined—places that now stand in infamy with names that are seared into our national memory: Vimy Ridge, Passchendaele, Juno Beach, Ortona, Korea and, more recently, Afghanistan. There are peacekeeping missions as well, missions like Bosnia and Rwanda.", "This was a time when young men and women, and sometimes children, left their families behind, abandoned their textbooks or postponed their careers, and went off to fight and often to die in the service of our country. When confronted with the enormity of what was demanded of these soldiers and the harrowing price that so many paid, the scale of their sacrifice is truly humbling. Often, the depictions of war and peacekeeping missions alike show images of acts of incredible courage. But what we don’t see are the invisible scars—the psychological wounds that our veterans will carry with them for the rest of their lives.", "War is not glamorous. It leaves behind great human devastation. Men, women and children are its victims. It is our responsibility, each and every time we send servicemen and women into active duty, to support them every step of the way, especially when they return home.

It rests on all of us, all Canadians, not to break faith with that commitment.", "Thanks to Canada’s veterans, so many of us and our children will never have to live through the scourge of war.

A grassroots organization was formed to care for children with developmental disabilities since, as was the practice then, they were sent to large institutions away from their families. Very sadly, their parents thought this was their only option. As executive director Judy Pryde said, “Parents were told by medical professionals that they should not, and could not, take care of their children.”", "Today, thanks to the love and determination of those parents, Community Living Burlington has grown to an organization that provides support to more than 400 people with a developmental disability and their families, thanks to an exceptional staff team of over 300 employees. These services include children’s inclusion services, residential supports, employment services and day programs. These programs assist their clients in developing independence, building social, emotional and community participation skills, while encouraging learning and professional development. And they provide important respite to parents and caregivers, too.", "I am deeply grateful I had the opportunity to celebrate 60 wonderful years with Community Living.

Harris and William Earle Thomas. I’m also pleased to welcome two commissioners who have been newly appointed to the commission: Rosemarie McGuire and my constituent Susan Beharriell.", "On November 10, 1915, a group of dedicated Ontarians, with the support of the provincial government, came together to meet a growing need. Thousands of soldiers were returning home from the front lines of the First World War. They were returning with physical and psychological injuries, and there were not sufficient support services to help them. Many did not return, and their families were coping with the devastation of war with little or no support.", "The Ontario Soldiers’ Aid Commission came into being, with its first offices here in the Legislative Building. In the ensuing years, the work of the commission expanded to meet the growing needs of soldiers and their families. By 1916, 37 commission branches were operating in communities throughout Ontario, assisting soldiers by finding work and housing for returning soldiers; arranging training; advocating for fair wages and pensions; reaching out to soldiers’ families who needed help; and, in 1920, being given all the powers of a children’s aid society to serve as the ward for hundreds of Ontario children whose families were impacted by the war.", "In fact, the Soldiers’ Aid Commission was one of the first examples of social services in Ontario. It preceded the formation of Veterans Affairs by 29 years. Later, as Canadians fought in the Second World War and the Korean War, the commission again rose to meet the needs of Ontario’s returning soldiers and families left behind.", "On Remembrance Day, we as a society stop to reflect on the sacrifices of our veterans. The Soldiers’ Aid Commission thinks of those sacrifices every day and continues to provide assistance to Ontario’s veterans and their families. To help celebrate this milestone anniversary, later today commissioners will join the Lieutenant Governor, the Honourable Elizabeth Dowdeswell, for a formal reception in the Lieutenant Governor’s suite.", "To share their important history with Ontarians, the commission has produced a commemorative book entitled Ontario Soldiers’ Aid Commission: 100 Years of Assistance to Veterans in Need, 1915-2015. It chronicles the commission’s century of groundbreaking support and advocacy on behalf of veterans. They fought successfully for services to help veterans return to the workforce and for pensions for veterans and their families.", "Next week, when we pause on Remembrance Day to recall the sacrifices made by Canada’s courageous women and men, I invite all honourable members to also recognize the enormous contributions that the Soldiers’ Aid Commission has made to the lives of Ontario veterans and their families over the past 100 years." ],

For anyone who has a love of Ontario history, Marilyn Churley was a minister of the crown under the Bob Rae government, but what I remember Marilyn Churley for more than anything else was her advocacy and her initiatives related to open adoptions.", "I think all of us in the chamber would agree that the fact that we can look at and support open adoptions has made a huge difference in young people being able to find their forever homes, so I just want to give a shout-out to Marilyn. I think that what she did then and what she did in her post-parliamentary life with her book made a great deal of difference to how people approached adoptions and how people were willing to look at different ways of putting together a family, and quite frankly, I’m sure has made a difference in literally hundreds of young people’s lives. So to Marilyn: Thank you for that. It was just one of those passing things that when I saw her, it was like, “Yes, adoption.”", "Anyway, the action towards more types of adoptions, more abilities for kin care, for people to take on those responsibilities—particularly with young people with challenges—is something that we on this side obviously support and endorse.", "As I say, I’m pleased to see that we continue to raise awareness and encourage people to look at adoption as a wonderful way to expand your family." ],

We need people close to us who can be proud of our successes, who can nurse us through ill health, who can lighten the load of whatever might burden us, who can correct us when we’re wrong. We all make mistakes. Sometimes we really mess things up, and when we do, we need support and help from those around us—the type of support that comes from the unconditional love of a family. We rely on that support not just as children, but throughout our lives. Everyone deserves that, but not everyone has it.", "When adoption is mentioned or when it is portrayed in books or on the screen, we usually think of babies, because adoptees are usually younger children. The fact is that 60% of children and youth available for adoption are over the age of 13, yet only 5% of those adopted are between the ages of 13 and 18. Far too many age out of care, with no support and no idea where to go from there. These youth want, need and deserve a family.", "I think back again to the My Real Life Book report from the Youth Leaving Care Hearings and one particular quote: “Children’s aid saved my life, but at this moment I felt betrayed and abandoned. I was not ready to leave care! I felt their love, guidance and support was unconditional—until I turned 21 and then it became conditional.”", "The very sad reality is that youth who age out of care, those who don’t have a lifelong family, have a hard time as adults. Fewer than 3% will earn a college or university degree. Within the first two years of leaving care, 25% of them will become homeless and 25% will be incarcerated. Some 60% of young women leaving care will have had a child within four years, and that child is twice as likely to end up in care. Like its mother and others gone before, that child will enter the child welfare system through no fault of its own. In many ways, it’s like we have a system that feeds itself in what seems like a never-ending cycle. But by providing a family for life, adoption can make the crucial difference for so many." ],

One hundred years later, it’s hard for us to appreciate just what those times were like, but it is important for us always to remember what those young men, many of them in fact no more than boys, were put through in the service of their country.", "The Canadian Expeditionary Force was the field force created by Canada to serve overseas in the First World War. It was, at the time the Soldiers’ Aid Commission was established, entirely comprised of volunteers, as it was for most of the war. Over 600,000 were enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during its existence from 1914 to 1920. This was at a time when the population of the entire country was about one quarter of what it is today.", "An extraordinary percentage of Canada’s population, the vast majority of them young men, served in the force. They witnessed horrific events and scenes that should be part of no person’s life: the mud, the cold, the rats, the incessant bombs, the sniper’s bullets and the unimaginable carnage that they caused. Many perished on those far-off fields. Those who made it home brought with them physical and emotional scars that would stay with them for the rest of their lives.", "And so the Soldiers’ Aid Commission was established.

Veterans who served in the merchant navy during World War II are also eligible for assistance.", "In the present day, the Soldiers’ Aid Commission provides funds for hearing aids, glasses and dental needs.

At the age of 16, they pay $150 to get their G1, $88 for their G licence, and every five years, it’s another $81 to renew their licence. They pay taxes on the purchase of their first car, even if it’s used. Ils payent des impôts sur l’achat de leur première voiture, même si c’est une voiture d’occasion. Their vehicle licence tag costs them an extra $108 each year, and each time they gas up the vehicle, they pay a fuel tax.", "When they buy their first home, they pay thousands in a land transfer tax, and if this government gets their way, homebuyers will soon be paying additional thousands of dollars for a municipal land transfer tax. I’m hoping that the member for Leeds–Grenville is successful in his fight against this additional tax grab.", "They pay property taxes on their homes and cottages. They pay tax to furnish and renovate their homes, and eco fees on electronics. They pay taxes on insurance premiums for their home and vehicles. They pay taxes on the fees to financial planners who help them manage and grow their savings. They pay capital tax gains when they sell their investments and taxes on interest and dividends from what they earn on those investments. They pay payroll taxes for the employees who help them run the family business or family farm. And this government now plans to bring a giant new payroll tax in the form of the ORPP. I am very thankful that the great member for York–Simcoe continues to wage the campaign against that tax increase.", "They pay a health tax every year even while this government cuts front-line health care services delivered by doctors, nurses and personal support workers. In their senior years, they pay taxes on the money they draw from their investments, and at the end of their lives, taxes are paid on funeral and burial services. À la fin de leur vie, des impôts sont payés sur les services funéraires et les enterrements. And because you are deemed to have sold all of your property at your death, they pay capital gains taxes on the value of most of their assets on their death. Finally, the government charges $15 for that death certificate.", "If you’re getting a common theme here, we pay a lot of tax in Ontario. They tax us from birth to death, and that’s what this private member’s bill is about. It’s to highlight, in a brief summary, the wide variety of taxes throughout our lives in Ontario. That’s why, when I learned of the date for my ballot item, I thought a perfect example for tax relief would be to end the death tax.", "The graduated tax levied on the value of people’s assets on their death is the highest of any province in Canada. Cet impôt est le plus haut dans tout le Canada, de toutes les provinces. C’est seulement 65 $ au Québec, mais en Ontario, c’est plus de 7 000 $ pour un exemple moyen.

They’re actually wrong. It was the Bob Rae government that, in 1992, took the modest probate fee and, by regulation, tripled the fee by calculating it on the value of a deceased person’s assets. The move was challenged in court, and what ended up happening in 1998 is that, based on the court decision, it was required that government put it into law; and it was passed in legislation in 1998.", "So why am I calling for an end to the death tax, when it was actually put into legislation by the PC government in 1998? Well, let’s look at what has happened in the last 20 years in Ontario. In response, I would ask all members of the House to consider the burden that families faced in 1998, compared to the burden we face today.", "In 1998, there was no health tax, no eco fees, no municipal land transfer tax. Sales tax was not payable on as many goods and services as it is today; and on top of that, hydro costs were a lot more affordable. These Liberal taxes add thousands of dollars to the cost of living in Ontario. By the time someone dies, millions in taxes and fees have been paid on savings, purchases and investments. So my bill provides some much-needed relief and acknowledges to the people of Ontario that they pay enough. They pay enough in this province. You are taxed far too much in Ontario.", "Every single one of us in this House can rhyme off the names of constituents we know who have worked hard all their lives to build a business or to see the family farm thrive. When those folks pass away, their families are faced with a whopping bill, with the death taxes payable on the net value of those hard-earned assets. Because all the equity is tied up in hard assets like real estate and equipment, families are often faced with the prospect of selling those hard-earned assets just to pay those death taxes. That just doesn’t make good business sense. Not being able to continue running the family business or the family farm just to pay death taxes is bad for Ontario’s economy. It’s bad for the thousands of people those businesses and farms employ.", "We haven’t seen many good decisions coming from the government benches lately, so we’re hoping that this idea is one that you can rally around. If the government members support this bill today, I’ll be the first to applaud them for showing an example of non-partisanship.", "What I’d ask you to consider is, if you’re talking to your constituents, try to imagine a single constituent in your riding who would say this would be the wrong step for Ontario. You will find universally that your constituents fundamentally believe we are overtaxed in this province, and this is a gesture of fairness. So for those government members here today, and voting later today, consider that. Please do the right thing. Support this bill. You’ll have a great opportunity to do the right thing." ],

I’m pleased to lend some of the feedback that I’ve received from my constituency of Kitchener–Waterloo, but also to relay that over the last year, as our family has moved through the grieving process of losing both in-laws in the space of a year and actually going through this process, that’s when we first learned about when the changes to the estate administration tax came into effect, and how little communication had been shared about those changes. It was an eye-opening experience.", "There is context and there is history, and the member from Simcoe also referenced the backstory as to how we got to this place in history in the province of Ontario. I’m going to address that as well.", "I think it’s important for those people who are at home to understand that as parties we don’t always see these issues the same way. As it relates to Bill 136, the Estate Administration Tax Abolition Act, 2015, this PMB is proposing that Ontario entirely get rid of the estate administration tax altogether, which is not done anywhere else in the country. Nowhere else—no other jurisdiction—has abolished and gotten rid of the estate administration tax.", "This act essentially widens existing income inequality between the generations, and I’ll touch on that in a few minutes. It also incentivizes wealthy individuals to amass their fortunes instead of spending them, and pass them on to future generations. Neither abolishing nor capping the estate administration tax at the high end is progressive. New Democrats, however, are open to reviewing the rates of taxation, recognizing that Ontarians pay the highest estate tax rate in the country. This is where we have to have a conversation about how we got to this place and some of the changes that are actually taking place around estate administration taxation as proposed by the Liberals.", "We of course have serious concerns about Bill 136. We also have immense concerns about how the changes to the estate administration tax came into play in Ontario. We do not support the Liberals’ regulatory changes that came into force in January 2015 with little warning, and it’s disappointing to know that this government has introduced tight deadlines within which an individual must file a detailed description of the deceased’s assets, and sanctions for failure to comply with these regulations. Those sanctions could include jail time, Mr. Speaker, if you can imagine that. They have only managed to create a more onerous and expensive estate administration process and for no good reason at all.", "We do, however, believe that the government’s new tight deadlines were introduced under the radar. There was a regulatory change as of January this past year, with little warning, that has only managed to make the process more expensive and somewhat painful. The 90-day window to file a detailed description of the deceased’s assets and the sanctions for failure to comply with this tight timeline have only made what is a very challenging experience more challenging.", "I reference the fact that we have lost both of our in-laws this year—this is not uncommon. My in-laws, Walter and Shirley Fife, were married for 60 years. My father-in-law passed away during the election, and within the year, Shirley Fife passed away as well. There are nine children, and this was one house for 60 years. So they had 60 years of stuff in that house. It has been a process. It’s really interesting, because the stuff means nothing once your loved one passes away; it really doesn’t.", "Walter Fife was very fond of saying, “You can’t take it with you so share it with the people in your life.” And in good, Scottish spirit, he also didn’t believe in throwing too much out. He was a big recycler—the new-age, or old-age, recycler—so as a family, we have been going through this house just outside of Peterborough. It was a life well lived, but the process of grieving and going through this process of listing this estate and these material goods has only added an entirely new layer of grief, I have to tell you. There is so much at play.", "The confusion about what our legal liabilities—of course, of those nine children one of them has to be the executor; in this instance, it’s the baby because that’s the most responsible one. But the process has been—quite honestly, the liability that the executor has going through this situation will dissuade other people from being executors, because there is liability and risk. Now the Liberals have introduced the threat of jail time if compliance is not followed through on.", "When the member for Lambton–Kent–Middlesex brought up his issue, I thanked him for raising it, because we need to be talking about this estate administration tax. I didn’t agree with the caps they set; I didn’t agree with the process. But I did thank them for raising this. We see the commercials on TV that the government has put out right now on the ORPP and on the new sex education curriculum; you haven’t seen anything right now on significant changes to the estate administration tax. All of us throughout the summer and into the fall have been hearing from constituents. I must say, there’s a great deal of concern and confusion.", "It is unfortunate, though, that some of that confusion, I think, and I’m not sure if the member from Simcoe really realizes this—they’re sort of playing on this one fear about the changes that had come in. So, aside from the 90-day window, there is this misunderstanding and a little bit of fearful playfulness, if you will, that somehow assets held before death but not at the time of death—such as insurance payable to a named beneficiary, assets where there is joint ownership with right of survivorship, and real estate outside of Ontario—are not included in the value of the estate. The insurance is not part of this, Mr. Speaker. I think that prior to the changes it was permissible to provide a total valuation of the deceased’s estate. The process must be simplified. It must be simplified. The 90-day deadline is really quite something.", "The member from Simcoe referenced the issue of how we got here. It is ironic in many respects that the Conservative party continue to put forward private member bills on this issue. To go back in time, back to 1998, after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that disguising probate fees as a tax was unconstitutional in Ontario, then-Premier Mike Harris had the opportunity to get rid of the probate fees, just get rid of them if they had an issue with them. He, however, decided to reintroduce it as an estate administration tax in order to continue to collect the revenue. This is part of our history as a province.", "It is true, though, at the time, Bob Rae—you know Bob Rae, who now identifies as a Liberal—did increase the rates, Mr. Speaker; Bob Rae did. What can I say? He just keeps on giving and giving. Here we are. That’s the history of the estate administration tax, how it came to be in this place.", "This bill will seek to abolish it and it will cap the fees for filing an estate certification with the court. They are proposing a couple of amendments, which we can’t support. For us, this bill doesn’t get to the heart of the issue of how the Liberals have moved forward with the estate administration tax, how the timelines came into play, why there was no consultation and the sanctions that are attached to the administration part of that tax.", "What we’ve heard mostly from our constituents is that there was so little notice. Until you find yourself in this untenable position of dealing, usually in a crisis and, as I said, going through the grieving process—you don’t fully realize how onerous this situation is. As I mentioned, we are open to looking at the taxation rates, but this bill, Bill 136, does not get to the heart of the issue that people are feeling in the province of Ontario. Just abolishing the estate administration tax is not the answer.", "I do want to make sure that people fully understand this, that the government’s new, tight deadlines, which came into effect just this January—this 90-day window to file a detailed description of the deceased’s assets, and sanctions for failure to comply with this tight timeline—have only made this process more difficult. Bill 136 does not address the key issue of this. You must be hearing it. The concerns of constituents don’t stop halfway through this Legislature.", "I just want to leave the Legislature with this one thing. According to a 2012 Ontario Common Front report, Ontario experienced the largest change in income inequality of any province in Canada over the last generation. This is from 1981 to 2010. The fact is that if you were born after 1981, you have lived every year of your life in a society that is becoming more unequal. Progressive tax measures are therefore important. As Walter Fife used to say—he didn’t mind paying taxes, as long as those taxes were put to good use, like education, like health care, and as long as they weren’t wasted.", "I must say, there’s a fair amount of waste. As I try to follow the money in this place, it becomes more and more convoluted. Even when financial accountability officers report economic modelling to this government, this government refuses to acknowledge that that independent fiscal analysis has some credibility and is valuable to them and, more importantly, to the people of this province.", "I thank the member from Simcoe North for raising the issue of the estate administration tax, but New Democrats cannot support a taxation change that is not progressive." ],

I believe she knows that the lineage of the Fife family, of course, goes right back to David Fife, who was the discoverer, in Peterborough county, of Red Fife wheat, which was a great variety of wheat that would withstand rust. It was grown exclusively throughout Ontario. During the Laurier days, it was transported to western Canada, and Red Fife wheat became the staple of Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba. The member from Kitchener–Waterloo should take great pride in the legacy of her family, the Fife family.", "It’s very interesting today.

I believe that this original piece of taxation was brought in in 1998, when Michael Harris was the Premier of the province of Ontario. Normally, I’m a person who wouldn’t want to undo the great legacy of one Michael Harris, the wonderful member from Nipissing.", "I do want to talk about a little history here. Back in 1963, when Lester Pearson, who spent some time in the great riding of Peterborough as a student, became Prime Minister of Canada, part of his platform was to establish the Carter commission on progressive taxation. The late Walter Gordon, of course, was his finance minister. The first Gordon budget was to initiate the Carter commission, the Royal Commission on Taxation, because there generally was a feeling that taxation in Canada lacked a number of progressive measures.", "For those members in the House, they should take the time to go to the legislative library—the volumes of the Carter commission are there; they make great nighttime reading—to look at the exact details of taxation in Canada.", "When Mr. Carter started his commission, he started it from this premise: He said, “A buck is a buck is a buck,” and that things should be taxed from that principle—so every buck that’s earned through income and other ways should be taxed in a very progressive measure.", "Mr. Speaker, you wouldn’t expect me to say that Mr. Harris may have brought in something very progressive in 1998. I certainly don’t know his thinking back in 1998, because I never got the privilege to be here until 2003. But I know you were a Harris insider in those days, as a member of the caucus, so I know you know exactly what Mr. Harris was thinking back in 1998. You and Gary Carr and others were there together, contributing input during that government, I’m sure. I don’t want to quote you, but I’m quite sure you and Mr. Carr and others were saying to the Premier of the day, “This is a pretty progressive idea that we want to bring forward in 1998,” in terms of putting a level of taxation on estates in Ontario to reflect what has always been the principle, whether it’s taxation across Canada or taxation at the provincial level, going back to the Carter commission that “a buck is a buck is a buck”; and that should always be the principle of applying taxes not only in the provinces but indeed throughout Canada.", "So I look at this bill today. The member from Kitchener–Waterloo raised some very good points. I do have my speaking points now; I better get back to the speaking points to keep the people in the whips’ office happy. I’ve got to get back to the speaking points.", "During the development of the regulation, consultations were held with the Ontario Bar Association, the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee of the province of Ontario, and the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners. This regulation was modified in response to some feedback that was received.", "Mr. Speaker, I know you’re a very fair individual. You would know that if you were consulting on such an issue in terms of estate taxation, you would consult with the Ontario Bar Association, representing all the very distinguished lawyers in the province of Ontario. You would also consult with the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee and you would also consult with the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners. That is very important.", "I can see them now, the good folks in Peterborough riding; they’re clicking on their Cogeco clicker, station 95, to watch what is going on here this afternoon. So I want to say hello to all those good folks from Peterborough who have just tuned in.", "We want to make sure that the new regulation in place is equally applied across the board, that people know about that. To be fair, I have received emails on this particular issue and I wanted to reply back that we’re not introducing a new tax to the province of Ontario.

This government isn’t spending the people’s money well, but they think that if they can just get their hands on more of it, then their problems will simply go away. So they bring new taxes and fees or create new expensive audit and verification bureaucracies to make sure every penny of tax is collected, but the truth is this: This strategy is only making things worse in Ontario.", "When taxes are lower, economic growth follows. History has shown us that tax cuts create jobs. Letting people keep more money of their own money gives them more choice. It opens up new possibilities. It allows them to invest in their education, start a small business, buy a home or give their children better opportunities. This money flows back into the economy and lifts other people higher up the economic ladder. Lowering taxes also keeps governments accountable by compelling them to spend smarter and actually set priorities. That’s exactly what we need in the province of Ontario.", "The death tax is a perfect example of overtaxing. It’s a tax on assets that the government has already collected a lifetime of taxes on. Right now, Ontario takes a bigger cut of its people’s estates than any other province in Canada. Because of changes made by this Liberal government, grieving families trying to settle the affairs of their loved ones have new, harsh deadlines and the threat of jail time and steep fines hanging over their heads. This crackdown is extremely onerous for grieving families, and it’s the wrong direction to be heading in.", "This is a deeply unfair tax. The Liberals like to pretend that getting rid of the death tax only helps the rich, but the truth is just the opposite. This is a tax that applies to anyone who has assets worth over $1,000. The wealthy, who can afford good legal advice, are easily able to avoid this tax. This economic and emotional burden falls disproportionately on the shoulders of the middle- and lower-income classes. It amounts to a tax on a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice.

That happens from time to time in this place; this is a Liberal government that doesn’t want to take any responsibility for its actions.", "The government of Mike Harris was forced to bring in a piece of legislation to comply with a previous tax that was brought in by an even earlier government led by Bob Rae, so it became, effectively, an administrative tax. But let me say this, in terms of the estate tax: The first time we actually started talking about a death tax in this chamber was when the Liberal government rushed through, in unprecedented form, the HST. Funeral directors and others were going to have to bring in a new tax that was going to burden those whose family members were recently deceased or were going to be.", "Throughout this period of time, we’ve seen a Liberal government that has not only brought in the single largest sales tax increase in Ontario’s history with the HST, but they brought in the single largest income tax increase in Ontario’s history, as well, with a health tax. Now that we have those two taxes, the Liberal government is talking about a land transfer tax, a fuel tax; they’re talking about a payroll tax. This is a government that can’t get enough taxes. They actually snuck in an eco tax on Canada Day a few years ago. But none is more unfair and insensitive as an increase of the estate tax.", "What I found compelling when my leader spoke earlier today were the comparisons with other jurisdictions. In my time, I’d just like to point out that in Ontario an estate valued at $500,000 would have to pay $7,250 in tax. If you’re in Quebec, that number is $65. Now, I don’t have to tell members here that I come from the nation’s capital. Across the river is Quebec, and there is a massive inequity if you’re from the city of Ottawa, where I live, compared to the city of Gatineau, which is just across the water.", "With that in mind, I encourage all colleagues in this assembly to support PC leader Patrick Brown’s bill, and I congratulate him for taking such a strong stand." ],

So I just wanted to bring up that historical point of view. Normally, I wouldn’t want to stand in the way of someone who wants to undo the Mike Harris legacy. But one thing that really surprises me about this is that it’s the Leader of the Opposition’s first bill, and I’m wondering why he chose to make this issue his very top priority. I would have thought that there were other important bills that he may have wanted to make his top priority and leave this down on the list.", "We’ve got a lot of issues on the table right now. A lot of people are looking for projects for infrastructure. A lot of people are looking for support on other important pieces of legislation today, so that was just a comment that I wanted to make. I know that we’re also looking for pension security, and tackling climate change, so I’m just a little surprised that this would be his top priority.", "Ultimately, I know that the constituents in my riding are a little worried that rich heirs and heiresses are the ones who pay most of this tax, but I know that the constituents in my riding are also wanting to make sure that those who are the wealthiest among us don’t pay the least amount of tax. They are hoping that they can pay their fair share, and I think that is very important.", "Leaving aside some of the discussion of priorities, what I find most telling about the private member’s bill that the Leader of the Opposition has brought forward is that he is gung-ho to forgo the over $150 million in revenues that is generated by this measure, but he has absolutely no idea how he would offset that revenue loss. This is real money. This is a program whose funds are making a real difference in Ontarians’ lives." ],

And it’s not just chump change; these are all billion-dollar scandals. They are out of money. They need every penny they can get. They shake the couches looking for nickels and dimes, and now they’re shaking the coffins as well.", "On January 1 of this year, changes to Ontario’s estate administration tax quietly came into force. I know the other critic has mentioned that as well. It really was done quietly. It was done by regulation. It was done surreptitiously, hoping nobody would notice it. We have noticed it. For about a one-month period, it was the most popular email that I was receiving in my office—people asking about how dare they do this. The “this” that we’re talking about is not a tax, as some have erroneously even suggested, that had anything to do with a Conservative government in the past. The Conservative government specifically changed the name of it. The dollar value never changed under the Conservative government, and I defy anybody to look at the Hansard and prove any differently than that.", "Quite frankly, I get tired of that. I get tired of digging up material from 20 years ago and trying to blame everything on it. They’re out of money. They want to tax you through death now. This is the fact. Our leader, Patrick Brown, has brought a proposal to the table, which I hope receives due consideration today, that says, “Enough is enough.” We’ll charge a modest amount to cover the costs, and no more, but not this thousands of dollars that families are going to have to put together to pay this death tax. And they’d better darn well put it together fast because, as you also heard from the NDP critic, you can go to jail if you don’t—just what a family needs at a time of grieving.", "Earlier today, we proved to this Legislature, through newly revealed documents, yet another tax, this chromite tax. It’s all about taxing minerals. This government cannot find enough money to satisfy their hunger to spend. It’s tax and spend, tax and spend, and now they’re taxing you after you’re dead.

I am only doing it as a result of a tragedy that took place, mostly in my riding, on September 22.", "September 22 started out as a beautiful day. We were all down—or up, whatever you want to say—at the International Plowing Match in Finch when the news broke that a body had been discovered in my riding: A woman had been murdered.", "As the day went on, the news became much, much worse. As the final news was in, we were made aware that three women had been murdered in my riding on that terrible day, September 22.", "We found out that Anastasia Kuzyk, aged 36; Nathalie Warmerdam, aged 48; and Carol Culleton, aged 66, were all murdered, allegedly, by Basil Borutski. The news filled the air over the next several days, as did people’s feelings about how this could happen. How could this happen here in Renfrew county, where we believe sometimes that we’re immune to these kinds of events?", "What we learned afterwards is what makes us question, perhaps, how well the system works. That is what in many ways has precipitated my bringing forth this private member’s bill today. What we learned in the aftermath was that Mr. Borutski had a history of violence, not only with at least two of these women, but with his ex-wife, as well. He had been in brushes with the law due to domestic violence since the mid-1990s; and on more than one occasion, as part of those proceedings through the court system, some of those charges were bargained away as if they didn’t really happen; they were stayed, so the convictions were of a less egregious nature than they might have otherwise been, if the full record had been clearly delineated.", "That Friday night, my wife and I attended a vigil in Wilno, which would be closest to the home of Anastasia Kuzyk, who was also a real estate agent, like my wife. They’d had dealings on a periodic basis over the years, as normally you would have, one real estate agent to another. Of course, Anastasia was tremendously well respected in that field. She also worked part-time as a server at the Wilno Tavern, and was extremely popular there as well.", "Right across the road from the Wilno tavern, at Wilno Heritage Park, was where the vigil was held. I would say, Speaker, that there were about 700 people in attendance that night. It was a wonderfully done ceremony, tremendously emotional, and not done with an emotion of revenge or anything else; it was about supporting the families of the victims, but also each one of us examining ourselves as to what we could do to make victims of domestic violence safer in their own homes at a time when the perpetrator would be released.", "That is something that came back to me over and over again in the riding as I would speak to people over the next several weekends. We were sitting, so when I would go home on the weekends, I would hear about that an awful lot. There was a tremendous amount of news coverage—not only in the local papers, but in major papers like the Ottawa Citizen and the Ottawa Sun, as well—because this was a shocking event for people in my riding.", "What I decided I could do—and I don’t pretend for a minute, Speaker, to be able to solve this problem, or to fix the problem, or to prevent things from ever happening again, but I did ask myself: What would be a reasonable first step? I want to be very clear: This is not an indictment of the government. This is not an indictment of members of the cabinet. It is simply an opportunity for us to all ask ourselves if there is something we could do that would actually make this province safer for victims of domestic violence.", "I’m not going to go into the long history of Mr. Borutski too greatly, because I don’t have that much time, but as I said, it was extensive. That in itself goes back to his ex-wife; the first time there were breaches was in the mid-1990s. That history continued until, obviously, September 22. But he had recently been released. And here is the nub of the matter: When he was released, Mr. Borutski refused to sign the parole order that is presented to every person who is eligible for parole, that they’re expected to sign. He refused to sign it. Critics will say that the terms of the order are valid whether the parolee signs it or not. But like a lot of people, I believe that if you accept that you have wronged, if you believe that you have paid part of that debt but that you accept that you breached the law and you injured someone else and did harm to them, then you would have no problem signing those papers. That is part of the rehabilitation process, and maybe the first part other than the incarceration. When he chose not to sign those, that in itself was a statement that he did not feel the remorse and did not feel the guilt he should have felt. That should have raised a red flag. I know critics will say, “That’s not a big deal.” Well, maybe it should be a big deal. That’s part of what this bill is all about: If a person eligible for parole, upon their release, will not sign those papers, they will not be released. As I said, this is not a cure-all, but it is a step in the right direction.", "There’s one other component to this bill, and I’ll get to that.", "The other issue—and I know some of my colleagues and hopefully people in the other parties here today will speak to it as well: As I say, there are many, many facets about how we can make victims of domestic violence or sexual domestic violence safer. I’m only going to address some of them today. There are issues that we do need to talk about.", "The probation officers in Renfrew county—to our knowledge, there is one. That’s insufficient. With the workload they have, they cannot spend enough time monitoring the offenders who should be monitored the most.", "I think we need a graduated system where, if someone is released and there’s a determination that they are a very, very low risk, they shouldn’t see their parole officer very often; but if someone has a record that goes back 20 years, then they should be seeing that parole officer on a much more frequent basis. If nothing else, it is a statement to that parolee: “We are monitoring you. We are watching you. We are interacting with you. We need feedback from you on how you’re reintegrating back into society and how it’s affecting you.”", "A well-trained probation officer can read between the lines and can see in a person’s eyes—if they have those personal, face-to-face interactions, they have a better sense of how that person is dealing with the challenges of reintegrating into society. So we need to address that. My bill does not address that. But those are all part of the things that we’re hoping that—as a result of this, we as a unit here, as a group, begin to talk, begin to sit down and say, “Are there some things we could do as a government?”", "I’ve had some feedback, as well, that we lack enough proper supports to support women who are in abusive relationships, to allow them to exit them with a feeling of comfort and safety, knowing there’s a place to go before it goes too far. I’m not here to judge. I’m not the jury. But in the case of Mr. Borutski’s first wife, Mary Ann, if she had had the proper supports or felt she did have the supports earlier, we may have seen this pattern from Mr. Borutski a lot earlier and maybe more could have been done about it.", "I can’t speak to the past. I’m only talking about what we can do in the future.", "The other component of my bill is that upon a person’s release, if they’ve been deemed a violent offender in a case of domestic violence or sexual domestic violence, unless the board feels that this person is no longer a risk, does not pose a risk to their victim—unless they make that determination, then that person will be subject to electronic surveillance as well. I do not prescribe in the bill the details of that. That’s not my job. We have bureaucrats that can do that. We leave that to the government to do as regulation for the length of time, and that’s where I think all of those things, through regulation and through the parole system, can be determined much better than I can do it by defining it in a piece of legislation.", "But these two steps, I believe, will help to ensure that we will not see, hopefully, a repeat of the deaths of Anastasia, Nathalie and Carol. I cannot say that I guarantee that, but what I hope is—if my bill passes today, I’ll be very thankful of that, but at the very least, if it encourages this government to act upon its own—I believe they are more capable of acting in a comprehensive way and taking into consideration everything that needs to be considered. They will do a better job than I can of drafting a piece of legislation. I understand that; I accept that. I would be more than happy to support any piece of legislation that accomplishes what we’re trying to do here today and makes victims of domestic violence safer upon the release of the perpetrator of that crime." ],

Any forum we can use to talk about this should be exploited.", "I know that the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke appreciates that violence against women is a complicated, ongoing problem in our society that requires much more thought, debate, consultation and action than can be accomplished in a single private member’s bill, just as the member has actually said. Violence against women and girls is seen in all continents, countries and cultures. It happens at every age and in every income group. No group is safe, and the prevalence of it requires constant inquiry, education and action.", "Half of all women in Canada have experienced at least one incident of physical or sexual violence. Every six days, a woman in Canada is killed by her intimate partner. Each year, even though 80% of incidents go unreported to police, there are still over 40,000 arrests made relating to domestic violence.", "I’m sure, as MPPs, we are all aware of the pressures on shelters for abused women in our communities due to underfunding. Just this week, I attended a fundraiser for the Good Shepherd’s Mary’s Place, one of Hamilton’s shelters. I heard over and over about the number of women who had to be turned away due to the lack of beds. That’s a problem we hear from every corner of this province.", "As I noted earlier, women in all societal groups are victims of violence at alarming rates, but there are some groups who are at particular risk; for example, aboriginal women in Canada are five times more likely than other women of the same age to die as a result of violence.", "The majority of voters in this last recent federal election voted for parties that supported an inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. I hope we can count on our provincial government to make sure that their friends in Ottawa fulfill that commitment to do that.

I see no issues with a requirement that an inmate sign their certificate of parole, but I would like to hear more discussion about how best to monitor people on parole who pose a threat. While electronic monitoring is a useful tool, parole officers have, for some time, called for more resources for front-line and on-site inspections.", "So this bill is supportable, as far as it goes. Again, I would like to thank the member for bringing it forward. But this government really needs to take some serious steps. We need to increase our commitment to prevention, we must adequately fund education and counselling programs that ensure that men are held accountable for changing their behaviour, and we need to ensure that the availability of support services for women experiencing violence are there for them.", "I appreciate the time to add my two cents to this bill and congratulate the member for it." ],

When it comes to supervising offenders in the community, our priority is to assure that we have the appropriate level of supervision to support rehabilitation and, above all, to ensure that our communities are safe. That is why our probation and parole officers, who are among the finest in the world, work hard every day to supervise offenders and hold them accountable.", "Indeed, the safety of our communities is paramount when making supervision decisions. Over the past couple of years, the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services has made important progress on a number of areas related to community corrections. This includes things like focusing offender programs and resources on medium- to high-risk offenders and increasing training for probation and parole officers, with a specific focus on domestic violence and sexual offender supervision.

And importantly, there already exists a legislative requirement that an inmate can be required to sign a certificate of parole unless there are compelling or exceptional circumstances, such as a disability, that can prevent their signing.", "In closing, more work needs to be done to better understand how Bill 130 can improve the safety and security of our community.

I cannot begin to imagine what the families and friends of those victims are actually going through. The entire ordeal has raised many questions about whether gaps in the system contributed to this tragedy, if it could have been avoided, and how the justice system could have done a better job to protect these three women.

Additionally, he believes that other services that are aimed at preventing such violence are underfunded. As the member for Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke noted, rehabilitation is the ultimate goal. That is why the province’s underfunding of mental health services and understaffing of parole offices is so tragic.", "While it may not be possible to completely eradicate domestic violence and other despicable acts, any efforts that can increase the safety of the public should be, in fact, supported.

They must agree to follow the law before they’re released back into our communities.", "As it stands today, inmates can actually be released and granted parole even if he or she has refused to sign their certificate of parole.

Many Ontarians are, in fact, shocked to learn of this gap in the system. It is simply common sense to require parolees to sign these certificates.", "This bill will give peace of mind to victims when their attacker is released on parole. Victims of sexual or domestic violence often serve a sentence much longer than their attackers, and their sense of security can be taken away from them for the rest of their lives. They have a right to feel safe. Electronic monitoring will help give them peace of mind, and that is incredibly important. Additionally, it will help the province determine whether or not parolees are observing the terms of their release.", "This bill serves to continue the conversation about how best to protect the public from these extreme acts of violence. This is what the bill serves to do. This issue requires a lot more discussion than one afternoon in the Legislature, Mr. Speaker, but this is certainly a start. This bill will make a difference, and that is worth supporting." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s my pleasure to rise as women’s issues critic for the NDP caucus to offer some thoughts on Bill 130, the private member’s bill brought forward by the member for Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke. First off, I want to commend the member for his obvious concern and his commitment to this issue. I think we all heard the pain that he expressed and his grief at the horrific murders last month of Anastasia Kuzyk, Nathalie Warmerdam and Carol Culleton. These homicides occurred in his riding and have motivated him to bring this bill forward.", "I also want to acknowledge that in May of this year, the member attended the Ottawa meeting of the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment, and there he, along with the other members of the committee, heard directly from the Women’s Sexual Assault Centre of Renfrew County about some of the unique barriers and challenges that face women in small and rural communities. We heard about the geographical remoteness in an area that’s as large as PEI that makes violence and abuse more easily hidden. We heard about community norms that make it even more difficult for rural women to come forward and seek help. We heard about lack of access to transportation, fewer opportunities for employment, lack of child care, and high levels of poverty, all of which force women to stay in abusive relationships. Finally, we heard about access to weapons, as well as numerous situations where the judiciary allows the return of weapons to offenders because it is hunting season.", "I know that this legislation comes from a good place, and it is attempting to address one of the most pernicious public policy problems plaguing governments worldwide, and that is how to end men’s violence against women and keep women safe. Unfortunately, however, it is uncertain whether the provisions set out in Bill 130 could have prevented the murders in Renfrew county. It is also questionable how much impact they will have in ensuring the safety of women and children in the future.", "Bill 130 amends the Ministry of Correctional Services Act to allow for the electronic monitoring of sexual violence and domestic violence offenders as a condition of parole when they are considered to pose a safety risk to the victims. It also requires offenders to sign a certificate of parole acknowledging the conditions under which the parole is granted.", "The first amendment certainly is consistent with a recommendation that we heard from the Hadley inquest, the inquest that was established to review the domestic homicide of Gillian Hadley. In that recommendation brought forward in the 2002 report of the inquest, it was specified that electronic monitoring technology be used both for parole and also for bail, and that it involve a GPS system to best capture the whereabouts of the offender.", "What we know from parole officers is that electronic monitoring in and of itself is not enough. There is also information that needs to be understood and released to parole officers related to the circumstances of the parole.", "We also know that there is a need for more resources for front-line, on-site inspections so that parole officers can regularly check in to monitor the whereabouts the parolee. JoAnne Brooks, the director of the Women’s Sexual Assault Centre of Renfrew County, has pointed to the fact that Renfrew needs better funding so that probation officers can meet with offenders on a regular, if not daily, basis during their reintegration into the community.", "Ms. Brooks also pointed out the difficulty of implementing a monitoring program when you have such a very large rural area as Renfrew county, which is under-resourced in both policing and in community services.", "Earlier this year, we learned that the local OPP domestic violence program is being phased out in Renfrew and other areas of the province, which has raised very real concerns about the impact of this phase-out on coordination across the county and on survivors. There is concern among violence-against-women advocates that this may be part of a larger trend.", "I want to read from the 2015 summer newsletter of Building a Bigger Wave, a provincial network of violence against women coordinating committees. They say that at the southwest region table, a discussion took place in light of the Renfrew OPP situation. Disturbingly, a few months ago, a Toronto Ministry of the Attorney General corporate manager who oversaw domestic-violence-related programs said in a meeting with transfer payment agencies that they should prepare themselves for program and funding changes, as domestic violence is no longer the shiny object for this government.", "If this is true and there is a decreased political commitment to ending domestic violence, then we are unlikely to see the implementation of evidence-based measures that could actually make a difference. What those measures are are effective systems for threat assessment and risk management.", "The 2009 report of the Domestic Violence Advisory Council describes in detail what is necessary to be included in an effective risk management and threat assessment system. These kinds of measures have been recommended in every single Domestic Violence Death Review Committee report since that committee was first established in 2003. About a third of the hundreds of recommendations that have been made by the Domestic Violence Death Review Committee are specific to threat assessment and risk management.", "The 2009 report indicates that the initiatives that have been introduced around threat assessment and risk management have been isolated, fragmented and inconsistent. This is a real concern when we’re looking at ending violence against women and keeping women safe.", "One of the benefits of threat assessment is that it can lead to better risk management. It can assist in developing more realistic safety plans, it can identify appropriate perpetrator treatment programs, and it can help the criminal justice system identify which offenders need closer supervision. Instead of a systematic, coordinated approach to risk management and perpetrator treatment, we have seen from this government a one-size-fits-all intervention model that does not differentiate between high-risk offenders and low- to moderate-risk offenders. It does not provide treatment for men who voluntarily want to change.", "Without this coordinated system of threat assessment and risk measurement, the measures set out in Bill 130 will have only minimal impact. I encourage the government to look at the 2009 report and to look at these measures in Bill 130 in terms of that larger context." ],

I really appreciate, too, how he’s brought this forward in a very non-partisan way with respect to a very serious issue. I think the more we can talk in this House about domestic violence and sexual violence, the better we are and the better Ontarians we’ll be.", "I think it’s also important to acknowledge that both of my critics on the women’s file are here today—thank you for being here—and a number of members from the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment are here. While I know their mandated focus is sexual violence, I also know that they’ve heard first-hand from many deputants and others about domestic violence. We all know, Speaker, that sexual violence and domestic violence are often intertwined.", "I want to use my time to talk a little bit about what has been going on in Ontario with respect to supporting victims of domestic violence, who are usually women, but sometimes they’re men as well. Some of those initiatives include programs like the Neighbours, Friends and Families public education campaign, which is reaching out to communities across the province, including francophones, aboriginals, immigrants and refugee communities.", "There’s also training for more than 34,000 front-line professionals and service providers to recognize signs of domestic violence and to learn how to support victims effectively. The member talked about that in the opening remarks for this bill. I think helping to support victims is a very important piece of this complicated puzzle.", "I also want to mention the Employment Training for Abused/At-Risk Women Program, which provides women with specialized supports and services to help increase employability and income earning.", "We also have a Language Interpreter Services Program, which helps victims of violence, including human trafficking, who face language barriers or who are deaf or hard-of-hearing to allow them to access services. We’re investing over $9 million in this program over the next three years so that all women, regardless of the language they speak, are able to access supportive services without facing barriers.", "I’ve talked at length in this House about our sexual violence and harassment action plan. We established earlier this year a permanent Roundtable on Violence Against Women. It’s not just sexual violence; it’s all forms of violence against women. There are many experts on that panel giving us advice on our violence-against-women programming to support the work to combat sexual violence, harassment and domestic violence. This is, of course, very valuable feedback to us and actually informed the legislation that I introduced just last week coming out of the action plan.", "A couple of things in terms of support for victims: I want to mention that the sexual violence and harassment action plan, if passed, would amend the Limitations Act and the Compensation for Victims of Crime Act. What is proposed there is the elimination of the limitations period for all sexual assault actions to encourage more survivors of sexual assault to come forward with their cases, regardless of how long it’s been since that incident occurred.", "We’re also proposing changes to the Compensation for Victims of Crime Act to eliminate the current two-year limitation period for victims of sexual or domestic violence to be able to apply for compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.", "These are very important changes, because we know that, sometimes, survivors don’t feel comfortable coming forward about assaults immediately, so allowing more time, I believe, is the right thing to do. If passed, that will allow civil processes to move forward quickly.", "I would say that this is a very important conversation that we’re having here today. We’re having important conversations at the all-party select committee looking at sexual violence and harassment—and, I would suggest, domestic violence.", "The member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke is doing something very important here, bringing this discussion forward. I don’t know if he knows that I am also responsible for youth justice in this province. As the Minister of Children and Youth Services, all the youth justice facilities fall under my ministry, as well. In fact, that probably takes up about half of my budget. So I’m looking at the bill he’s bringing forward and what else we can do, not just on the correctional ministry side, but on the youth justice side. We obviously want young people who are incarcerated to have productive lives when they come out of the system, and to make sure that they get the right kind of supports and become responsible adults as they move through the system.", "Again, I thank the member for bringing this very important PMB forward, and I look forward to the continuing discussion." ],

There’s little doubt that there is not an easy fix for this issue. We all have terrible stories that come out of our own ridings, our own communities. I really applaud the member because he has taken a terribly tragic event and he’s trying to bring forward a very detailed, specific idea that we can all embrace. So I give him a lot of credit for that. We’ve talked a lot in this Legislature about electronic monitoring, and there are always the “yes-buts” that come with it: “Yes, but the cause.” “Yes, but how do we ensure, depending on where people move throughout the province?” The fact is that he has brought it forward and said, “Let’s study it. Let’s get this idea on the table so that we can look at how to make lives better, primarily for women who are being targeted, abused and, ultimately, in this case, tragically killed by individuals who feel they have some sort of power over them.”", "There are two very specific ideas that he has brought forward. The electronic monitoring: In this day and age of digitalizing and opportunities—I think we can do a better job. The other is signing the certificate of parole. When news came out that to be eligible for parole, you did not have to sign off on the statements of what you would maintain under your parole; when it came forward that you in fact did not have to sign that certificate, I was shocked and appalled, like many people I spoke to in my community.", "When you put your name to a document, you are in effect saying, “I understand my roles and responsibilities, and I will adhere to it.” The mere fact that this individual did not sign his parole certificate—none of us were in the room, but some of the anecdotal information was that he was quite agitated when that parole certificate was put in front of him and made it quite clear that he had no intention of signing it. I think the fact that we didn’t know, as individual Ontario residents, that you don’t have to sign it in order to get to the other side of the gate, so to speak, speaks to the transparency that we could do a better job of.", "I just want to say that these are two very basic, very easy fixes. We’re not going to fix the world with this amendment. It’s not going to change the world, but it will be an acknowledgement that we understand that we can do better. I can’t imagine that there is anyone in this chamber who doesn’t believe that we can’t do a better job in the protection of vulnerable citizens, particularly ones who are being targeted by former spouses or individuals they had relationships with.", "Again, I just want to congratulate you. Well done, and really very easily understandable suggestions. The closer we get to December 6 and the national day of remembrance, I think this is an opportunity where we can actually bring forward and say that as legislators, as MPPs, we’re not just going to those ceremonies and taking part in the remembrance; we’re participating in how to make it better.

It’s important to note that I’m unable to speak about any specific incidents or cases, and my remarks should not be taken as such.", "I know that we on this side of the House, and indeed all of us in the House, feel that one of the most important priorities of our government is the safety and security of every Ontarian. I for one, and I know many in this House, welcome the member’s suggestions.

As you well know, this is a package of initiatives to raise awareness of sexual violence and harassment; enhance prevention initiatives to combat sexual discrimination, harassment and violence; and strengthen services and supports for victims.", "In fact, we in this House who are sitting as members of the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment are working very hard right now on our final report writing. We’re hoping to deliver that report to add some more recommendations on this very important subject before the end of this legislative sitting.", "I did want to point out that there already exists a legislated requirement that an inmate be required to sign the certificate of parole unless there are compelling or exceptional circumstances, such as a disability, that could prevent their signing. Indeed, it’s also really important—and I really underscore this point—to note that both probation orders and parole conditions are enforceable, regardless of whether they’ve been signed or not. I want to repeat that: It’s important to note that both probation orders and parole conditions are enforceable, regardless of whether they’ve been signed or not.", "But I also agree that more needs to be done to better understand how this bill can improve the safety and security of our communities.

This bill does make some more recommendations that we’d like to see brought in to protect the victims, and hopefully survivors, of some of the abuse that does go on out there.", "Ensuring that offenders sign their parole certifications and enhanced monitoring of offenders will protect the most vulnerable among us. In cases of sexual violence or domestic violence where the victims are often members of the most vulnerable groups of people, it is necessary that the victims feel safe in their own communities. I often say that no one should fear staying in their own homes. That’s a terrible way to live.", "In rural ridings, we are especially vulnerable because of the geographic distance of not only the homes around us, but police forces and the time of reaction to such instances.", "The case of Mr. Borutski I have spoken to many times in the Legislature—and the tragedies of the women. Unfortunately, he’s not the only case that reveals the need for closer monitoring of offenders in incidences such as what occurred. In 1996, we had Arlene May’s incident, where the offender had a history of criminal convictions that ranged from breach of probation to weapons offence. It was proved that Mr. Iles was a dangerous man. He was released on condition that he leave the jurisdiction within which the victim, Arlene, was residing at that time. Yet the coordinated services didn’t work—record-sharing between police, lack of monitoring. He travelled across the jurisdictions freely and murdered Arlene May.", "These cases have been going on, unfortunately, and we should not tolerate this any further. We need to properly monitor these offenders, especially the high-risk offenders. I’ve mentioned many times in the Legislature about the use of high-risk tools so these people are not released, for example, without signing the conditions of parole or probation. Red flags should go off everywhere. I asked most recently that a system be in place where crown attorneys are notified if a person does not sign those conditions on their release. This has been brought up in Auditors General reports many, many times. The rate of recidivism for high-risk offenders is so high, at 42% to 60%, that we should not be surprised at these numbers.", "The member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke has brought forward a bill that, from the sound of it, the government is supporting or will at least look into it and go to committee.

We are not trying to fix everything, but I do say to the comments, “Would this have prevented those crimes?”, we don’t know that. I agree; we don’t know that.

When there is a good idea that helps Ontarians and grows businesses, we can come together and work together on issues.

Thank you for joining us.", "Many of us have used that phrase, “All politics is local.” The idea for Bill 110 was as a result of meetings that I held in my riding with two local cideries in Dufferin–Caledon: Tom Wilson from Spirit Tree cidery, from their beautiful straw building on Boston Mills Road; and Lindsay and Nick Sutcliffe, from Southern Cliff Brands, known for their Pommies and Farmhouse. This is for you, gentlemen.", "I met them when they were starting their new businesses in Dufferin–Caledon.

Bill 110 will give this industry the support it needs and show that there are people at Queen’s Park who want to see this industry grow.", "I want to highlight an important difference between Ontario craft cider and other ciders sold through the LCBO, and why it’s so important for us to focus on Ontario craft ciders. They only use Ontario-grown fruit, so we’re not just talking about producers; we’re talking about growers, and we should be very proud of this. This is an industry that is supporting other industries across Ontario, including Ontario’s agricultural sector.", "The Ontario Apple Growers know this and therefore are supporting Bill 110. In a letter of support from the Ontario Apple Growers, they state: “The Ontario Apple Growers is providing this letter to voice our full support for Bill 110.”", "They represent 235 commercial apple farmers in Ontario who grow apples for the fresh and processing markets.", "“Each year, the Ontario apple sector grows approximately 294 million pounds of apples, with a considerable volume of apples going to the processing channels.", "“In 2010, as part of the Ontario government’s funding of a 15-year strategy for the tree-fruit industry, developing a robust processing sector for the higher-end and niche segments was identified as a strategic direction. Craft cider definitely falls into this area, and the Ontario Apple Growers are optimistic about the opportunities that are presenting themselves with the growth of the craft cider industry in Ontario. Ontario craft cider companies source the apples they use to make their cider exclusively from members of the OAG.”", "That, of course, is a letter of support from the OAG. Thank you.", "I want to spend a little bit of my time discussing the potential of this exciting industry, which deserves support from all of us.", "Ontario craft cider is indeed rapidly expanding. In 2008, there was only one craft cider producer in all of Ontario. Now there are some 22 cideries across the province. These cideries are located all across Ontario, but it’s important to highlight how important these cideries are to local communities, especially in our province’s rural communities. Not only has the number of cideries rapidly grown in such a short amount of time, but the sales of Ontario craft cider have grown just as quickly.", "From 2009 to 2014, sales grew 284% at the LCBO. That is astounding. Recently, the sales of craft cider at the LCBO nearly doubled, to $4 million. Even though sales of Ontario craft cider are growing exponentially, the majority of cider sold in the LCBO is from outside Ontario and Canada. A very important disadvantage the Ontario craft cider industry faces is the very high markup it pays to the LCBO, whereas, as a comparator, the Ontario Craft Brewers negotiated with the Ministry of Finance to pay a lower tax rate because they produce in such small quantities.", "I want to read out an email I received from a concerned individual who would love to start his own cider business, but explains how detrimental the markup fees are to the Ontario craft cider industry: “The markup fees are detrimental to a small start-up like myself, and having the support of our government behind any start-up is essential for the survival of its first years. The bill will allow us to grow from a start-up to a business that hires, that promotes Ontario products across the country and hopefully parts of the USA, and that is a contributor to Ontario’s revenue.”", "I want to commend this individual for wanting to start his own business. I know it takes courage to start your own business, especially in an industry that is in its infancy. We should be supporting our craft cider industry instead of hindering their growth.", "That is why I brought forward Bill 110, the Growing Ontario’s Craft Cider Industry Act. Bill 110 will ensure that the markup or tax imposed on Ontario cider does not exceed the markup or tax currently in place with Ontario craft beer. Effectively, Ontario craft cider and beer will be placed on an equal footing. Both industries are important to Ontario’s economy, and the Ontario Craft Brewers recognize this.", "In a letter of support from the Ontario Craft Brewers to the Premier, they state, “We are writing today to show our support for the Ontario Craft Cider Association and ask that you join us by backing Bill 110, the Growing Ontario’s Craft Cider Industry Act. Like the craft brewers, Ontario craft cideries strive to produce quality local products. They create jobs in both rural and urban centres, build communities and keep alcohol profits in our province.", "“The OCCA has a commitment to use only 100% Ontario apples and pears that will invest heavily in rural infrastructure. Ontario Craft Brewers share the Ontario Craft Cider Association’s commitment to crafting the highest-quality drinks and making Ontario a continental leader in craft beverages. Our members already invest with the cideries at many events across the province, and we look forward to collaborating with them for many years to come.” That, again, is from the Ontario Craft Brewers.”", "The Ontario craft cider industry has the potential to make a meaningful impact on multiple Ontario industries and to the overall finances of our province, but we will never tap into that potential without first providing the right incentives to this industry. Bill 110 is a start to showing support for this industry. I ask everyone to support this important beginning so that our province can enjoy the fruits of this homegrown industry." ],

I came back to Canada from about a year overseas, and I couldn’t drink Canadian beer because I was so used to good, rich English ales like Old Peculier and others. So when I got back to Canada, I went and started to brew my own beer. More so, I got involved with a group called the Campaign for Real Ale 39 years ago and, within four years, we’d changed the rules in Ontario to allow microbreweries to start up. That was almost 35 years ago. From that humble beginning, where we had Conners and the Feathers, the first brew pub in Ontario, which is in my new riding of Beaches–East York, we have now seen an industry that has grown from about 20 breweries 15 years ago to 150-plus. The big change, if you look—it’s like a hockey stick. They went in a slow growth pattern like this until we changed the markup rules at the LCBO, and then they just took right off and they were able to expand right across this province.", "I see the cider industry in Ontario being very much in the same place as the beer industry was some 10 or 15 years ago, where there’s an opportunity for us to do something very special to allow them to take off with the same kind of profitability that we’re seeing in the craft beer industry. So it’s an extremely important issue.", "I’d also like to thank the member for sharing her time, because I want to point out that I think this is the first time since I’ve been here that I have seen a co-sponsorship of a private member’s bill, and the first time that the lead of the private member’s bill has been shared with a member on the other side of the House. So I praise her for that initiative and praise her for her commitment to that.", "The craft cider industry has three very big asks of our government.", "The first is margin enhancement. What this bill is doing is levelling the playing field between what a can of cider costs at the retailer compared to what a can of craft beer costs. Essentially, it’s about a 25% difference. A can of cider in the liquor store costs you just over $4 and an equivalent-size can of craft beer is about $3. It’s tough for the cider industry to make ends meet on that kind of margin. It’s tough to be competitive. This will change that.", "There’s also a desire to develop a quality control alliance, much like the wine industry have VQA: a cider control alliance where we can promote the fact that this is Ontario apples, Ontario cider and local inputs.", "Finally, increasing the retail distribution of ciders across the province: This is part of the Ed Clark review, obviously, but we’d like to see more ciders in stores, having special shelving sections in the LCBO, being able to market more co-operatively with their fellows in craft beer, and in farmers’ markets. I see a tremendous opportunity that maybe we can include ciders in farm markets where VQA wines are right now.", "Opportunity does knock. Because of our climate, Ontario apples are extremely good for cider production. We need to move forward with that. We have seen, as the member opposite noted, that this is the largest growth section at the LCBO right now, but it’s coming, for the most part, from imports in England and France. We have a chance now to promote local jobs, keep those investment dollars in Ontario, and support the people who are picking and the people who are processing. That’s what this bill will do, and I hope all members will support it." ],

I’d also like to take a moment to thank the member from Dufferin and the member from Beaches–East York for their work in bringing the bill forward.", "Earlier, I had the pleasure to meet with Richard Liu from Sunnybrook Wine, located in beautiful Niagara-on-the-Lake. Sunnybrook is—this is key—an Ontario-owned and -operated company that makes wonderful fruit wines and ciders. A producer of Ontario craft cider, the folks at Sunnybrook are committed to using 100% Ontario-grown apples and pears in their products. They make great products using local produce and creating good local jobs.", "But when I met with them this afternoon, they told me they face a problem when they go to sell that product. Instead of being on a level playing field with the producers of other craft alcohol beverages, they find themselves at the bottom of the hill looking up.", "Why is that the case? What is creating that uneven playing field?", "Currently, craft ciders are categorized as a wine by the LCBO. You can see where the logic in that probably comes from. Ciders are produced from fruit, as are wines, which clearly makes them different from beer or spirits. However, as I’m sure most people are aware, that is about where the similarities between cider and wine end.", "Cider is packaged like beer. It has similar alcohol content to beer and is consumed like beer, although maybe not quite the same amount is drunk. By classifying craft ciders as a wine and not as a beer, or as a distinct product, a problem is created. The problem is that while craft ciders are classified as a wine, they do not enjoy the same financial benefits available to wineries, nor are they eligible for the rebates given to the craft brewers.", "For example, Ontario wineries are eligible for the VQA program. That program allows them to receive a rebate from their sales and is designed, in part, to help Ontario’s wineries grow. It is a great program. You all know there are many wineries in my riding, and I’m happy to see programs that are designed to help them. Craft cider producers, on the other hand, are not eligible for the rebate through the VQA program because that program requires the beverage to be made from grapes.", "I’ll give you another example. When a craft cider producer wants to sell a keg of their cider through the LCBO at a price of $145, they are charged—think about this—a 20% markup. If, however, a craft beer manufacturer wants to sell a keg of their beer, at the same price, through the LCBO, they are not charged any markup at all. I don’t think that makes any sense. You have two kegs—one of cider, one of beer—both very good, both are about the same in alcohol content, both are produced here in Ontario, helping to create local, good-paying jobs, and both will be consumed, hopefully, in a cold pint glass in a responsible manner. Yet the keg of craft cider is going to cost $30 more than the keg of craft beer.", "Despite all of this, cider in Ontario is doing very well, and growing. In 2012-13, cider sales at the LCBO grew by a staggering 76%, after seeing 60% growth in the year prior to that. Unfortunately, most of those sales are not Ontario craft ciders; instead—listen to this because this is important—they are international and Canadian blends or imported ciders.", "Bill 110, the Growing Ontario’s Craft Cider Industry Act, will help to address this uneven playing field that I have just described for you. The bill amends the Liquor Control Act to ensure that the markup or tax on the sale of Ontario craft cider at a government store or at a bar does not exceed the LCBO-imposed markup or tax on the sale of Ontario craft beers. Passing this bill will allow the Ontario craft cider industry to continue to expand and help it in reaching its full potential. The bill is supported, of course, by the Ontario Craft Cider Association, but also by the Ontario Apple Growers and the Ontario Craft Brewers, and I’d like to use my last minute to tell you why.", "Quoting from the craft brewers: “Like the craft brewers, Ontario craft cideries strive to produce quality, local products; they create jobs, both rural and urban, build communities and keep alcohol profits in the province. The OCCA have a commitment to use only”—think about this—“100% Ontario apples and pears and will invest heavily in rural infrastructure.” Clearly, the craft brewers understand that this bill is actually about more than just helping the Ontario craft cider industry. It’s about all of the economic benefits for the rest of the province in doing so.", "For example, I spoke recently in this House about how the Ontario tender-fruit growers and the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation will be planting 130,000 tender-fruit trees in my riding. Those farmers will benefit from the growth in the Ontario craft cider industry because they will have more people making cider than they will have customers for their products.", "Mr. Speaker, Bill 110 is an important piece of legislation for the Ontario craft cider industry, and that’s why they’re here today. It is an important piece of legislation for my riding of Niagara Falls, and it’s an equally important piece of legislation for the entre province. I urge everyone here today to support this bill and to help the Ontario craft cider industry reach its full and very large potential.", "I’d just like to say, because this is a private member’s bill—and I agree that it’s nice to see co-sponsorship—that here is an opportunity where the Conservatives, the Liberals and the NDP are on the same page. We all understand the importance of this industry for the province of Ontario. I say to the Liberals very clearly: You can do this immediately. You have a majority government. You have the support of the Conservatives. You have the support of the NDP. You obviously have the support of the industry. Bring it in with a bill.

But as they will say, when those trees come to fruition, it’s not going to be big enough, so they’re going to depend on our local apple industry. They’re dealing with orchards that are as close as possible to their cider establishment. I can tell you that Northumberland–Quinte West, in those areas—Brighton, for example—was full of apple orchards. We don’t have quite as many, but what’s left are the best in the province. So they are buying local. They’re using local apples. They’re going to be able to use their own apples pretty soon, just down the road.", "This is a success story for a small business in Ontario.

It will also ensure we treat our craft ciders the same we support our craft brewers, levelling the playing field and providing an opportunity for consumers to consume Ontario-grown cider. I think this is good news for not just craft cider producers but also Ontario apple growers.", "Here’s what James McIntosh, who is with us in the audience today, of Duxbury Cider in Meaford said about the importance of passing Bill 110: “Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound is home to the highest concentration of Ontario craft cider makers in the province. This is a great position for Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound and our homegrown industry is making significant strides in the marketplace.

Yes, we make $11 less per case of beer versus a case of cider. Our beer is made from imported ingredients while our cider is made from 100% Thornbury apples.

There was a guy in the Legislature who introduced a bill not so long ago, the Raise a Glass to Ontario Act, that might do that as well.", "(2) We could create jobs in Ontario. What we all want to do is see more jobs created, especially in rural Ontario. We need those jobs.", "Everybody has talked about all the jobs that could be created in apple orchards, in cideries and in manufacturing facilities. If they were just given that level playing field, they could actually create jobs and expand the market faster than it has been expanding already. Ms. Jones, from Dufferin–Caledon, actually alluded to how quickly the industry has been growing. So we want to create jobs in Ontario.", "(3) It’s just the best darned cider out there, and it should be given an opportunity to expand into different markets.", "I know that Mr. Howes has his County Cider in California. They’re selling County Cider in California now. You know what? That’s great. That’s great, but there are a lot of other states that don’t have access to County Cider right now that should. There are all kinds of other countries—and provinces in Canada, for that matter—that should get to experience the great products of Prince Edward county.", "Let’s level the playing field. Let’s create jobs in Ontario. Let’s let the world taste our award-winning cider that we’re producing here in Ontario." ],

It’s long overdue. The tax system hasn’t been fair for this sector for a long, long time. Mr. Howes has been in the industry for 20 years. They call him Grandpa Cider for a reason. It’s time that we gave this sector of our Ontario economy that level playing field so they can compete.", "Everybody in the Legislature, let’s raise a glass to Ontario today and say cheers to Ms. Jones for her private member’s bill.

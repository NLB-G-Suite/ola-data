This government could have done something about this any time in the past 15 years. Yet, just before an election—ironic how that happens with so many pieces of legislation coming forward in the eleventh hour just before an election.", "Premier Wynne did identify this as an issue right away, and the government did a study into the gender wage gap in 2014. But they didn’t do anything with the recommendations until now, as I said, weeks before an election—four years. If they were truly sincere, if they were truly earnest about doing something to shorten the gap, make a difference and bring this up to par, they would have done it before now.", "The Ontario Pay Equity Office has a budget of less than $3 million. This is the lowest in its 30-year history. Again, how much of a priority is it when you make it the lowest in history? There are only about 20 staff in the office, and a number of vacancies, at last count, in the government staff directory—a 20% vacancy rate. So again they talk “priority” and yet they don’t even fill the roles that are there—some of which, frankly, could be the people they want to give this gender equity to.", "It creates the ability for the government to create a pay equity day through regulation. Why not actually create a pay equity day in the legislation? That’s one of the easiest things to do.", "One of the things we see often now is that they’re putting a lot of things into regulation. It actually doesn’t have to come here before you, Mr. Speaker, and before us as the legislators—the democratically elected legislators—to come here and have proper debate. That concerns me in a significant way because we’re seeing more and more of those things. It’s interesting when you think of the title, “transparency,” and yet they’re doing a lot of things that aren’t even coming in front of the Legislature to be properly debated.", "I take, as I’m sure all people in this House do, my responsibility very seriously to bring the views of my constituents—the people that we are democratically elected by—to come here and speak and bring those debate issues out so that we actually develop the best legislation: very clear, concise, good legislation that is actually going to serve all of the people of Ontario, not just a particular partisan need or the whim of a special-interest group. We want to make sure that we have the actual legislation debated properly so that we are moving forward.", "Rather than being a complaints-driven process, this bill allows compliance officers to enter a business without a warrant—something this government seems to like to do. The recent changes to the conservation act also allowed warrantless entry. The government has increased warrantless entry in a number of pieces of legislation.", "Mr. Speaker, again, they continue to assault—it’s almost like they’re against business, and particularly small business, when you see pieces of legislation like this. Yet again they’re doing things without consulting. They’re doing things that we wonder, “Is it really in the best interests of the people of Ontario?”", "When I see things like “compliance officer”: With this government’s record over the last 15 years, what I see is yet another bureaucracy being built where people are coming in as police officers, in the mindset of, “We’re going to find fault with you. We’re going to find concerns and we’re going to fine you,” again putting more burden onto those businesses.", "It really concerns me. I haven’t seen any numbers of how many compliance officers. I’ve seen no data that suggests how much they will spend on compliance officers. I think the people out there that are very concerned about the equity of dollars and value and remuneration would actually like to see that money spent on narrowing the gap in what those salaries are as opposed to spending more and more money on compliance officers, who, again, don’t even need a warrant. They can enter a business without a warrant. It seems to be going the opposite way—and I think all people across the province want to ensure that we actually have the laws that govern all of us and ensure that we’re all treated in that same manner.", "One of the things I hear across Ontario when I travel, whether it be in my critic portfolio or to another riding to get a perspective different from mine—I hear people saying: “We’re not properly consulted. We didn’t see this coming. The government didn’t sit with us and talk about it and make sure we understand it.” Either they go out and hire consultants and bring in a report and then, again, put in regulation—but they very rarely go to the front lines and talk to the people who are going to be most impacted. I’m certainly hearing that from businesses, over and over, as I’m sure you are in your riding, Mr. Speaker—a lot of small businesses in the great riding of Wellington, which you represent.", "The concern that I want to raise with this piece of legislation, again, is, if they’ve had that much time, if they’ve had 14 years to do this, and yet they haven’t actually gone out and done the consultation—they’re doing it at the eleventh hour, I trust, again, as an election ploy, that they’re bringing out a piece of legislation. People haven’t read the details. It sounds good. Why would anyone not want to support something like equity in legislation and remuneration? But at the end of the day, we want to make sure that it serves the people of Ontario properly.", "Kathleen Wynne waited over 26 months—two-plus years—before creating the Gender Wage Gap Strategy Steering Committee in the spring of 2015. If it was truly a big issue, if it was truly a priority, they would have done that as soon as she found out about it. She wouldn’t have had to take that long to even strike a committee. They sat on their hands for two years after receiving the final report from the Gender Wage Gap Strategy Steering Committee in the spring of 2016 before tabling this piece of legislation. Again, Mr. Speaker, if it’s a priority, where was the urgency? Where was the reality of them wanting to do something very quickly?", "For three fifths of the Liberals’ mandate, the last 10 years, the gender pay gap has remained unchanged. Now they’ve put forward this piece of legislation, which deals mostly with tracking outcomes rather than producing tangible results, as part of their cynical election ploy. This comes back to my concern about the compliance officers. If they’re truly doing it—why are we not driving this to show what the tangible results are, as opposed to more stats about how many are in non-compliance and that type of thing?", "In my long-term-care critic role, I’ve found, as I’ve toured the province, a very significant shift. It used to be that the compliance officers would provide guidance. They would be more like a coach. They would go into a facility and meet with the management, and they would say, “Here are the things that you could be doing better.” They’d give them helpful tips. What I’m told is that the whole focus has shifted. Now it’s punitive: “We’re going to find you doing fault, and we’re going to fine you.”", "The government has capped levels of funding for many years to our long-term-care facilities, making it doubly challenging for those operators to provide the proper care to the residents, which should be everyone’s biggest concern. Now they’re coming in and fining them, adding that financial burden to their operation already. If you’re putting more money into paying fines, you’re not putting it back into front-line care, the people who are there, the PSWs and registered nurses and registered practical nurses. All of the facilities are struggling with the challenge to have enough staffing resources. Yet here we’re finding they’re coming in a compliance—and that’s the fear, and I draw the parallel to this piece of legislation, that that compliance officer is going to be punitive. They’re going into businesses looking for fault, as opposed to putting the money that you could be spending—and I think of many of the bureaucracies that they’ve created—the college of skilled trades, the apprenticeship program—what was that one called when they put the new college together? They sent 100 inspectors out there for the college of skilled trades, was it not? They’re going out there fining fines and they’re looking for fault. Rather than finding ways to get more apprentices and more people working, they’re actually going in with that mindset of being very punitive. So I have a very big concern that this is a very similar situation, when I hear “compliance officer.” Why wouldn’t we call it a “compliance coach”?" ],

You’d want to have that dialogue with the employers who drive our economy. If we don’t have employers, if we don’t have businesses, who works out there? Who then pays taxes, if they are not gainfully employed?", "That’s the key that I see as different between the current Liberals’ governing and our governing. We want business to actually be the economic engine, which is where it should be. We shouldn’t be creating every single job within the government and building more bureaucracies, which are very costly. Again, if there’s value, we are fully supportive, but at the end of the day, we have to have a plan to understand what that value is. What is going to be the benefit to the people of Ontario who are paying the taxes on something like this?", "It creates the groundwork for an Equal Pay Day on a specific annual date that will be determined through regulations.

It’s going to happen through consultation,” rather than them ramming things through, like I’ve seen so many times in my years here.", "During Ontario’s Equal Pay Day last year, the 11th of April, 2017, the PC critic on women’s issues reminded the Minister of Labour that the Pay Equity Act was unanimously approved in the Legislature on the 15th of June, 1987. Interesting: Future Premier Mike Harris was the PC spokesperson who called for strong support of the Pay Equity Act in 1987.", "Last spring, the PC caucus suggested the government work with the PCs and the NDP to create a special legislative committee that would sit over the spring and summer of 2017 to bring back to the Legislature—to the Legislature, not through regulation but through the Legislature—amendments to strengthen the Pay Equity Act so the Pay Equity Commission would have updated legislation and the financial resources to close the gender wage gap.", "I think most of the people out there who are feeling that it’s not in the appropriate manner now would rather see money going into the actual pay equity and the ability for them to receive more than going into a whole bunch of compliance officers. Again, I repeat: I have no idea how many they’re going to have. I have no idea how big the structure to support that is. I have no idea how much money they’re going to spend on this bureaucracy to actually do compliance, as opposed to paying people money to narrow that gap.", "Mr. Speaker, a government that can find $25 billion overnight to give a two-year hydro rebate—again, ironically, just before an election—can’t find money to narrow the wage gap. They found $4 billion that they moved off the books to say they balanced the budget, but they haven’t found any money. In this budget, they’re now going to find, through lending sources, $8 billion. I wonder how far $8 billion would have gone to narrow that wage gap.

However, their last meeting was in September 2017. So for something that you would think is a priority for, again, a government that likes to use the word “transparency” in almost every title they use, you would wonder: Why wasn’t something put out in October 2017 to say we’re going to address this? Why wouldn’t it have been totally costed out? They were talking this morning about some other issues, that things weren’t fully costed and weren’t fully detailed. I’d like to suggest to them that it would be nice to see something as important as wage parity and wage equity fully costed out so that the people of Ontario understand, and particularly that those people expecting to be remunerated at that level would certainly be able to be compensated, and we know that the money’s there. They can’t just keep making wild promises, Mr. Speaker, without the reality of who’s going to pay for it.", "We’ve got a new group of pages. Welcome to Queen’s Park. I hope you enjoy your stay here.

Right now, I wonder if any of these pages, in their studies coming here, know that the government of today has agreed to spend $1 billion on interest payments every single month—$1 billion. And that’s at the lowest interest rates we’ve ever had historically, and they continue to dig that debt hole. So by the time you are our age, and even a little before, you’re going to have challenges to be able to pay that.", "What if those interest rates go up and that doubles? That’s one of the fears out there in the economic community, that interest rates will rise. They always cyclically do. What if that doubles? That would mean we’re spending $2 billion a month, Mr. Speaker. Do you think that wage equity gap is going to get narrowed if we start spending that kind of money on interest payments? I do not think so, and I don’t think that the people of Ontario think that either.", "In a nutshell—I just want to review—according to the latest Statistics Canada data, women still earn between 78 cents and 97 cents to every dollar made by a man. The gap between how much women are paid and how much men are paid has only shrunk 10 cents since 1981. Yet this government again says over and over, “This is our priority.” It’s their priority because there’s an election coming on June 7. That’s why it is a priority, and I think they would all agree to that, although they probably won’t nod yes when I look across the aisle right now.", "So, for 15 years, Mr. Speaker—15 years—this government, which again in the headlines says, “This is a priority and we want”—" ],

Will people in another four years be able to say, “Yes, it actually made the difference. It actually did get done”?", "If we look at their track record, we were going to build a gas plant for $1.2 billion, but we didn’t ever build that gas plant, Mr. Speaker. They said they were going to have an eHealth system, and $8 billion later there was no eHealth system. They didn’t say they were actually going to sell Hydro One, a net revenue source for the province. They didn’t say that at all before the last election but, ironically, they came out and also said, “With that sale we will balance the debt.” Now, just in this House a couple of weeks ago, we talked about the budget, and they’re now suggesting that for six years we’re going to be in a deficit situation again, although in the previous budget they said, “We’re going to balance for a number of years into the future.”", "Mr. Speaker, I’m sorry to sound cynical, but that’s what the people in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound and across the province are referring back to me, saying, “You need to hold them accountable.

So let’s consider the record on accountability and transparency: $8 billion in eHealth; $1.1 billion for cancelling gas plants; $2 billion on smart meters that I haven’t heard one person in Ontario yet tell me they feel they’re smart meters; a $4.5-million salary for the CEO of Hydro One, and I believe that just went up. In fact, they gave him a raise just two weeks ago of $1.7 million extra, so he now makes $6.2 million. The Minister of Energy said today, “That’s because he’s doing such a wonderful job and he has numbers to account”—well, I hope that it’s 20 times better than it was if he’s getting 20 times more than the Quebec CEO or the BC CEO." ],

I’m not certain if they ever campaigned suggesting they were going to do that. I wonder how each of them, when they speak about coal plants, actually can stand here and not actually feel that they’re not being transparent and saying, “Oh, by the way, we bought a coal plant with your money.” I haven’t heard one of them agree and admit to that, Mr. Speaker.", "Let’s not forget that they have tripled the debt, to $325 billion. So, back again to the pages in front of you, every single child in this country is born with $22,000 of debt, and that’s only getting higher. They’ve added another $8 billion in deficit this year. Those dollars could be going to all kinds of things like wage equity. They could be going to long-term care, they could be going to hospitals; they could be going to the less fortunate; and those in social and community services.", "So I find it very interesting when we talk about pay transparency. Tell us how much you’ve set aside in the budget. Tell us when it will be done. Put it in black and white that if you do not achieve that goal, if you do not do it—because you haven’t in the last 15 years, even though you’ve said it’s a priority. In this election, I hope at least you’ll be honest with the people of Ontario. You’ll put in black and white how much you’re budgeting, when it will be done, and if you don’t do it, then you will all resign because you were not transparent on something that you, again, are suggesting is absolutely a priority for your government—absolutely a priority—two months before the next election.", "Let’s not forget what they’ve done for the last 15 years in regard to wage equity and truly making a difference in people’s paycheques. They’ve done absolutely zero, Mr. Speaker. At the end of the day, that’s unfortunate." ],

Certainly, when the Conservatives were in office here in this province, they did not apparently believe that enforcing the Pay Equity Act was very important because, 10 years after the passage of that bill, the Conservatives reduced in half the budget for the Pay Equity Commission, from $6 million to $3 million. That legacy, that cut that was put in place in 1997, has continued all of these years under this Liberal government. So I do agree with him that the Liberal government’s new-found commitment to addressing the gender wage gap is highly questionable when you look at that history of funding decisions absolutely flat-lining the budget of the Pay Equity Commission.", "Speaker, we have to remember that pay transparency really is an enforcement tool to be able to know how well the Pay Equity Act is working. The problem with the legislation we have before us is that it applies to a sliver of the employees who are bound by pay equity legislation. The current Pay Equity Act applies to all employers in this province with more than 10 employees. This pay transparency bill will apply, at some point in the future, to public sector employees; and then, at some other indeterminate time in the future, may apply to employees who are at firms with more than 500 employees; and then, at some even more distant time in the future, may apply to firms with 250 or more employees.", "This act will not achieve what it is supposed to do if it doesn’t apply to every employer in this province, as the Pay Equity Act does." ],

In fact, if you look at Ontario on average, the gender wage gap is about 30% and has remained largely unchanged over the last decade.", "The Pay Equity Act is in place and it has applied. So you ask yourself: What are some other actions that we could take? In fact, the member opposite for Owen Sound asked, “What are you going to do about that?” Well, in the budget we actually did announce something that will be very helpful, which is the making available of free child care for all children from two and a half years of age up until junior kindergarten age, because that will help women get back into the workforce sooner and actually will be very helpful.", "But the other thing that this particular act does is that, if passed, it would require that all public job postings include salary ranges, bar employers from asking applicants about their past compensation and would also eventually require certain employers to record, report and post compensation data that includes gender and other diversity characteristics.", "For people who work in the Ontario public sector, we already post salaries, at least for those over $100,000.

I’m going to start off by saying that, reading through this bill, one could only come to the conclusion that this bill is defective and that it is full of ambiguities and lacks any definition. I would also say that it relies too heavily upon an inappropriate delegation of authorities.", "Let me give a few examples, Speaker, of the defective qualities of this bill. It does not define what an offence is under this bill. It speaks in generic terms that there can be offences, but it doesn’t define what an offence is. Then, furthermore, to add to that defective element, it also doesn’t prescribe what the penalty is for the offence where we don’t know what is an offence. I have never seen a bill where we’re being asked to vote on something that only gives the ministry the determination of what an offence is and what the penalty would be.", "We don’t even know in this bill which employers will be subject to the provisions of the bill. We have no idea if it will be all employers, some employers, public service employers. It is full of generalities with no definition. It also fails to disclose what other criteria beyond gender may be subject to the provisions of Bill 3. How could we possibly look at this bill and not see that it is just a totally defective bill—much like this government." ],

This has existed for the whole time and, a couple of weeks before an election, it becomes a priority. It’s really hard to swallow; it’s really hard to believe.", "To make matters even more hard to swallow, it will start with the public service. To say that we want to publicly show the salary of the public service—Speaker, you can go on the website right now, click on their collective agreement and know exactly how much people are making. All you have to do is see what job classifications they are in. We already have this. If they make over $100,000, their names are on the sunshine list.", "So it seems like what the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound was saying is that it is lacking a lot before it becomes believable that this could have been a priority. If this was really a priority, it would apply—like everything else under the Pay Equity Act—to every employer with 10 employees or more.

I am also very appreciative of the work of my colleague the member from London West, who is a tremendous advocate for fairness and women’s rights. She holds this government to account every day as our women’s issues critic, and spent her one-hour lead giving them excellent examples of how to ensure this bill accomplishes what it needs to. As much faith as I have in her, I don’t have in this government, but here’s another chance for the folks on the other side to challenge their government’s halfway approaches. I’m pleased to offer my two cents on this bill.", "Tomorrow, April 10, 2018, is Equal Pay Day. What does that mean? Does it mean everyone gets paid equally tomorrow? Nope. Does it mean that people are paid equal to what they are worth? Nope. Equal Pay Day marks the day when women have finally earned as much as men, have finally caught up, and it means that, on average, women must work 15 and a half months to make what men do in 12. It takes us an additional three and a half months for women to catch up in Canada.", "What is pay equity? Why do we care? What is the gender pay gap? What is pay transparency? Well, I’m pleased to have the opportunity to break it down for the folks at home. This is not another pay equity bill. The Pay Equity Act guarantees equal pay for work of equal value. Jobs that are of equal value in terms of the skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions must be compensated equally, regardless of whether men or women are doing the work. Jobs that are done predominantly by women must be paid equally to comparably valuable work done predominantly by men. Fair is fair.", "Also, the Human Rights Code protects workers from discrimination in all aspects of employment. It guarantees that women are entitled to equal treatment without discrimination. When it comes to workplace discrimination affecting pay levels, employment status or designed gendered boundaries and systemic discrimination that limits access to jobs, compensation, training or opportunities, we turn to the Human Rights Code.", "I’ll get to the pay transparency part of this conversation in a second, but continuing to explain the legal framework for protections that we have for women and we have for workers, let’s look to the Employment Standards Act, which establishes the right to equal pay for equal work, with distinction based on sex. Recently, this right was extended to part-time, casual and seasonal workers, and to temp employees doing basically the same work as directly hired employees.", "Those are the basics that are laid out in law, which brings us back to pay transparency. Pay transparency is a tool that can help to promote pay equity. Pay transparency means that companies share broad information about who gets paid what. Some of what they have to report are what are the salary ranges per job classification, broken down by gender, and what are average salaries by gender per job classification. This allows people who are generally underpaid—for example, women, racialized workers and people with disabilities—to be in better bargaining positions for salary.", "Pay transparency law also protects employees from having to disclose their previous salaries, again putting them in a better bargaining position, and protects employees as they may or may not choose to discuss salaries with one another. The idea is that exposing an employment setting’s gender wage gap will also help to empower workers and encourage employers to close that gap.", "Speaker, I have, in easy terms, a bit about what pay transparency is and is not, from PayScale.com, and I’d like to read directly:", "“Being more transparent about pay doesn’t have to mean posting everyone’s salary for all to see, though there are some companies that go that far. What it does mean is employees having an understanding of their company’s compensation philosophy, strategies and practices. What labour market is the company competing in for talent?... Is the company aiming to meet or exceed the competition when it comes to pay?... What is the range for your position at your company and where do you fall within it? How are raises determined/awarded?", "“There are different levels of transparency and each company is going to fall somewhere along a spectrum, but pressure is definitely building for companies to become more transparent with employees about pay....”", "Why does transparency matter?", "“First, it can help ensure that workers are being paid equitably for equal work. If there are fewer secrets surrounding salaries, it becomes much harder for any pay inequities to arise. That’s better for workers in terms of fairness, and it protects employers....", "“Second, it builds trust. When employees feel valued, and aren’t spending cycles thinking about whether they might be underpaid, they’re more likely to be more fully engaged in their work....", "“Companies that are truly committed to retaining and supporting their ... employees are going to move in the direction of more transparency.”", "Here at this Legislature, we have some transparency when it comes to what folks make. It’s public record. I make the same amount as my colleagues on this side of the House. Nearly all of the government members earn more, but that is not gender-based, and regardless of what I think of it, it’s public and it’s trackable—which brings us to this bill, Speaker. We don’t have pay transparency in our workplaces.", "An interesting anecdote: A few days ago, I hosted a number of families at my office to talk about the mess that is the Passport system, the tangled system the government is using to distribute funds to families with adult children with developmental disabilities. I have no idea how the system works. Interestingly, neither do the workers in the developmental services sector and neither do the families.", "Anyway, during the conversation, the families were sharing their stories and trying to help each other make sense of things, realizing that when it comes to money and entitlements, the government won’t tell you anything. They make you figure it out on your own. You don’t know what you’re entitled to, you don’t know what a fair amount is, you don’t know how things are decided, and you don’t know what any other families or children are getting. One father at this meeting, John, noted that it’s like at work: You have no way of knowing what anyone else is making, so you don’t know what you should be making or could be making. You don’t know what’s fair.", "Well, Speaker, that’s what we have here. Many employers don’t want folks to know what others are making. In fact, they often penalize or punish anyone for asking, or for sharing their super-secret wage information.", "This bill is called the Pay Transparency Act. It pretends to be taking this on, but it is weak and it misses opportunities, which is very Liberal of this proposed legislation. Also very Liberal is to do things halfway, or to not do things at all and say that they are.", "Case in point: This government has announced that pay transparency will apply to the Ontario public service and later, after extensive—read “lengthy”—consultation—read “dawdling”—will be extended to employers with 500 or more employees, and later—whenever, maybe—to employers with 250 or more employees.", "Well, (a) this undercuts the existing obligations in the Human Rights Code, Employment Standards Act and Pay Equity Act, and (b) the Ontario public service workers are unionized, which means, as we’ve already heard, that employees are paid according to collective agreements, without secret wages. The workers already know what they are making, supposed to make, entitled to make and will make. That’s the beauty of a collective agreement. There isn’t a wage chart for men and a different one for women. There are grids for seniority and job categories, for example.", "As a teacher, if I knew what year of a grid someone was on, then I knew what they made, and also, I knew that I was being remunerated what I was entitled to—well, until this government opened up the contracts and stole our sick leave and attacked our benefits. I forgot how awful this government has been. But if they hadn’t actually kicked educators in the teeth with Bill 115, I never would have gotten involved with politics, so there is that. But I digress.", "The Equal Pay Coalition does great advocacy work, and I have appreciated reading their submission called Strengthening Ontario’s Pay Transparency Bill. I hope the government is familiar with it, but I’d like to read some of it to them, just in case they’re paying attention.", "According to the Ontario Equal Pay Coalition, “Pay transparency is an important enforcement tool used to buttress the existing human rights laws to help close the gender pay gap. Pay transparency promotes compliance by creating accountability for non-discriminatory pay.", "“Women have the fundamental human right to be free from systemic sex discrimination in pay. A ‘right’ is just that—it is a legal entitlement that must be enforced. It is not a privilege. It is not an option. It is a baseline entitlement for every woman in the workplace.", "“All employers in the province have had a legal obligation to deliver discrimination-free pay since the 1960s. But employers continue to flout the law.", "“As reported by Ontario’s Pay Equity Office, 54% of employers have gender pay gaps contrary to the Pay Equity Act even though pay equity has been the law since 1987.”", "Side note, not in their submission: In 1987, I was nine, so it’s getting to be a little while ago, Speaker.", "But back to this: “In 2016 the provincial Gender Wage Gap Steering Committee reported that the pay gap has not closed in 30 years.", "“In its March 2018 Women’s Economic Empowerment Strategy, the government acknowledged that ‘The gender wage gap in Ontario has remained stagnant for the last decade, with women earning around 30 per cent less than men.’ Canada’s gender pay gap is the 7th largest out of the 34 countries in the OECD.”", "I’m going to continue, since they’re still here and hopefully listening.", "“At present, non-unionized workers do not know the pay structure in their workplaces. They can be disciplined and even terminated for asking about or sharing wage information. Yet, provincial laws require individual workers to file individual complaints to enforce their rights to discrimination-free pay. That right cannot be enforced ... if women don’t know their employer’s pay structure.", "“Pay transparency remedies this defect.", "“Pay transparency puts the onus on employers to disclose their wages to prove that they are complying with their existing legal obligations under Ontario’s Human Rights Code, Employment Standards Act, and Pay Equity Act.", "“Pay transparency in the form of mandatory disclosure of compensation information enables workers, particularly non-unionized workers, to know and enforce their right to non-discriminatory pay.”", "This is the re-introduced Bill 203. It has been newly numbered Bill 3—it’s post-prorogation Bill 3—but it isn’t what it needs to be to actually remedy the situation and deliver meaningful change.", "Still from the Equal Pay Coalition: “Bill 3 is essentially unchanged from Bill 203. The act needs amendments if it is to deliver meaningful change. The Equal Pay Coalition calls on the Ontario government to strengthen the Pay Transparency Act to ensure that it makes an advance in securing robust, effective protection for women’s human rights.", "“The bill has left too much to be introduced through regulations to be designed by the Minister of Labour. Leaving key obligations to regulations undercuts the strength of the act and creates a democratic transparency deficit by cloaking key elements of the act to private consultations.”", "Speaker, we’ve just heard that there are some key priorities that need to be changed so that this bill accomplishes more than it does in its current state. How this bill can be applied is currently left to regulations. It always makes me nervous, when it’s with this government, leaving everything to chance when we leave it to regulations.", "It initially applies to the OPS, and then to large and then medium employers with 250 or more employees, but this act should apply to all employees wherever we find them—public or private sector, and small employers—to match the obligations under the Pay Equity Act.", "Additionally, the government contracts should comply with equality rights, mandatory timelines need to exist to file annual transparency reports with the Ministry of Labour and we need to require employers to deliver annual transparency reports to corporate shareholders, clearly set out what information should be in the transparency reports, including compensation structure and wage grids by gender, job classification and job status—like full-time, part-time, casual, seasonal and temporary—and include a clear purpose clause in the legislation.", "This bill doesn’t have any specifics, as I just mentioned, about the reporting and about what those reports will involve or what would be disclosed in those pay transparency reports. Why on earth would we leave those specifics to regulation? Put it in the act.", "Speaker, I’m not a cynical person by nature, but after four years of sitting across from this Liberal government I think I’m a bit cynical by nurture. This proposed legislation is facing down an election and it’s missing a lot of its potential. I think it isn’t a giant step forward for women, even though its title might make you think otherwise. But we have learned, time and time again about this government and their use of great titles. I think that something that is clear here is that everyone in Ontario can see right through this government, so there’s a little bit of transparency there, I guess.", "The proposed legislation doesn’t even match the current obligations under the Ontario Pay Equity Act or even the planned federal legislation. Both of those apply to public and private sector employers with 10 employees or more. This Liberal version applies only to the public sector and, after much foot-dragging and consultations—or, as I said, dawdling—will eventually, hopefully, apply to employers with more than 250 employers. Ninety-five per cent of all employers in Ontario are small businesses and, according to the Ministry of Labour, they employ 28% of Ontario’s workers. As Fay Faraday of the Ontario Equal Pay Coalition has publicly stated, “One hundred per cent of employers have an obligation to provide equal pay. The Human Rights Code doesn’t carve out anybody. So there is no principle justification for restricting pay transparency.”", "This government hasn’t even been able to ensure pay equity within the government after 15 years as the government. This Premier has refused to restore funding to the Pay Equity Commission. And since the Pay Equity Commission had its funding cut in half in 1997 by the last Conservative government, I don’t hold out any hope that the Conservatives wannabes would remedy that or even be interested in paying women fairly for their work. Just a hunch.", "Ontarians have to stop choosing between bad and worse when it comes to women’s rights and opportunities. We need to see a properly resourced Pay Equity Commission. We want to ensure that more women in the public service move into leadership roles. We want to immediately implement the equal pay coalition’s 12 recommendations to close the gender pay gap.", "Women who do the work deserve the pay—equal pay, dollar for dollar, workplace by workplace. Speaker, I’d encourage you and all members of the House to not forget that April 10 is Equal Pay Day. Wear red and stand up for fairness and what’s equal and what is right under existing human rights and pay equity laws.", "We challenge the shortcomings of this proposed legislation. We want to see meaningful pay transparency in this province. We support closing the gender pay gap—not one timid Liberal step forward at a time, but with all Ontarians marching forward together to ensure that every woman and every worker is valued fairly and paid what they’re worth." ],

Just from previous experience with compliance officers on other laws this government has brought forward, it seems to be a confrontational thing.

This is what I’ve heard from some of the businesses in my area. Years ago, they used to try to work with people.

I think this is a very important debate we’re having in this Legislature on Bill 3, but, through Bill 3, on an important issue around the gender wage gap, around issues around pay equity, and, of course, not only the empowerment of women but the role of women in our economy. Our economy is only going to be stronger if there’s full participation by women in that economy.", "I want to pick up where the member from Oshawa left off. I agree with her that this is not a new problem. This is a problem that has existed for some time, but I think the fact that we’re still dealing with the problem tells us that this is quite a persistent problem. Different things have been tried at different times—things like pay equity legislation—but we are finding that there’s still a wage gap. There is still a wage gap as it relates to the lines of gender, as it relates to women, especially women who have disabilities. The task for us, of course, as legislators, is always to keep on top of these issues, to always make sure that we are not being complicit. Of course, we will try different things—and governments of all stripes have tried things, both at the federal and provincial levels—but if they’re not working or if they’re not taking us all the way we want, where women and men are paid equally, where women and men are given the same opportunities to do the same kind of work, then we need to take those very important steps to address those issues. That’s why the Pay Transparency Act is an important piece of legislation, because it is taking that next step in Ontario to deal with issues around the gender wage gap.", "Speaker, we’ve heard, I’m sure, from other members that this is part of Then Now Next: Ontario’s Strategy for Women’s Economic Empowerment. It’s a first-of-its-kind strategy that is working to reduce barriers and help women succeed in any path they choose. Other countries have done different things, and of course we learn from that, good or bad, but we need to make sure that we are taking steps here in our province.", "This legislation, if passed, would require all public job postings to include salary ranges and would bar employers from asking applicants about their past compensation. It would also eventually require certain employers to record, report and post compensation data that includes gender and other diversity characteristics. This may, on its face, seem straightforward or simple, but in my view it’s quite powerful. What we’re talking about is something that I feel very strongly about: data collection. It is to make sure that we’ve got enough data and that that data, that information, is made publicly available so that you and I and our citizens can make a determination on what the information is, what that information means; and that if there are deficiencies that are identified or highlighted as a result of the information before us, we can take certain steps.", "That’s exactly, in my view, Speaker, what we’re doing here today through this important piece of legislation: making sure that we are making public job postings with compensation so that everybody knows exactly what the compensation associated with that job is—not what people are getting paid, whether they are men or women. Of course, requiring the data based on gender and diversity characteristics allows for that additional layer that we need to put in place.", "I just feel that this is an important, progressive step that the government is taking. I am confident that when we are speaking around issues of pay equity and the gender wage gap, this House—the House that I know and the House that I work at—will deem this as a non-partisan issue, because it is talking about 50% of our population and making sure that they are at the same level as everybody else in our province.", "I also feel strongly that this strategy and this piece of legislation build very firmly on the work the government is doing when it comes to precarious employment, when it comes to the working conditions of people who are working in part-time, casual or seasonal work. We know the data demonstrate that most of the people who work in those precarious work environments are women or are racialized. These tend to be entry-level jobs, where somehow people are paid less for the same kind of work that they may be doing if somebody was employed in a full-time position. Through Bill 148, the legislation that we brought and passed in this House, we have taken steps to ensure that we have equal pay for equal work—again, a very straightforward, simple concept, but a powerful one, because it doesn’t exist.", "When it comes to part-time workers, casual workers and seasonal workers, it is important, given the fact that we know that most of them are women or racialized Ontarians, that you’ve got equal pay for equal work—not to mention bringing in a living wage of $15 an hour, which is another very important and powerful step to ensure that the floor is much higher when it comes to employment and equality. Again, it would help those individuals who work on those jobs that tend to pay minimum wage to get a fair wage—a wage that will ensure for them to be able to live a decent or a better-quality life.", "I look at this legislation in combination with the suite of things that have been done by this government, and Bill 148 is front and centre in that. I think that if you combine all that, you see that we are taking a very concerted step, a focused approach to dealing with issues around precarity of employment. We’re taking on issues around the gender wage gap and we’re taking steps around pay equity as it relates to women in particular and other underrepresented groups.", "Once again, I urge all members to support this important bill. In my community of Ottawa Centre, I work with women’s groups all the time, and groups who are working around eliminating inequities in our workforce and our work environment. This is one of the issues that comes up often, that we still live in a time and a place where the gender wage gap exists. This legislation, in my community of Ottawa Centre, is very well received.", "The question is asked: How come we have not done this before? It’s a fair question. The fact of the matter is that we’re taking a concerted effort in terms of the work that we’re doing around equal pay for equal work, the work we’re doing around a living wage and also legislation such as pay transparency that we’re debating today. All of that stitched together is going to result in meaningful steps, a meaningful manner in which we can ensure that everyone in our society is getting paid the same and has the same opportunities to succeed." ],

One of the frustrations that I have shared in this Legislature during my lead on this bill is around this Liberal government’s lack of connecting the dots. They have their women’s empowerment strategy, they have their gender-based violence strategy, but nowhere do they acknowledge that women’s lower wages—30% lower—make them much more vulnerable to sexual harassment in the workplace, and sexual harassment in the workplace makes them six and a half times more likely to leave their employment. So there is this vicious circle that is created because of the intersection of lower wages for women and women’s vulnerability to sexual harassment.", "We need to do a much better job in this #MeToo moment that we are having globally. We need to do a much better job of ensuring that sexual harassment in the workplace is eradicated. That in itself would go a long way to closing the gender wage gap. I have to say that in 15 years of this Liberal government, we have seen no movement on closing that gap. That gap has remained stubbornly stuck at about 30%. Now, in the weeks before an election is about to take place in this province, we finally see some sort of lukewarm legislation brought forward to try to close that gap.", "Speaker, we need to have a much broader, much more coherent strategy if we are to be able to do anything to effectively close that gap.

Research shows that besides increasing women’s economic security and creating more equitable workplaces, eliminating the wage gap would benefit the entire economy and individual businesses. A recent study by McKinsey and Co. suggests that if women were fully engaged in the economy, it would add $60 billion to Ontario’s GDP by 2026. That’s $60 billion. By closing the gender wage gap, the provinces could add between 4% and 9% to their GDP. Royal Bank of Canada estimated that personal incomes in Canada would increase by $168 million annually if women had the same labour force opportunities as men. So it adds to the competitiveness of our businesses.", "Research also shows that workplaces that establish gender equity are more likely to have a competitive advantage, attract highly skilled workers, reduce employee turnover and demonstrate better organizational and financial performance.", "Mr. Speaker, this is not only the right thing to do for women; it is the right thing to do for the province of Ontario." ],

Why didn’t they get it done in the two previous elections, when they’ve been aware of it that long?

Why wasn’t there transparency over the last 15 years, telling people what was going to happen and when? I use my example again of long-term-care homes.

But when we brought it to the issue, when we really brought it to the fore this year, they found money.", "This one strikes me as a very similar thing. We’re getting close to an election.

It’s difficult to debate and delve into a bill like this when we’re just given the bare bones. We’ve seen a lot of these types of skeleton bills over the last few years, bills that hand off powers to ministers or to the cabinet. We’re leaving all of the substance to be determined at a later date by regulation, at the pleasure of the individual minister. It’s a real shame, because it’s not a transparent process and it really undermines the work that we do here as elected representatives.

Much of that money is spent with no public application process or criteria. Instead, the minister and the Premier hand-pick the companies that would receive the payouts behind closed doors by invitation only. They hand out grants to select companies that are, in effect, funded by the taxes paid by their competitors.

Furthermore, the AG found that 96% of these economic development funds went to the oldest and biggest companies, and the government didn’t bother to track outcomes from these programs, so there was no way to measure or verify that the money was accomplishing anything at all.", "My point here is that we have already seen too much evidence that this government is not actually concerned with outcomes or even the real impact of their policies, which have consistently taken a back seat to PR and virtue signalling.

Birmingham council was successfully sued for rewarding male-dominated work like street-sweeping more generously than female-dominated work like cleaning.

Politicians, courts and bureaucrats are ill-placed to compare jobs from afar, let alone to set pay.”", "I think the article raises an interesting point. Many jobs today are difficult to compare.

Mean gaps can be skewed by a few high-earners, as shown by the fact that nine of the 10 organizations with the greatest differences between their median and mean pay-gaps are football clubs.”", "This is a reference to the comparison of the wages of Premier League football players to the women in those organizations who are in the accounting department or are working the turnstiles, which is obviously a ridiculous comparison that arises from some instances of these surveys but which can nonetheless result in some very bad PR. It’s a pitfall we need to be aware of.", "This article in the Economist goes on:", "“All this leaves plenty of room for spin, misinterpretation and counterproductive responses. Two narratives have emerged. The first is that the gaps prove how sexist and discriminatory the workplace still is. The second is that they are adequately explained by men’s greater share of senior jobs, and have nothing to do with discrimination. Neither is quite right.”", "Again, Speaker, it’s coming back to the interpretation of data, and distinguishing between pay discrimination and representation issues.", "The article then delves further into different schemes for pay transparency, but from these concludes, “They should beware quick fixes. Companies could outsource low-paid administrative work, which would improve their figures overnight. They could also stop hiring junior women, who exacerbate gaps in the short term. Voluntary pay cuts by the best-paid men—as taken recently by some BBC stars—may be good PR, but they can create backlashes, as in Iceland a few years ago when some men’s salaries were cut after equal pay claims by women.", "“Many of the more sensible solutions take time and start with diagnosing what lies behind the numbers. ‘I’m concerned that this British reporting is ostensibly focused on pay, but in reality it’s just about representation,’ says Brian Levine of Mercer, a consultancy. ‘What companies really need to find out is whether they are hiring equitably, paying equitably and are offering equitable opportunities to advance.’", "“Men’s and women’s salaries start diverging from the childbearing years. This ‘motherhood penalty’ is often followed by the ‘good-daughter penalty,’ when elderly parents require care and daughters prove more conscientious than sons. The median pay gap is only 2% among full-time workers in their thirties, yet jumps to 14% in their forties and 16% in their fifties, according to the Office for National Statistics....", "“Unlike Britain, many European countries tackling pay gaps have focused on discrimination between people with similar jobs, rather than gaps across whole companies. Nevertheless, Britain’s blunter exercise is having an impact. The data have got board members, shareholders, customers and employees talking about pay. Now that the numbers are out, executives are keen to ‘win,’ says one consultant. Iris Bohnet, an economist at Harvard University, has noted a similar effect caused by awarding hygiene ratings to restaurants and putting energy-efficiency labels on white goods.", "“If women’s positions do improve, it will be hard to say whether it was caused by mandatory reporting or broader winds of change. In America, where” the President “has rejected a similar policy, companies nevertheless increasingly publish data on pay equality, often under pressure from shareholders. In Britain several accounting and law firms disclosed partners’ salaries, though they were excluded from mandatory reporting.", "“And within companies the case for diversity is increasingly made not in terms of PR but profit, as evidence linking diversity to performance mounts. McKinsey found that companies in the bottom quartile for gender and ethnic diversity in leadership were 29% less likely to achieve above-average profitability.", "“Even if every company became scrupulously fair, the pay gap would endure as long as more women than men worked part-time and in industries that pay poorly. This prompts a question that is often overlooked: What size should the gap be? Theresa May this week said she wanted her government to end the ‘burning injustice’ of the gender pay gap. The injustice to aim at is not the lack of equality in outcomes, but rather in opportunities.”", "That was taken verbatim from an Economist article, as I mentioned at the beginning.", "We have to make sure that we don’t offer incentives for the type of unscrupulous quick fixes that the article mentions—like outsourcing low-paid work done predominantly by women or minorities, or not hiring from these demographics for junior positions—which would help a company to appear more fair, statistically speaking, but which would have adverse consequences for the very people we’re trying to help.", "What this article is really getting at, Speaker, is that this is a complex, multi-layered issue that needs to be addressed thoughtfully and responsibly. It’s an issue that is open to political exploitation, which can lead to the use of blunt-instrument approaches and short-sighted policies. I worry that that’s what we see from this government, which hasn’t demonstrated the level of commitment to this issue which most might assume, based on the rhetoric they use. I have yet to hear a good explanation for why funding for the Pay Equity Office is currently at the lowest level it has been in its 30-year history, for example.", "I understand that with the election looming, the government is moving to correct that with a 25% increase to the commission’s funding. It’s amazing how motivated this government has become on this all of a sudden. After 15 years of being in power, many of those years in majority government, free to bring forward these types of changes at any time, all of a sudden in the run-up up to an election they discover this will to act.", "Speaker, it’s really a shame that the people of this province are basically having to cross their fingers and hope that their own issues and interests happen to coincide with the best interests of this government. Unfortunately, even when they do and you’re lucky enough to have this government put something in motion, you’re still ending up with this jerry-rigged policy that isn’t that all that definitive or thorough. It’s either half-baked or flimsy, propped up with promises of more to come at a later date.", "You know, Speaker, that same budget that says it will deliver more funds to the commission—that budget itself showed job projections for the future have been cut in half, from 128,000 new jobs this year to only 60,000 jobs by 2021. It also projects $1 billion less in corporate revenues yearly, moving forward. I would like to say that it’s important we address equal opportunity. It’s also important that we address opportunity for all. We know there is a deficit of women and new Canadians in senior roles, in those higher-paying jobs, and part of the solution needs to be making sure that those good opportunities exist for those under-represented people to be able to pursue.", "Speaker, I’ve heard from a lot of companies across Ontario that are struggling to attract and retain talent. They’re having a difficult time finding qualified people for the jobs that need to be filled. The skills gap is something that our party has raised over and over again as an issue that needs to be addressed, so I think it’s also important that as we discuss compliance and quotas and so on, we make sure we don’t inadvertently punish or shame the good actors: the companies that are fair and equitable, but which are facing very real obstacles in the hiring process.", "This bill doesn’t stand alone, Speaker. It’s coming into force alongside labour changes in Bill 148 and other legislation. All at once, the government is involving itself in the day-to-day operation of businesses in a pretty unprecedented way, so we need to be very mindful, as we move forward, about the impact this is having. We need to keep a close eye on what really results from these changes and whether the measures actually prove to be effective and constructive when they’re implemented.", "We also need to make sure we aren’t creating more unnecessary red tape. This bill will be working in concert with other pay equity legislation, including the Pay Equity Act and the Fair Workplaces, Better Workplaces Act’s amendments to the ESA. Will this create the need for duplicate reporting? The reporting structure isn’t clear. This government has already handed down a pretty significant financial and administrative burden to employers, so I hope this bill won’t add additional red tape.", "The bottom line is that I think we could have done a lot better with this bill. I think it’s deeply unfortunate that the Liberals have sat on their hands for 15 years and are now just pushing through a skeletal bill because we have an election coming in 60 days." ],

For example, if someone is working in a kitchen in a correctional facility through the ministry, are they making more money, have they got a better deal, let alone a pension, compared to somebody working in a kitchen in the private sector?

Thank you to my colleagues for that wonderful ovation.", "As always, it is an honour to rise in this House on behalf of my constituents of Essex and our party—the New Democratic Party—our leader, Andrea Horwath, and the people of this province. The bill is Bill 6, the Correctional Services Transformation Act, 2018. From the outset, on the surface of this act, I’ll let my colleagues know that New Democrats support the thrust of the act, and we most definitely accept the need for an overhaul in corrections in Ontario.", "Why can I state that categorically at this moment, at the beginning of my one-hour lead? It is because, unequivocally, the state of our corrections system and our probation and parole system in Ontario is in crisis. I want to thank all of the front-line corrections and community safety and probation and parole officers who work in our communities day in and day out for not only the work that they do in keeping us safe and enforcing the rule of law, but also for bringing attention day after day, relentlessly, to this House and its elected members about the crisis that exists in corrections.", "I will give a shout-out to just a few of those whom I’ve leaned on quite heavily to gather information and to learn more about the crisis and about some of the remedies: first, Smokey Thomas, president of OPSEU; Chris Jackel; Randy Simpraga; my friends Jack Bene and Sarah Bene—Jack is a corrections officer; Sarah is a probation and parole officer—and Danielle Du Sablon, who is a probation and parole officer.", "They are dedicated to the work that they do. They are dedicated to providing safety and security for our communities and also for the people whom they are trusted to guard. As guardians and as custodians of those who are in the system, they are the closest to the issues. If I can quote Chris Jackel from a couple of weeks ago, when he joined Smokey Thomas in their press conference here at Queen’s Park: “Those closest to the problem are closest to the solution.” That means listening, learning and applying the resolutions, the programs and the policies that should be born out of that knowledge, out of that literal institutional knowledge that those front-line workers have about what the issues are that have created and have led to the crisis in corrections, but also can potentially alleviate the issues.", "I want to thank them and I want to acknowledge them and offer our word that New Democrats will continue to work, and our commitment that we will continue to work with them to find a solution, to continue to work to make our system better, to make it so that those front-line workers are safe at work, first and foremost, and that inmates not only are able to safely do their time but also reintegrate into society effectively. I think that’s a system that requires a holistic approach where multiple ministries, multiple parties and those who are on the front line work together in a cohesive way.", "That’s what those front-line workers, those corrections officers and probation and parole officers, are asking for. They’ve been very transparent about the status of corrections in our province. That’s hard to do because it requires those professionals to look in the mirror, to analyze their workforce and workplace and to be very critical, open and transparent about what some of the negative aspects are of their jobs. In some instances, corrections officers have had to explain and talk about some of the effects that they have felt—some of the negative effects. They have had to talk about attacks on their own person or on their colleagues, or about things that they’ve seen inside facilities that have affected their psyche, where inmate-on-inmate violence occurs. or drug overdoses or death or suicide.", "Despite how hard it is to talk about these issues, I think you will find that if you talk to a corrections officer or to a probation and parole officer in Ontario, they are willing to tell their story because they know that’s the only way that this issue is going to rise up from the deep recesses of society.", "I’ve had two terms as our party’s corrections critic, and what I think is a constant is that, in society and in Ontario—maybe this is the same across the country—when you go door to door and you talk in your neighbourhood Tim Hortons or community centre, the status of our corrections and community safety system isn’t top of mind. It isn’t really the big-ticket item that folks talk about each and every day.", "Unless you are intimately involved and have been, unfortunately, a part of our penal system or our criminal justice system, then you don’t really give it too much thought on a day-to-day basis. You know that it exists and you hope, I think, as a member of civil society, that it works adequately and that the programs and the services and the resources are there to ensure that, again, if someone is found guilty of a crime, they are able to do their time and are also able to effectively be reintegrated into society, because the vast majority of the inmates who are in our provincial system, in short order, will be back into our communities.", "If we aren’t effectively ensuring that there, are programs that address some of their issues, whether they be mental health issues or whether they be drug, alcohol or addiction issues or socio-economic issues or training or education, we’re going to see, and we have seen, a high level of recidivism. In fact, Ontario leads the way when it comes to repeat offenders. We have the highest rate of repeat offenders in Canada. That is not a distinction that I think the province and this government should be proud of.", "The symptoms of that factor have been evident for quite some time. It’s a government that has been bent on austerity, that has cut vital services and resources to our front-line public services, specifically corrections and probation and parole officers, and that has exacerbated the issue by not ensuring that the capital resources have been put in place to bring our facilities up to standard. Bricks and mortar make a difference. When you don’t have a facility or you have a facility that was built a century ago, that doesn’t facilitate the programming of the 21st century. That’s concrete walls and bars. We have evolved.", "The data is there, the science is there in terms of programming and resources. I’ll say that a lot throughout my speech, Speaker. We know that we can effectively support those who find themselves in the criminal justice system with comprehensive programs. Our corrections and probation and parole officers are on board with that. They don’t want to see these people coming back into their facilities every month, every week, every two years. They want to see people come in, understand that what they did was wrong, that they can change their ways, that they can be a productive member of society, but they are not given the resources to do that. They are given the bare-bones resources: simply, custodial services. That’s a shame, because we are doing a disservice to the profession and we are doing a disservice to our society and to our communities.", "Here we are, on April 9, 2018. I don’t know exactly what the start date is of the Liberal government’s tenure in this House as the government, but it’s somewhere around 15 years ago—15 years, and we are now at crisis level, and in a crisis situation, in our corrections system. That is symptomatic of 15 years of neglect, 15 years of not prioritizing the needs of the system, 15 years of, really, a degradation of that system and of those who serve the system.", "We called it. We told them, “You’re not actually adding the appropriate resources and services. What you are doing is cutting, to the detriment of the entire system.” How do we know that? Well, we have massive overcrowding in our provincial facilities. We saw that in Ottawa, where inmates were made to sleep in shower stalls; there was that much of an overcapacity of space. We saw incidences of the use of segregation, whereby the most famous case involved a gentleman named Adam Capay, who was in segregation for four years. That’s 1,560 days. That’s 52 months—52 months without anyone raising a red flag and saying, “This is not the system that we need in Ontario.” This is not a system that is going to reform inmates, nor is it a system that is humane in any way, but it is the system that has been built by the Ontario Liberal Party and by the government of the day.", "That precipitated the Sapers report on corrections reform. We certainly accept and recognize the need for the Sapers report and thank him for conducting that report, because it shone a light on this situation, independent of those who are involved directly, and really highlighted the fact that there’s a drastic degradation in the system.", "I’ll tell you that today, as much as we are supportive of, again, the initiatives in Bill 6 and the reforms that it puts into place—and I’ll talk about that later—as much as we support this initial thrust, 15 years after the fact, this will not solve the problem; it categorically will not solve the problem. Why, Speaker? Because this government not only did not recognize the need for additional resources—front-line probation and parole officers in our communities and corrections officers in our facilities; it didn’t recognize the need to upgrade facilities in the legislation. It didn’t even talk about it, nor did it talk about it in the throne speech. That’s indicative of a government that is going to—I think if we look at past behaviour, we will see that they will continue to do everything they can to keep the issue under a cloak of darkness. And that does a disservice to our society.", "What we’re talking about here is one of the more fundamental aspects of our criminal justice system in Canada. We have had a criminal justice system since Confederation, and it’s one that we will always, I would argue, continue to have to have, but we can no longer apply 20th-century resolutions and priorities to a 21st-century system that requires a lot more resources than the government is willing to put in. This is something that is fundamental to a civil and cohesive society.", "So what can we do? We can first, I think, as a government, acknowledge quite clearly—and I’d like to hear the words from this government: that they acknowledge there is a crisis that exists, that they see the burden on our probation and parole officers who are in our communities, who have caseloads that are just unmanageable. I’ve met with them; I’ve talked to them. They have opened themselves up frankly. They are stretched. Yet the solution is quite clear: They need more bodies on the ground. They need more caseworkers. They need more probation and parole officers. Some of these officers have caseloads of up to 80 or 100 active cases. These are individuals that they need to follow up with, that they need to ensure are accessing adequate programming and that they are following the terms of their conditions of release.", "How do you do that juxtaposed with an ever-increasing bureaucratic burden on them to report a massive amount of information back to management? That wasn’t the case before. You had sort of a hands-on, person-to-person connection as a probation or parole officer for someone who was on probation, and it was a literal relationship. They were able to confide in some of the challenges. They were able to be a resource and also be a measure of oversight. That gets harder and harder as this government layers bureaucratic hurdle upon bureaucratic hurdle on them to be able to effectively do their jobs. That’s just the plain truth of the issue. It’s as simple as that.", "If you are going to, as a government, have more administrative work on individual probation and parole officers and add more caseload to them, either you expect the oversight and the work that they do to be sort of diminished and you expect that they are not going to be able to provide that oversight and you are okay with it, or you really don’t care and you are doing the bare minimum. I would say that both are true in this case.", "So what does it require? It requires, again, a really transparent and open view of what that system is. I haven’t seen that from this government. I haven’t seen them talk about some of the failures and where they absolutely missed the mark on the system.", "Speaker, what the reality is of corrections officers in our communities, in our institutions today, is that years ago, on average, you would hear of an inmate-on-CO interaction, or a violent interaction, maybe once, twice, a handful of times a year if it was one of the larger facilities. Now we have incidents on a daily basis where corrections officers are attacked, where they are punched, where they are kicked, where they are threatened. They have feces being thrown at them, bodily fluid, verbal abuse—a whole host of physical and psychological altercations. These folks understand that they are performing a job that has some inherent safety concerns. They are dealing with sometimes very violent populations. But now they are dealing with a massive amount of inmates that have diagnosed mental health issues.", "Why is that, Speaker? Well, it is because, again, in tandem with a lack of resources and a lack of investment in programming in our corrections facilities, we have seen that decrease in investment in mental health supports in our communities. Any of the members of this House, I am sure, who have met with their local mental health professionals and those who work on the front lines in mental health and addictions know that we are also at crisis level in supports for those folks in our communities. It compounds the issue.", "Years ago, this government made a lot of talk, a lot of hay, about the fact that we were deinstitutionalizing mental health services in Ontario. I think the principle is correct, is right. We absolutely have to find more community-based programming and supports. You simply can’t warehouse people, nor is it humane to warehouse people who have mental health issues. But instead of actually resourcing the supports in our communities to ensure that they are being helped, we’ve simply transitioned the institution from a mental health institution to a penal institution. You’ve not done anything. In fact, it’s getting worse.", "You see these high levels of interaction on inmates, on officers; inmate-on-inmate violence is escalating. Inmate-on-nursing-staff and inmate-on-health-care-staff violence is escalating. None of the legislative prescriptions in this bill—none that I can find—will alleviate that problem. You’re not giving the tools to our front-line workers in those facilities to protect themselves. That’s a big failure, Speaker. That’s a huge failure.", "I cut my teeth in health and safety in the labour movement and in my former workplace in construction. It was our paramount concern. When you walk on a job site, the first thing you do is you’re going to do a tool-box talk and make sure that you identify the threats and the things that could harm you. You identify them, you isolate them, you protect yourself from them. That’s the number one job and it should be the number one priority of this province and the elected members of this province.", "When it comes to corrections, it seems like there has been a blind eye turned to this issue. I don’t know what the rationale is. Maybe it is the underlying perception of corrections where it just exists over here in the deep, dark recesses of society, and if we just don’t give it too much thought people won’t really give it too much thought either. That, again, is a failure of the responsibility of this government. It is not the society that I want to see. It’s not the trajectory that I want to see my province take. I want to see them do the job, the work, and apply the resources that are needed. That’s the right thing to do, but it takes guts and I haven’t seen that, certainly, in my tenure here.", "What are we hearing from our officers? What can help them? Well, number one, our officers are understaffed, in tandem with those who are in the communities, our probation and parole officers. When you’ve got an overcrowded system, you need more front-line officers in those facilities to guard the inmates, to guard themselves from inmates and to make sure that the system works adequately. They’re not seeing that.", "The government has touted a hiring spree of over 2,000 new COs, but in reality, Speaker, if you talk to members of OPSEU and those front-line corrections officers, when you whittle down that number of 2,000, they don’t know whether those are full-time or part-time. The actual impact is around two dozen new hires who have entered into the system and who are able to add support to the already overburdened system. That’s not enough. That is not enough, Speaker.", "What they’re calling for is a really frank conversation with the ministry, to sit down and come up with a data-based approach to identifying exactly how many brand new, additional members to the complement they can get. That number, I don’t think, is unattainable. I think it’s a number that this government not only can afford to do but also has a responsibility to do. I’ve heard of numbers around 300 to 400 across the province. When you look at a system that houses up to 8,000 inmates at any given time, that ratio certainly makes sense. There’s a whole host of downstream costs, if we don’t do it right at the point of entry and in that term of sentence, that just recycle back into the system. This is one of those expenses that can pay for itself if you really are transparent about what the costs are to our society. It’s a cost that I wish parliamentarians, legislators and governments would be truthful about to our communities.", "When we get on the doorsteps—and I look forward to it—I will be able to explain the costs and why we need to invest in this system. Our communities will understand that. I think it’s not beyond their grasp to understand that this is something that has to be a priority, but it requires the government to actually—I’ll say it again—have the guts to do it.", "Here’s another factor and a figure for members to consider: In 2010, there were 321 reported acts of assault in our corrections facilities in Ontario—inmate-on-inmate, inmate-on-CO or others who work in the facility. From January to June 2017, a six-month period, there were 677. Aggregate that, double it, and you’re upwards of 1,300 now. That’s a four-times multiplier in incidences of CO assault.", "Things are not getting better, Speaker. Despite all of the great talk and chest-beating of the government, they have not effectively solved the crisis in corrections. It is getting worse.", "So we point to this initiative in Bill 6: Will it support the decrease of violent inmate interaction? Again, I don’t see the resources.", "I will ask the question to the government, to whoever is going to follow up on my one-hour lead: Where do you see that this legislation will effectively, immediately and strategically end inmate-on-inmate violent interactions? I don’t see it because there are no explicit resources that are identified in the bill. That may be something that they’re leaving as an election goodie, something that might come out during the campaign, on the campaign trail, but this is the place to do it. I would say that sometimes it’s better late than never, but it isn’t in this case. You’ve never done it, and I don’t think that you’re actually going to do it, because you had 15 years to start to remedy the situation and you haven’t done it so far.", "Our trust in this government and its initiatives and its legislative priorities is not there, and that, I think, goes for those who work in our communities in corrections and probation and parole, and those who are affected, as well.", "Speaker, I’ve talked about the fact that those who are closest to the issue are closest to the solution. When you listen to their stories and you hear the impacts of their working conditions, it can only shock you that this is Ontario in 2018. This is a government that has a penchant for making huge announcements, big-ticket announcements, and yet when the solution is so clear and evident in front of them, they’re reluctant to actually put in the effort and the political will to fix the problem. I wonder why. It boggles the mind that a solution could be so clear, yet a government is so far away from it.", "We’ll continue to press this government. We’ll continue to work with our front-line workers in this field and in this industry. But until we have a government that is actually ready to put the resources forward, that has the tangible benefits of alleviating inmate violence, supporting mental health programming and ensuring that health care services and the resources—meaning nurses and doctors, the staffing levels of complements of those staff—are adequate, we can’t really trust that they’re going to do the right thing.", "Speaker, I can only tell you that New Democrats understand the principles of listening to those front-line workers, whether it be in corrections and community safety, or probation and parole, or nursing or health care or education. Sometimes the government doesn’t know best. Sometimes it takes some humility to get down into the weeds of the issue, acknowledge some of the problems that potentially you yourselves as a government have created, do the hard work to fix it and be accountable and open with your constituents. We’re prepared to do that, because that is the only way we’re going to get to a solution and to a system that works.", "What are some of the issues? Well, let’s talk about this bill specifically.", "The bill overhauls the rules governing the corrections system. That general statement is a welcome statement. It’s one that we think should continuously be reviewed and should have light shone on it all the time, because if not, it falls to the wayside of the top-of-mind issues of the day.", "I have to acknowledge those who are on the front lines who have relentlessly pursued this issue, who have gathered at Queen’s Park month after month, who have done lobby days here to inform members of all parties about this, and who I know are not going to give up, because they believe in a system that can work. They know the costs. They are taxpayers themselves, Speaker; they understand the value of a dollar. But they also understand that that investment into our corrections system can yield positive results on the outside—in our communities, in our health care system and in our economy—and they play the most pivotal role in ensuring that that happens.", "We support this initiative, which is going to make small steps towards some reforms to the system, but overall, this is a superficial sort of approach. It does a couple of positive things. However, there’s an underlying issue: that only a comprehensive approach to the resources that we put in will fix the problem.", "As I stated, the legislation is largely a reaction to the findings of the independent adviser. The main reforms here relate to the use of segregation and to the establishment of an inspector general’s office with an independent ability to conduct systemic investigations. It sets out the minimum standards of living conditions and standards of confinement.", "Again, April 9, 2018: We have incidents of inmates living in segregation for up to four years, without any record of that happening throughout the four years; we have incidents of inmates having to be housed in shower stalls; and we have this now today, to address the issue, four weeks outside of a general election. You wonder why it took so long and how we could get here.", "The reforms to segregation limit the restrictions and the conditions of segregation, including setting a cap on consecutive days allowed at 15. This is consistent with the recommendations of the special adviser on corrections’ report, and recent federal restrictions in place, as well as recent international standards for the administrative detention of incarcerated persons, which include that no more than 60 days’ total would be permitted in a calendar-year period. This presumably is motivated by the political fallout from the four-year-long incarceration and segregation of Adam Capay.", "I’m going to take a drink of water. That was good.", "Speaker, the corrections officers have long understood that the use of segregation without adequate guidelines, principles and reforms was something that had the potential to be abused—abused but also without, again, the oversight and the accountability and the resources. Imagine the conditions that require putting an inmate in segregation. What leads to an inmate actually being put into segregation? Sometimes it’s voluntary segregation because the inmate feels threatened by other inmates because of their situation, whatever the conditions are. That’s something that the bill talks about as well.", "But sometimes, and with limited resources and limited tools at corrections officers’ disposal, segregation is a valuable tool. It is one that they use to support the safety of themselves, their colleagues and other inmates. The government has done a pretty terrible job in acknowledging that that is one of their limited tools. That’s one of the things, the last course of action, that they have to actually protect themselves, without any other resources, without interventions on the inside that can identify persons who are at risk of volatile situations or at risk of harming themselves or other people. Again, skeleton crews inside these facilities—and if you’ve ever had the chance to tour one of our provincial facilities, I urge you to do it if you haven’t done it. It is an eye-opener." ],

I’ll tell you, from my experience, newer facilities make it a lot easier for the movement of inmates, for the adequate programs that need to be delivered inside those facilities. That’s just what society, I think, has come to today. We understand that these facilities have to be more than just bars and locks. They have to actually support some of those programs and the delivery of them.", "You go to an older facility, Speaker: leaky roofs, inadequate heating or ventilation, no natural light in these facilities, buildings that are literally crumbling, not the best access for transportation between court—you know, inmate transfer. Security concerns—let’s talk about that—where contraband is a real problem. In this day and age, we have just an enormous amount of ingenuity that comes from the criminal element to get contraband inside facilities, and outside of facilities. This is another role that corrections officers have to play, day in and day out.", "Believe me, Speaker, they are not prone to wanting to do full searches of inmates. This is not a good job. This is something that they really would rather not have to do. They would love to be able to rely on body scanners and they would love to have operational metal detectors. In some of the facilities, these machines exist, this technology exists, yet the resources aren’t there to support the use of them. So you’ve got a full-body scanner sitting there, ready to be used, but no one hired or trained to actually use it. It sits idle while contraband enters into the facility.", "There are provisions within the bill that talk about the ability for COs to inspect mail. I’ve heard stories where mail is coming in from the outside and it is now laced with fentanyl or carfentanil. We all know now that exposure to that can kill you. If you touch it or inhale it or ingest it, you die. There are limitations now on what COs can do to intercept that suspected contraband through the mail system. That’s going to put them at a disadvantage. That’s going to jeopardize the safety of the facility and of the people who work there and who are housed there.", "There’s also the idea where, again, speaking to the ingenuity of the criminal element, there’s activity that continues to exist from the inside and the outside where communications between inmates and folks on the outside perpetuate a continuation of criminal activity on the outside. There are cases where you’ve talked to COs and they’ve intercepted mail that talked about a plan to do this, to cause a crime, and that was stopped because they suspected. They had the knowledge that that was going on, and they were able to intervene. That’s called going above and beyond. These are the stories that you never hear unless you talk to our COs, our front-line officers in those facilities.", "We haven’t heard the government talk about the need to support those types of activities. What are the tools that are being given to ensure that they’re doing their jobs fully, to the extent of their training and their abilities and their knowledge and experience? They are asking for it. They want to provide a safe and secure environment for themselves, for their colleagues and for the inmates, but it’s getting harder and harder. Again, a glaring omission in this bill is those resources that we know are so vital to the execution of those programs and of those actions. I would ask the government, and I’ll ask anyone in the ministry or the minister herself: When can we expect to see those? When can we expect to see adequate resources flow through? Because this will all be for naught if we don’t see real, tangible action in our communities.", "The bill talks about segregation and it talks about the reforms of segregation. We support them with the caveat that that can’t be the only thing.", "It talks about the establishment of a chief investigator who has prescribed abilities to investigate the use of segregation, to compel reporting, and a whole host of other things that are not contentious and that I think make sense.", "It talks about representation from the public, which I think will also go a long way to bringing some layperson involvement into the regional system and to potentially expanding the knowledge base of our communities as to what happens behind those doors and within those walls. I think that’s a positive step forward.", "It talks about the need for training and a safe work environment, which are two persistent issues for Ontario corrections staff, and the lack of those or a plan to address them. As the nature of criminality evolves and the use of technology and other different hazards that exist and new hazards that exist, the nature of the training to deal with that has to evolve as well. That’s a whole other component to the day-to-day operations that this government hasn’t spoken about in the bill, but that costs money. It requires a plan, and I haven’t, again, heard from this government that they’re willing or ready to do that. We would like to see a plan. We would like to see comprehensive support and ongoing training explicitly supported with some dollars, but again, maybe that’s to be determined at some point.", "Let’s circle back: The OPSEU research has provided ministry staff with tables that show—I would imagine they provided every party’s staff with tables that show that new CO hires since 2016 were in the 500-person range. It’s not clear how many of those are full-time or part-time, but front-line staff suggest that their numbers haven’t been bolstered, as most of the new hires are used as backfill for existing staffing complements. In this era of precarious work and an economy that is built up on part-time, precarious work under the tenure of this government, here we are, with the actual government of the day adding to that metric of the economy by under-resourcing these facilities with part-time workers.", "How do you raise a family, how do you dedicate yourself to a professional career in community safety when you know you’re going to spend the majority of your career on the part-time call list as a backfill to those that have been hired on full-time—waiting in the list, in the queue, for when you can finally be hired full-time through retirement or attrition? That’s not a way to ensure confidence or breed confidence in the facility. It’s a way to have folks potentially get in but be constantly wondering about their economic security and looking for other opportunities.", "Long gone, I guess, is the era where you could have one solid, secure job with benefits and a retirement plan that you could bank on and provide for your family and contribute to your communities. That’s not the system that’s being built in our corrections system, and I don’t think it breeds good-quality work—" ],

Any further degradation of this system at this level—as I’ve said, it’s at crisis level. I don’t think that can be argued. It’s at critical level. If we go backwards, it’s going to get worse and the costs are going to escalate: the costs to those who work in the facilities are going to escalate, and the costs to our communities are going to escalate in increased recidivism, in increased costs through our criminal justice system and increased costs through our penal system. This is the definition of insanity. Continuing to do what you’ve done and expecting a different result will not yield a fix to this problem.", "The overlying theme, I think, of my speech here today is that there is a whole lot more that this government can do, should do and should have done in the past to have alleviated the pressures on the system and to have prevented it from getting here in the first place, which is the biggest shame. That’s the thing that I think people need to understand: We didn’t have to get here. We didn’t have to be here, where you see the drastic numbers of inmate-on-CO violence and inmate-on-inmate violence.

This has not been reformed for over 20 years. Let’s call it the way it is, okay, my friends?", "It’s also very important that with regard to any type of reform of this magnitude, we need to make sure that it’s evidence-based. We also need to consult the respective partners. It’s also very easy for the opposition when you also had the chance to do it. When we consult, we also talk to the front-line people.", "There are a number of areas, if the legislation is passed, where we will modernize correctional services. First, it will see setting the rules when it comes to defining segregation. Mr. Sapers has provided guidelines for us in terms of aligning the segregation piece with international standards, eliminating its use for vulnerable individuals. At the end of the day, we know inmates in corrections are already recognized as vulnerable, but those who are in segregation have a greater incidence of vulnerability.", "Improving the conditions when it comes to confinement—in terms of minimum living standards that will be applied to all adult inmates, bringing consistency across the board.", "Increasing transparency and accountability, meaning that we will be establishing the independent inspector general to ensure compliance with the legislation or policy, as well as clearly defining legislation when it comes to health care: As a former nurse, I’m going to be speaking a little bit more about the whole issue of health transformation when it comes to correctional services in a minute.", "Also, the comments made by my colleague from Essex—he is correct when he talks about the issue of reforming, rehabilitation and reintegration. We know that these particular inmates will be coming out into the community. We want to make sure they’re properly rehabilitated and supported in a correctional facility while they’re there.", "Another piece of the legislation: When we are changing this legislation, we are also going to make sure the system will be rebuilt based on dignity, human rights and accountability.", "We also want to ensure that there will be more resources for front-line staff, particularly in the area of mental health support, with mental health nurses to support the inmates but also supporting front-line correctional officers.", "Improving infrastructure: I know there were comments made earlier about the fact that we haven’t put in enough resources. When we’re dealing with infrastructure, infrastructure takes time. It’s not just in the correctional facilities; we also do infrastructure province-wide. Whether it’s in hospitals, whether it’s in universities, whether it’s community colleges or in our local schools, we’re building the entire system across the province, improving infrastructure. We have made commitments on two new correctional facilities in Ottawa as well as North Bay. So modernization of infrastructure will take time.", "I want to spend some time on the issue of segregation. Mr. Sapers’s report, encouraging and asking the government and providing guidelines about dealing with segregation—that there is overutilization of segregation, especially when it comes to vulnerable inmates, who may have mental health concerns, a developmental disability or a number of areas, like pregnant inmates.", "The proposed legislation also addresses the issue of supports and services to address this population of segregated inmates. We want to make sure that when we make this transformation, we are:", "—aligning these changes to international standards to define what segregation is: not just a specific physical area but rather the physical and social isolation of individuals for 22 hours or more a day. These are known as Mandela rules;", "—prohibiting segregation of the most vulnerable inmates;", "—phasing in time restrictions prohibiting the use of segregation beyond 15 consecutive days; and", "—establishing independent decision-making panels to review segregation decisions.", "These are very important pieces of reform. I know that there’s always more room for improvement.", "The area with regard to inmates being in segregation: We need to make sure that those inmates who are in segregation are being visited daily by the superintendent and members of the health care team, because at the end of the day, we are doing no service to these vulnerable inmates when they’re not being supported while they’re in segregation. They also need to be reviewed by the health care team at least once every five days. These are new requirements, Mr. Speaker, if the legislation is passed.", "Also, at the same time, we want to make sure our front-line staff and managers know about these reforms in terms of properly implementing this legislation.", "The other piece of the legislation you heard me speaking about earlier, Mr. Speaker, was dealing with the whole issue of oversight and accountability. This new legislation will be the largest transformation in Ontario when it comes to correctional services. The newly created position called the inspector general would have oversight in terms of correctional staff and ministry, fully complying with the proposed legislation and all the other policy. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that it is the right thing to do. There will be a body that will be responsible for oversight and accountability.", "We also heard that there will be an independent review panel, to review and make decisions on cases where inmates are held in non-disciplinary segregation to help with this regard. This particular panel will ensure that the clients are held in the least restrictive conditions possible, reaching the five or 10 consecutive days in segregation, or 30 and 55 aggregate days. There is a review process by the panel.", "Correctional staff will have an opportunity to deal with the concerns—I know the member from Essex mentioned earlier that OPSEU was visiting Queen’s Park recently; I certainly met with them. They have expressed concerns about safety. We heard them, and it is very important that every correctional officer going to work gets to return home. We are also very concerned about the fact that the correctional service staff have an opportunity to talk and share about their working conditions, and the fact that every employee in the correctional system is safe at all times.", "The other piece with regard to the proposed legislation: If passed, it will provide a variety of health services initiatives. As a former registered nurse, this particular reform interests me a great deal, particularly in the area of concerns in dealing with the initial assessment of the inmates. Just like when we’re dealing with new patients coming into long-term-care facilities, inmates will be assessed when they are coming in for new admission, which is the right thing to do. You’ll have a baseline of information about the inmates, whether it’s their health care needs or psychosocial needs. This is the right thing to do.", "The other piece is that we want to make sure that health services are comprehensive and timely and that the right care is being provided to these inmates. Some of the areas that they will be reforming deal with the treatment of disease or injury, health promotion, disease prevention and dental care. I want to do a shout-out to the dentist who was working at the Toronto East Detention Centre when I was visiting the facility recently. He was offering me some dental services, but I certainly appreciate his great work at the Toronto East Detention Centre.", "Vision care, the mental health and addictions piece, traditional indigenous healing and medicines: This is the piece that is extremely lacking. Those inmates with cultural and diversity needs have not been addressed for many, many years.", "I’m very, very pleased that when the Howard Sapers report was submitted to the minister herself, in his first report, he asked us to change the oversight when it comes to health care services in our correctional system, and to make sure that inmates who are currently in our correctional system have the same type of health care that we are proud of outside in the community. This is a very, very important step in terms of making sure that the vulnerable inmates who are currently in our facilities have the same type of health care as those Ontarians who are currently living in the community. I believe that when we transform the correctional act with Bill 6, when we pass it, it will provide that opportunity.", "The other piece here, Mr. Speaker: You heard me speaking about the indigenous and racialized populations. It is disheartening for me as a member of provincial Parliament here to see that certain ethnicities and certain indigenous populations have a higher incidence in our correctional facilities. With the proposed bill, if passed, we would transform this. We would make sure of the necessary supports for racialized and indigenous people in our correctional facilities. I believe that all members of this House would want to make sure those inmates will get the proper support that they need.", "We want to create a system where there will be cultural competency to increase the support for those inmates. But more importantly, we want to make sure that two of the initiatives being addressed by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for indigenous inmates—we are going to make sure they are properly supported and that their needs are being heard. The government is committed, in terms of oversight bodies, to enhancing the training on indigenous rights and culture.", "The other piece here, Mr. Speaker, is that we are very, very proud to say that the proposed legislation, if passed, would ensure cultural competency across the entire system to deliver similar training to promote recognition of and respect for Ontario’s diverse communities even in correctional facilities, because those inmates are all Ontario people. They deserve the same type of cultural respect and services, whether it is for spiritual needs or cultural languages support, but also, more importantly, rehabilitative programming, because we know our correctional facilities are very diverse.", "When I visited the Toronto East Detention Centre, when I was visiting in North Bay, and previously, before the Don jail was closed—when I visited those facilities, I could see that the population is aging and the population is very diverse. We need to make sure that programming reflects the cultural and indigenous communities. We also need to make sure that rehabilitation programs support those needs, in terms of the inmates, because we know that certain populations are over-represented in the correctional facilities. We need to address this piece.", "Earlier, the member from Essex mentioned mental health supports—and I want to thank him for his comments—when it comes to the diverse communities. We know we need to do better.", "I am also very pleased that the proposed legislation, if passed, will create what they call community advisory boards. If passed, we are proposing to expand the community advisory board model to establish these boards for each of the institutions. It’s not based on geography. In each facility, they will have a community advisory board. It will strengthen the links between the correctional facilities and the communities that will be receiving these inmates when they leave the correctional facilities. The board members will act as independent observers, offering a balanced perspective in terms of care, in terms of supervision, in terms of programming for inmates—especially those inmates with diverse backgrounds or from indigenous communities—and will provide advice to the minister in terms of operations. These community advisory boards will provide the community lens that sometimes is missing. Oftentimes, the various overpopulated, diverse communities don’t have a voice. These proposed community advisory boards will provide an opportunity for diverse communities to have a say, but also provide input for those inmates who may be voiceless, because at the end of the day we need to make sure they have a voice in our correctional system.", "Mr. Speaker, I wanted to share with you some positive support of Bill 6. The Ontario Ombudsman, Paul Dubé, has spoken about supporting the proposed legislation: “I am pleased to see Ontario moving to address the unacceptable practices and conditions in the correctional system that my office and others have identified in recent years. This legislation is responsive and ambitious. It has the potential to create a more humane, accountable and transparent correctional system.”", "Mr. Dubé, I want to say thank you for your review of Bill 6. I look forward to seeing you when we discharge this bill to committee and hearing your comments on how to further improve the legislation in terms of the review and the public consultation.", "Ontario Human Rights Commissioner Renu Mandhane has also shared her comments about the proposed legislation, Bill 6: “The Correctional Services Transformation Act is a major step forward in addressing serious human rights issues in Ontario’s correctional system. These reforms have the potential to positively impact some of the most vulnerable people in our society.”", "So, Mr. Speaker, three very important, independent officers of our correctional system have shared their comments about Bill 6.", "I know the opposition will be saying to us that more needs to be done. I agree with them: More needs to be done, because these are very vulnerable members of our society.", "I recently met the Governor of Connecticut. The Governor of Connecticut has been leading the way when it comes to correctional reform. His position is that those who are the most marginalized and the most vulnerable, like those inmates—he has been championing correctional reforms nationally in the United States, and he has been leading the way.", "Some of the stuff he shared with me at a recent conference: “If we do nothing in supporting our correctional reforms, we have done nothing in terms of making sure this population has been heard and making sure they’re properly supported when it comes to rehabilitation and reintegration into society.” This is a very important piece.", "In the last piece in my short time, Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the members opposite that the transformation of this bill, if passed, will address a number of fronts that they talked about: infrastructure, rehabilitation and reintegration.", "I know they will recognize the fact of mental health reform, because the mental health reforms in Bill 6 parallel some of the stuff we’re dealing with in the proposed legislation about the budget. The budget talks about significant transformation when it comes to mental health. We are infusing, in the 2018 budget, mental health reform across the board. So I would say to the members opposite that if we do nothing as a system, then mental health, whether it is in correctional facilities, whether it is in our schools, whether it is in our long-term care, whether it’s in post-secondary—we need to do better across the board when it comes to mental health.", "Last but not least, Mr. Speaker, I’m looking forward to this conversation today, and also to taking this particular bill to our committee and having further conversations.", "Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to speak today." ],

That was 10 years after they took over. You might give them some leniency on that, but we’re five years after that and we’re still dealing with legislation that hasn’t been passed to fix that issue. It’s so bad that the government didn’t know how long some of their inmates were being placed in segregation—and that after all kinds of indications that they had a problem.", "This government has lots of time for unimportant things—we look at the Green Energy Act—and things that they put immediate attention to and what it has cost us.

As the former Minister of Health and Long-Term Care, Mr. Hoskins, used to say, or started saying a few months ago, “There is no health without mental health.” Mental health is the core issue of what we’re talking about today, because we have a problem with underfunding mental health for so long that it has gone out into our community in such a way that the police are inundated with the number of Mental Health Act cases they have to intervene with. Then they take these people into a hospital setting where they don’t really belong, because they should be in a facility that deals with mental health issues, and then eventually, at the long end of the day, they end up in our correctional facilities, as opposed to a facility working with people with mental health issues.", "The bottom line is that for 15 years the Liberal government has not funded mental health, has not funded corrections, and has not done enough to look after the ills of society in such a way as to get to the core of the problem, as opposed to saying, “We’ve got a problem but we don’t know how to deal with it.” So, after 15 years, it has come to this: yet another crisis, this one in corrections." ],

In this case, again, they’re leaving it up to future regulations.", "The whole intent of legislation is to be unambiguous, to be clear and concise, and to be brought before the legislators to actually create that law. In this case, it fails to define many of its provisions, such as the independent review panel, the meaning of “serious misconduct,” new minimum living conditions, new security classifications for inmates, and the new internal complaints process.

It was clear there had just been a significant physical altercation. One of them took a very severe beating.", "There is segregation for people who are violent towards other inmates. In order to protect the other inmates from that violence, they need to be removed in some manner. There are people like the individual who had been severely beaten. You could see; you could just look. This individual was not a big, strong, physically overpowering individual—quite different. He was a little bit older, a little bit more slight—very slight. He would not have had the physical capacity to defend himself in that altercation. He needed protection as well, but there were others that needed protection. I went and visited the infirmary and the mental health segment.

There is no discussion about that, but you talk to any of the guards, any of the staff, any of the correctional people, and they intuitively will tell you this: that the way we’re doing our intermittent sentencings is a problem.

There were some older prisoners in there who would be vulnerable to some of the younger ones; who may have had drug issues or they have problems—they’re violent—and they didn’t get a lot of protection.

They can’t allow these types of things to get in there, because we’ve had a lot of overdoses in the Hamilton jail, and a lot of OxyContin and all these things that are killing people. We have had a lot of people rushed to the general hospital in the last few weeks out of that jail. It’s serious stuff. I don’t understand, myself, how this stuff gets in.

The title of this particular article is, “There Is Something Seriously, Seriously Wrong With Ontario’s Prison System.

I think it’s a point of shame for this government, a point of shame for this province. The only thing they would do was put a hood over his head to give him relief from the light. Finally, it was a correctional officer who spoke up.

Inmates, for instance, at an Ottawa-area detention facility “were forced to sleep on wet shower room floors because there wasn’t enough space in regular cells—inmates said they had to towel off the floors before they could lay their mattresses down.” Even a basic level of dignity was not honoured in these institutions.", "At the time, then-corrections minister Yasir Naqvi “first accused those making the allegations of spreading false information.

It’s a long time coming, though; a long time coming. We’ve known for years that segregation is an issue, but the ministry was not gathering this data. They had the data of how overcrowded the prisons were, but the government wasn’t keeping track of how many inmates were placed in segregation. We only know of this because the watchdog found “1,677 segregation admissions in just five months of 2015 at the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre and the Central East Correctional Centre alone”—1,677. And there were 557 complaints about segregation in provincial jails just in the last three years.", "The correctional system is not an easy system to navigate through. Even to have the courage to come forward and raise a complaint about segregation is quite something. Think of the people who didn’t feel empowered enough to do so.", "This PressProgress article goes on to say, “Noting that solitary confinement can have ‘profoundly negative impacts on inmate health and welfare,’” the government was called on “to abolish indefinite inmate segregation, with restrictions on segregation exceeding 15 days and an outright ban on keeping inmates in isolation longer than 60 days.”", "The John Howard Society has done an incredible job in this province of speaking for those people in the correctional system who have no voice and who have come into that system, in many instances, through no fault of their own. They are waiting for the justice system to become a reality for them.", "Everyone knows the story of the lion and the lamb. The justice system is supposed to equalize the playing field. It’s supposed to address the levels of power that one person has over another person, and in many instances these are women. I think that’s why the tour of the Vanier institute affected me so clearly. Many of the women who were there had been used to further the criminal interest of men, either through trafficking of drugs or trafficking of bodies, and were in abusive relationships where they were powerless. Not only were they victims, but they were being victimized by the very system that was supposed to be addressing that power imbalance.", "There’s no doubt in my mind that being in that system and having exposure to that pain and that torture would affect you as an individual if you were working in that system. So when I met the local OPSEU members in my constituency office just after Christmas, they talked about the PTSD that they experience as workers. I want to commend the former member who used to sit here, Cheri DiNovo, who first brought this issue to the attention of this House.", "We talk about these working conditions being intolerable because the living conditions of the inmates are also intolerable, and there is a weight and there is a price that is paid emotionally, mentally and physically because the violence that exists in our correctional institutions is real. It is real. The government would have to act on it if you gathered that data in a comprehensive manner.", "One of the things that happened when I was in Maplehurst is that there was a doctor’s office, a medical unit that had been built to help the prisoners access health care in a timely manner. But it was empty, Mr. Speaker. It was empty because the government had never funded the human resources to deliver the human services in this medical facility. I thought to myself, “What a waste.” I mean, why build it and not fund it, and would that be acceptable anywhere else?", "The John Howard Society has gathered the numbers, because there is a long-term cost to not addressing health issues in our prisons. One, if you saw some of the conditions that have been shared, these are far from hygienic. They are not clean.", "“The rate of hepatitis C is 28% compared to 0.8% in the general population.” So, in prisons, hepatitis C is up to 28%.", "“The rate of HIV is 1.2%, which is 7-10 times higher than the Canadian population.", "“The rate of mental health issues are 2-3 times more common than in the general population.", "“Individuals die of natural causes 15 years younger than the people living in communities.”", "And it was found, through research, that many prisons restrict the movement and work of health care professionals on security grounds and that many are too intimidated to speak out despite prisoners’ health suffering as a result.", "The prisoner advocate Frances Cappe says, “I think it’s an incredible embarrassment to our country and to our province, that we can’t provide basic medical care to inmates… The entire system needs to be dismantled and reconstructed. That would be my solution—trash the whole system and start again.”", "I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, if you are an individual like myself who actually believes in restorative justice and you spend any time in one of these prisons, you know that there is no justice happening in these walls. If you are an innocent person and you enter the walls of that prison, you will not come out as an innocent person. This becomes the victimization of victims. It is a drain on resources, because those resources are not being allocated in a responsible or ethical manner. And I wish I could say that Bill 6, the Correctional Services Transformation Act, would fix it, but I cannot. I believe that this government also knows this, Mr. Speaker." ],

That was a key recommendation from the Sapers report, when Howard Sapers took a look at some of the things we could do to make our system a better system. This was one of the key conditions and one of the key recommendations that he suggested we avail ourselves of. That’s included in the legislation that’s before us today. The inspector general will ensure that the correctional staff themselves and the ministry would comply with the legislation we have before us and with other policies. But we need appropriate oversight if we’re going to make these changes.", "That’s what I like about the bill. It includes that oversight. It makes sure that the changes that are agreed to by a majority of members in this House are adhered to within the system." ],

Everything is now up for the largest transformation in the history of the province, be it health care or long-term care or the environment. Now it’s a time and an opportunity to care. I’m not saying that individual members on that side of the House don’t care. I know that the member from Ottawa–Vanier has worked her entire career to address issues like this. But systemically, a 15-year record on the state of our prisons in the province of Ontario and the state of the working conditions—for the Minister of Labour to not even mention the poor levels of safety for our corrections officers in our correctional facilities—it needed to be addressed a long time ago.", "I’ll just leave you with this last quote from the Ottawa Citizen: “Few people realize how dreadful Ontario’s jails are. Media access is heavily restricted, making reporting on them very difficult. And even when the stories do come out, inmates don’t get much public sympathy—even though most of those in provincial jails haven’t been convicted, but are instead housed there while awaiting a bail hearing or trial.” That was from Brian Platt, just a year ago, Mr. Speaker.", "The work before us is huge for our systems. It would have happened a lot sooner had this government actually acted a lot sooner." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker. My last discussion was talking about, of course, the healthy foods part of it and the need for calorie numbering, which I agree with. I had some discussion, really, about a failed policy with this government: how we’re not seeing the results we’re hoping for. I’ve been talking with a number of teachers—I’ve got three in my own family, and certainly with a number of neighbours and friends. Really, it has to be more of a package. If we’re really going to have an impact—and again, I urge the government to go back to the science—we need the addition of exercise to be part of this whole program. I hear many times about the need for exercise—so many minutes a day—but so far, I believe it’s only a required one course in a four-year program in high school now for physical education, and that includes health. So I think instead of concentrating on some of the glamorous titles and issues, it really gets back to basics. Part of it is how to eat, but the other part is how to really blend your diet with your exercise. I hope this government will look at that, and maybe we can make some changes.", "Next up—while we’re talking on failed policies—is the cigarette policy. We aren’t seeing appreciable improvements with our smoking rates when it comes to our children. Of course, there couldn’t be any more information available as to the negative aspects of smoking. In my riding of Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry, we’re probably the hardest hit in this province when it comes to contraband cigarettes. A study done at a couple of local high schools showed that up to 90% of the cigarette butts—they pick up the butts and they review just where they’re from—are contraband. So I see that part of the practice is to go out and beat up our local grocery stores and convenience stores. Really, they’re beating up the wrong people. They should be going around beating up the criminals who are out there who are selling—this is important tax revenue that the government is missing. Instead of talking about a new carbon tax, we could look at trying to recoup some of the taxes we’re losing.", "There are a couple of things that could certainly help, and one is—in my riding, I think most people think it’s illegal to smoke if you’re under 19, but of course, it’s not. I’m not sure why you would make it illegal to sell to minors but you wouldn’t make it illegal to smoke, as we do with alcohol. If you really want to have an impact, I think that would be a big part of it, instead of the current practice of sending our tobacco police out and seeing if they happen to step off the sidewalk in their approved smoking areas.", "There was a case at one of the local high schools where they had a glass front. The smoking officer used to sit inside the staff room, and if they noticed somebody step off the sidewalk—and you can imagine 20 students in an area on a four-foot sidewalk, and the fooling around that goes on—they ran out and they charged them with an offence: for smoking on school property. The whole idea that if it’s bad for you—I think the public expects that it is illegal at that age. Really, if you’re going to have some impact, I think that’s the other part of it.", "I just want to recount a conversation I had with one of the local high school principals. He was talking about when they used to allow them to smoke on school property. He said, “I used to be able to go out and monitor who was actually there in the group.” Now he says, “They’re out on private property. I see people out there buying illegal cigarettes. I see them buying drugs. I go out there and I try to use my influence to shoo the bad guys off. But they can just say, ‘No, it’s private property. Buzz off.’”", "That’s what we’re seeing. We’re giving this illegal drug trade, the illegal contraband trade, a place to actually go, and they know they’re going to have a market of 10 or 15 kids any time of the day.", "I can go by one of the schools out in the country—back on Highway 43, we have a couple of them. The nearest village is five miles away, and yet there are 20 people out on the roadway smoking—access to anybody who wants to stop. That whole philosophy of gathering a group together—it becomes a cool place to be.", "We’re seeing the results: It’s just not working. It’s interesting when you talk about the contraband. Some studies show it’s up between 15% and 30%, and it could get worse.", "Here’s a letter that was sent to me. It says:", "“Dear members of provincial Parliament,", "“As part of my pre-budget presentation to the finance committee last week, I presented some new public opinion data (commissioned by the Ontario Convenience Stores Association) on illegal tobacco, including data on the proposed ban on flavoured tobacco products which includes a menthol tobacco ban.", "“The survey provides substantial evidence that a flavoured tobacco ban and/or tax increase would drive tobacco users to illegal tobacco sources. Our retailers are concerned that the cost of the flavour ban legislation will be greater than the benefits of this policy....”", "“We are also supporting a tougher stance on youth tobacco consumption—one that is supported by a majority of Ontarians. Our retailers feel it is important to share this data with you so that, as decision-makers, you have all of the necessary information in evaluating the potential consequences of this bill.", "“Here’s what a survey of 1,500 Ontarians (including 1,000 tobacco users) had to say ...", "“Two thirds of respondents felt that contraband tobacco was either a major or minor problem.", "“But, a large proportion of tobacco users still admit to purchasing untaxed tobacco products illegally: one quarter of tobacco users admit to purchasing” contraband cigarettes, “and 69% would consider doing so.", "“Banning a product, such as menthol, will not decrease its attractiveness: 43% of tobacco users said they would find the banned product somewhere else.", "“Seventy per cent of tobacco users said they would consider buying untaxed tobacco if there were another tax increase on legal tobacco products.", "“A plurality of Ontarians (including non-smokers) believe that raising taxes on tobacco products will increase the use of contraband tobacco....", "“Most Ontarians (89%) mistakenly think that it is illegal for minors to purchase tobacco in Ontario. While it is illegal for a retailer to sell to a minor, it is not illegal for the minor to purchase it.”", "I think that’s a problem. We look at minors coming into stores and providing false IDs, and there’s no issue around that, but they march all over the private store owners.", "Another study we have: “Study Shows One in Four Minors Leave LCBO Stores with Booze; One in Five from the Beer Store; Convenience Stores Best at Testing for Age.", "“May 30, 2011—Toronto—An independent study of LCBO, the Beer Store and convenience stores has shown that the LCBO fares poorly when it comes to checking minors for age. The study, conducted by independent research firm Statopex Field Marketing on behalf of the Ontario Convenience Stores Association, used two groups of secret shoppers, minors aged 15-18 and young adults aged 19-24, to randomly test retailers on how well they check for age....", "“When tested with underage secret shoppers (age 15-18), convenience stores scored the highest with an 87.3% pass rate, the Beer Store next with 80.7% and LCBO last with 74.6%—meaning one in four minors successfully purchased age-restricted products from LCBO, and one in five from the Beer Store—compared to one in eight for convenience stores.", "“Testing with young adult secret shoppers near the age of majority (age 19-24) revealed that convenience stores once again scored highest with a 73.3% pass rate ... and the LCBO once again came in last with 40.5%.”", "That’s some of the science they’re using to try to ban this, but they’re going after the little guy. They’re not going after the government-sponsored stores, where the failure rate is drastically higher—and again, I guess I would support this.", "I had a daughter who worked in one of these convenience stores. Of course, she had a little bit of a different slant on it. She wouldn’t sell cigarettes to her friends, even when she knew they were 19, because she didn’t like them smoking. So they would come in and they were of age, but they would have to go elsewhere.", "But she used to talk about some of the shoppers who would come in and catch some of the—you know, generally, these are students; it’s likely their first job, some of them, 15 or 16 years old. There’s a car parked illegally outside with somebody in the car sending somebody in in a big panic and putting pressure on people to sell, or coming in with IDs that are doctored up so you really have to look at them carefully. Of course, they swoop in and charge them.", "I was on the local health board, and of course I used to get these complaints. They used to bring them up, and I’d be assured that, of course, they have people who look like they’re 15 or who look like they are younger doing these test shoppings. It was interesting. One of the members on the health board was a former principal. He talked to me and he agreed that bylaw enforcement is not a pretty thing. But he said, “I take a little offence when you say that somebody’s looking 15.” And he said to a friend of his on the board, “Robbie, you know the person they’re talking about. Would you have dreamt that she was under 25? To say that she looked like she was 15 is a stretch.”", "Those are the types of tricks we’re doing, but we’re not going into our own government stores that are scoring much worse. These people are really trying to do a good job, but the whole system is flawed. If you really want to have an impact, I think you have to start looking at making it illegal for minors to smoke and taking away their ability—you know, the get-out-of-jail-free zone where they can go off school property. You’re just enticing them to a safe place, and of course, you’re giving the people that are breaking the law a chance to go to them.", "The other issue is on the menthol cigarettes. I think up to almost 50% of the population smokes menthol cigarettes. I don’t smoke, and I’ve never smoked, but certainly a lot of my family did smoke, and a lot of them have stopped. I think now, to go back and take those off the market—I mean, if it was easy to stop, people would stop. I’ve got letters here talking about that. Of course, as we mentioned before, it only means more people are going to buy illegal cigarettes. It’s not a proven way of trying to stop these people from smoking. I think that going the route they are won’t have the results. It might be commendable to try these things, but if we know beforehand they aren’t going to work, maybe there’s a better way.", "It’s the same with electronic cigarettes. I’ve got letters here from people. I’ve got one that’s addressed to Premier Wynne and Associate Minister of Health Damerla:", "“My name is”—I won’t say it. “I am an ex-smoker and you’ve lost my vote. Twenty-one years ago I quit ... cold turkey. I was so miserable for three months my wife refused to quit ... and she held true to her word until about two years ago. She made the decision to try once again to quit smoking as we were walking through a mall in Ottawa and passed a vendor selling electronic cigarettes. She made a comment of how this might work for her so I bought her the first starter kit. I would love to say she quit instantly, however this is not the case. She bounced back and forth between the cigarettes and her e-cig for the first year” or so. “Six months ago she had weaned herself down from a pack a day” to one or two cigarettes a day. “Now she does not smoke at all. She is breathing better, she has more energy, and is generally happier all round that she kicked her 20-plus-year pack-a-day habit. And Bill 45 will treat this product as a real cigarette?”", "I know I just have a few seconds, but it talks about how they agree you shouldn’t be selling it to minors, but it’s a great tool, probably the best tool and maybe the only tool for most people to actually quit smoking. They caution the government on making them as illegal as a cigarette. They are vapour only. They don’t have smoke. I certainly encourage the government to rethink that." ],

I will start by congratulating his daughter who put her job on the line to protect the health of her friends by refusing to sell them cigarettes when they came to her store. It takes quite a bit of courage to do this, I can imagine—she was a young person herself—if her friends were in that bracket and she actually understood that if she kept young people from picking up smoking, then there was a good chance they wouldn’t become smokers and they wouldn’t have the outcomes that one out of two smokers face, which is that tobacco, used as directed, kills one out of two users. So congratulations to your daughter.", "The same thing on his explanation of the bylaw enforcement by the health units: No, those are not glorifying jobs by any stretch of the imagination, but once we have regulation in place, it has to be enforced. Otherwise, it’s all for none. I know that 99% of convenience store owners and people who are allowed to sell tobacco do respect the bylaw, but in part, because we’re all human beings, knowing that there is somebody who is going to come and check up on you and knowing that the penalties are severe if you get caught helps to make sure that we continue to have 99% of the tobacco sellers respecting the bylaws.", "Lastly, again, it takes a lot of bravery to stand in this House and say that he will support that not only minors be forbidden from purchasing tobacco, but also possessing and consuming it.

I meet with her on a very frequent basis. Recently, she brought to me a delegation of high school students from both the public high school system and the Catholic high school system in Peterborough. They certainly impressed upon me, working with the public health unit, that Bill 45 needs to be passed as we bring in other legislative measures to remove the scourge of smoking and the use of tobacco products in the province of Ontario.", "I can’t comment on other communities across Ontario, but I can comment on LCBO employees and members of the United Food and Commercial Workers who work at the Beer Store in my riding of Peterborough. It is my experience—and I’ve chatted with these two employee groups on numerous occasions—how vigilant they are in asking people for identification and making sure that underaged individuals do not buy alcohol beverage products, particularly in my community of Peterborough. These professional employees, whether it’s the LCBO or the Beer Store, know that the problem of drinking and driving and, in fact, diseases that are related to the excessive use of alcohol are a pressing public health concern, so I just want to recognize their very good efforts.", "When it comes to labelling, labelling is very important.

He brings lots of ideas that can improve their legislation, and there was no change today with this piece of legislation.", "What he talked about today was failed policy—he has three teachers in his family—particularly with regard to physical activity in high schools; it should be mandatory. It doesn’t have to be a sport, necessarily, but something to keep people active and fit, because a good, healthy diet and exercise are the best ways to ensure that people have good health and stay out of our hospitals.", "He raised a really good point—again, a failed policy—with regard to where they’re going with smoking. Like him, I’ve never smoked. The difference with me is my two brothers, Norm and Gord, are quite a bit older than me. When I was five years old, they forced me to have a cigarette, then they forced me to have a pipe and then they forced me to have a cigar, and it was not good. The colour of these chairs might give you an idea of what happened. I’m not necessarily promoting it for everyone else out there, but I’ll tell you, it worked like a charm for me. I’ve never smoked a day since and never will.", "He raised a really valuable point in regard to—we make it illegal for people to not have cigarettes, but we don’t for youth. So they can’t have them, but they can consume them, and they can actually probably sell them if they so choose. I think there’s a real opportunity, if we really want to get to the heart of this, to do it.", "We also need to be addressing the contraband. He talked about menthol cigarettes as well as e-cigarettes. The people that can’t get them through the legal way don’t necessarily stop smoking if we ban them; they just go to the illegal—which, again, we’re losing out on tax revenue. More importantly, that health is still declining, and we’re promoting more and more that bad habit of smoking.", "We’ve also been approached by people about smoking cessation. Sometimes these products help people to actually stop smoking. I had one of my vendors in my riding on the weekend approach me on this.

But she used to come in just furious about some of the tricks she had seen pulled.", "I go to one of the other villages where a person had been charged with cigarettes, and it’s tough. I can see that the children are trying to get in, and they have them sign papers, but you’re talking about people that are nervous. You have professional shoppers come in—that’s habit—and you make them do things they wouldn’t normally do. They have to put up a sign saying, “We sold contraband cigarettes illegally to a minor.”", "Anyway, with the new regulations, he had to do a lot of renovations at the store. While he was doing that, he took the sign off the wall, while they were replacing the counters and cupboards and made them so they were not visible. Tobacco cigarettes came in, gave him another fine and extended his ban on selling for another three months.", "I’m thinking: Why are you doing this? Your own government stores have a much worse record—and nothing for them. Small businesses are having a hard time making a go—taxes, hydro rates—and this is how we treat them.", "More or less, back to the bill here. I appreciate the comments from the member for Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound about working in exercise. Really, when they are children, we have to get the message across. It’s a story and it’s a package. Part of that is exercise and eating properly. One without the other is not going to do it.", "Again, I really believe that if we’re going to get serious about the cigarettes, we have to start making it illegal and really giving our police the tools to do something, like we do with alcohol. I think we’ve solved that problem somewhat, and it would certainly give them more tools." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s an honour for me to rise in the House today, on behalf of the people I represent in London West, to join the debate on Bill 45, the Making Healthier Choices Act.", "I want to say at the outset, as my colleagues have been very clear about, that New Democrats will be supporting this bill. We will be supporting it because we have been calling on the government for years to take action on the exact same health promotion issues that are addressed in Bill 45. We have been pushing the government to ensure that Ontarians have information about the calories they are consuming when they buy their meals in restaurants, and we have been pushing the government to protect the health of young people by introducing new measures to discourage smoking.", "My colleague the member for Nickel Belt and health critic for the Ontario NDP caucus has been leading this fight since she was first elected to this Legislature back in 2007. She has introduced at least 11 private member’s bills on calorie menu labelling and stricter tobacco control measures, and she was one of the first to raise red flags about the lack of regulation of e-cigarettes.", "I want to acknowledge her leadership and her persistence, because the member for Nickel Belt did not give up. Despite prorogation and two elections, and despite the Liberal government’s unwillingness to take action, the member for Nickel Belt kept reintroducing her legislation until the government finally agreed to address the issues that are before us today in Bill 45. I’m proud of the work she has done and proud to be her colleague. It is thanks to her dedication that MPPs are debating this important legislation today.", "Bill 45 includes three schedules: The first schedule deals with calorie counts on menus, the second schedule deals with flavoured tobacco products and the third schedule deals with e-cigarettes, also known as vaporizers.", "Schedule 1 requires owners and operators of foodservice establishments with 20 or more locations in Ontario to display the number of calories in each food or drink item offered for sale. By requiring calorie labelling on the menus of chain restaurants, Bill 45 will help families make more informed decisions about their food choices. It is good public policy and a natural extension of the requirements that have been in place over the last decade for nutritional information to be included on prepackaged food.", "Ontarians use that nutritional information to make healthy choices when they are buying food at the grocery store. There’s evidence to show that once that information became available, consumers used their purchasing power to force brand names to change their recipes, and food processing companies used the information to promote their products; for example, to advertise their products as reduced fat or low sodium.", "As people’s lives have gotten busier over the past decade, we are seeing more and more people eating in restaurants. On average, Canadians prepare and eat at home only two out of every three meals. With Bill 45, nutritional information is moving from the back of a package box to the front of a restaurant menu. Certainly, some restaurants have already taken steps to make calorie counts available to their customers, but it’s usually on the back of a placemat, on a company website or in a brochure that’s buried behind the counter.", "The difference is that Bill 45 would make the information available at the point of sale. Customers wouldn’t have to ask for it or have staff search for it. It would be available on the menu display board when a customer goes into a fast-food restaurant, and it would be available at all restaurants across the province with more than 20 locations. Point-of-sale menu labelling will help people make more informed choices about their food items, and it makes a difference in the choices that people make.", "The Ontario Medical Association has found that children eat almost twice as many calories when they eat at a restaurant compared to eating at home, and we know that there is much greater risk of being overweight as adults when children are overweight in their youth.", "We’ve also heard about the significant health costs associated with being overweight. The financial cost to Ontario’s health care system is about $1.6 billion annually in direct costs, with another $2.9 billion in indirect costs. While Bill 45 will not, in and of itself, reverse the statistics on youth obesity, it is an important step in the right direction.", "Frankly, it’s too bad that it is such a small step. Bill 45 will only require calories to be posted. It will not provide anywhere near the kind of information that consumers can get from a package in a grocery store. It will not require restaurants to post the sodium content of their menu items, as was required by the private member’s bill brought forward by the member for Nickel Belt. It will not require foodservice premises to list the recommended daily caloric intake for children, youth and adults, as was recommended by Ontario’s Healthy Kids Panel in the Healthy Kids Strategy.", "The Middlesex-London Health Unit from my community sent a letter to the Premier earlier this month urging that Bill 45 be amended to include clear, prominent labelling of both calories and sodium content on menus. Their letter cites a study conducted in 2013 that showed alarmingly high sodium content in Canadian restaurant foods. Children’s fast-food items contained an average of 790 milligrams of sodium per serving, which is two thirds of the recommended intake for children. Children’s side dishes contained an additional 375 milligrams of sodium.", "The health unit points out that while calorie counts are essential to address obesity prevention, information about sodium content is also needed to achieve broader public health goals.", "We know that Canadians want more information about the food they consume. Just over a year ago, Environics reported that 92% of Canadian adults agreed that it’s important to know the nutritional breakdown of the foods they eat. Nine out of 10 Canadians felt that they would be missing pertinent information if they only got calorie counts. In addition to calories, they wanted to know the total amounts of fat, sodium, trans fats and sugars.", "Another study, by a researcher at the University of Waterloo, showed that publishing this information and making consumers aware of calorie and sodium counts can trigger concrete changes in behaviour. It can switch people’s decisions about what they’re going to eat. Certainly I know that when I check the nutritional information on the items I purchase at the grocery store, I will put something back on the shelf if I find that it’s too high in sodium. So the lack of sodium content information in this bill is a real concern to New Democrats and a real concern to public health experts across this province.", "The second schedule of Bill 45 amends the Smoke-Free Ontario Act to prohibit the sale of flavoured tobacco products. It also allows cabinet the authority to exempt certain flavoured tobacco products from the new ban. Our understanding from the government is that the exemption will apply to menthol-flavoured tobacco products for a period of two years, after which the sale of these products will also be prohibited.", "This schedule of the bill doubles the maximum fines for individuals and corporations for many contraventions of the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, making these penalties the highest in Canada, and also authorizes inspectors to seize tobacco products that are prohibited from sale.", "One thing that is not in this schedule of the bill is the date that the legislation will come into force. The schedule currently says only that it will take effect on a day to be named by proclamation. So it’s hard to know, from the current wording of the legislation, exactly when flavoured tobacco products, and menthol products in particular, will be banned.", "New Democrats have major questions and concerns about this schedule of the bill, which we hope will be addressed when the bill goes to committee. First, we do not understand the rationale for exempting menthol-flavoured tobacco products from the ban for a period of two years. During her speech on Bill 45, my colleague the member for Nickel Belt shared her experience with her private member’s bill to ban cigarillos. Her legislation passed, which, as we know, is rare for private members’ bills and demonstrates all-party recognition of the importance of this issue. However, the bill became obsolete before it could be enacted because the tobacco companies figured out a way to reinvent their product so that it would not be subject to the ban.", "By giving tobacco companies two years’ notice before the phase-out of menthol products, what we are doing is giving them two years to find other means of getting their products into the hands of young people. The government is caving to the pressure of the tobacco companies and providing them with a window that they can use to find loopholes and come up with new menthol products that will entice young people to start smoking.", "From the tobacco industry’s perspective, the earlier you can hook a young person on smoking, the longer you’ll have a customer and the more money you’ll make; that is, until the smoker dies from cancer or other smoking-related diseases. Selling flavoured tobacco—tobacco that is packaged to look like candy, that comes in cherry, grape and all kinds of tempting flavours—has been a very effective marketing strategy for the tobacco industry to gain new customers among youth.", "According to the Canadian Cancer Society, fully half of Canadian youth who reported smoking used flavoured tobacco products. In Ontario, that represents more than 57,000 youth. Make no mistake about it: Menthol tobacco has also been a key part of the tobacco industry’s marketing strategy. In fact, it is the most popular flavour of flavoured tobacco. More than 19,000 Ontario youth, or one in four of the youth who are smokers, say that they are smoking menthol cigarettes. Even more troubling from a public health perspective is the fact that high school students who smoke menthol smoke substantially more cigarettes per week and are three times more likely to intend to keep smoking.", "Tobacco use continues to be the leading preventable cause of death and disease in our province. It is responsible for 30% of all cancer deaths and 85% of lung cancer cases. In Ontario, there are 13,000 deaths each year from tobacco use.", "Stopping youth from smoking before they start is incredibly important, because the vast majority of smokers start before the age of 18. Removing tobacco products that target youth can have a huge impact on smoking and cancer rates in this province. A government that is serious about reducing the unacceptable toll of illness and death from tobacco use must do everything possible to prevent tobacco companies from seducing our young people.", "I want to share with members of this House a statement I received from a high school student in London name Jack Zhan, who is the co-chair of YouthCan, a London youth group that meets monthly to plan activities involving cancer prevention, advocacy and fundraising in schools and the community. YouthCan’s slogan is, “You are never too young to make a difference in the fight against cancer.” YouthCan has organized many different events in London to reach out to people in our community and last year collected 1,376 signatures in support of Bill 45.", "Jack wrote to me and said: “As a teenager, I truly believe Bill 45 is a crucial bill to be passed. For several months, our YouthCan team, with the Canadian Cancer Society, have been going around London collecting signatures with the goal to ban the use of flavoured tobacco in Ontario. Flavoured tobacco is a sneaky and deceptive tactic used by the tobacco industry to attract youth into smoking in order to replace the dying smokers. If this bill passes, the future would look a lot brighter for us youth today. End the flavour by passing Bill 45!”", "The third schedule of the bill enacts the Electronic Cigarettes Act, 2014, to regulate the sale, display, promotion and use of e-cigarettes in Ontario, which are also known as vaporizers. This schedule of the act also bans the sale or supply of electronic cigarettes and any components to anyone under age 19. In addition, this schedule of the bill bans the sale of prescribed flavoured e-cigarettes. This means that flavoured e-cigarettes will still be available for sale until they are specifically prescribed as banned.", "New Democrats believe that regulations to restrict the sale and use of e-cigarettes to persons over age 19 make good sense. I know that we have all received emails from people with conflicting information about e-cigarettes, but we believe that the government needs to act on the basis of the precautionary principle; that is, until there is a solid body of evidence concerning the health impacts of e-cigarettes, we need to take precautions and treat e-cigarettes just as we treat conventional cigarettes.", "Aside from the health impacts of e-cigarettes, we support regulating these products because we want to ensure that smoking is not normalized again. We do not want young people to vape and then perhaps pick up smoking, too. We do not want to undo the work that has taken decades to achieve to denormalize smoking by allowing e-cigarettes.", "In closing, I want to reiterate the support of the NDP caucus for this bill. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bill does not do everything the Liberals say it does. The Liberals claim that menthol tobacco products will be banned, but as I have pointed out, the bill says nothing about menthol specifically. The bill also allows the government to exempt certain flavoured tobacco products from the ban. We have been told by the Liberals that this means that menthol tobacco products will be exempted for a period of two years.", "Speaker, New Democrats support Bill 45; there is no question about it. But we would like to see it go much further. We would like to see an explicit ban on menthol tobacco products. We would like to see sodium labelling on restaurant menus, as well as recommended caloric intakes.", "New Democrats will work to make Bill 45 stronger by proposing amendments in committee. We will continue to work with public health professionals and advocates to ensure that health promotion efforts remain at the forefront of the political agenda.", "When we look at issues around sodium labelling, for example, we know that nine out of 10 people in Ontario consume too much sodium, which compromises their health. Overconsumption of sodium is associated with all kinds of complications, such as high blood pressure, stroke, heart failure, kidney disease, osteoporosis, stomach cancer—the list goes on. We have an opportunity in Bill 45 to address some of these issues and provide Ontarians with clear information about the sodium content of the items they are purchasing in restaurants. New Democrats believe that this is an important health promotion responsibility, and we would like to see the legislation amended to include sodium content.", "It has taken the Liberals a long time to finally do the right thing for the health of families and kids. The Liberals could have passed a bill requiring menu labelling six years ago. They could have supported the private member’s legislation that was originally brought forward by my colleague the MPP for Nickel Belt. They could have supported her other private member’s bill to ban flavoured tobacco products, which she introduced in the last Parliament.", "Clearly, governments should be doing all they can to prevent young people from starting to smoke and to encourage people to quit. Banning all flavours of tobacco products in all types of products is critical to this effort.", "In closing, I urge the support of MPPs across this Legislature for Bill 45. It’s an important and much-needed step to a healthy Ontario. It is widely supported by people in my community of London West and, I know, by people in ridings across this province.", "I look forward to seeing its passage through this Legislature and its comprehensive review in committee so that improvements can be made, so that the health of Ontarians can be taken into account and a much stronger bill comes back to this Legislature for third reading and is enacted in the province of Ontario." ],

There has obviously been significant progress made, and that’s why our government is moving forward with this legislation and the regulations that go along with it that will very much strengthen our ability to reduce youth exposure in particular.", "It’s important to state, and I think the member referenced it, that this is not simply a reintroduction of our previous legislation. This act has been amended to include new initiatives to help accomplish our government’s goals and it does look to, of course, ban all flavoured tobacco, including menthol, regardless of the timing. Everybody, I think, very much acknowledges now, even from a medical point of view, that flavoured tobacco products have tended to very much prove to be a gateway to tobacco use and addiction for young people.", "It’s kind of remarkable when one looks at the statistics, actually, that one in four high school students who report smoking have apparently smoked menthol cigarettes in the past 30 days. There are all kinds of other statistics that make that case as well.", "The long and the short of it is that the proposed legislation very much strengthens our Smoke-Free Ontario Act by increasing penalties for selling tobacco to kids, making them the highest in Canada, and strengthening enforcement to test for tobacco use in indoor public places. We would look forward to seeing strong support of this legislation by all parties." ],

Years ago, for the most part, they stopped actors from using cigarettes when they were in the movies. It used to be quite prevalent, a long time ago. You see it happening more these days in television programs and movies: They’re getting back to using cigarettes in the movies. I wonder if that’s something that we can look at in the future. Whether it should have been part of this bill—maybe it could have been. But I think that’s something that we have to be aware of, that if you watch a lot of TV programs, they are using tobacco." ],

Lung cancer.", "There was another one, named Donna, who was a good friend of mine.

I’ll say, “Has somebody got a coin?” And I’ll just flip the coin and I’ll say, “Call it.” They’ll call heads or tails, and I’ll say, “All right, all of you who have said that you’re smokers: This half of you just got cancer; this half of you didn’t get cancer.

One was with Karen White, a local volunteer with the cancer society in Quinte. She’s very, very committed to the cause of raising money for the cancer society, but just as important if not more important, is to help come up with a cure, and the whole cancer awareness. We had a discussion about Bill 45, because that’s of interest to them. Of course, the whole smoking cessation and e-cigarettes—we spent quite a bit of time.

You could simply see what your intake was for the day by looking at the menus. Everything on every menu—every fast-food restaurant, everywhere I went in New York, basically had their menus labelled. This was a very good piece of information for me, and it’s great that we’re now debating this in our House.

This would create a more supportive food environment that would make it easier for Ontario families to choose healthy food.", "These initiatives build on steps we’ve taken to give our kids a healthy start, which include the new investments in breastfeeding supports and additional investments in Ontario’s Student Nutrition Program.

If passed, the legislation would require calories for food and beverages, including alcohol, to be posted on menus and menu boards in restaurants, convenience stores, grocery stores and other foodservice premises with 20 or more locations in Ontario.", "It would also require foodservice operators to post a contextual statement that would help to educate patrons about their daily caloric requirements.", "It would also authorize public health inspectors to enforce menu labelling requirements, and to monitor restrictions on use in public places and restrictions on advertising and promotion.", "I think that, all in all, this is going to be a great program for our kids to make those healthy choices and to build on a healthy lifestyle. It will build on what we’re doing in our schools already, so that the kids can continue those lifestyles outside of school. Our families will have more knowledge about what they’re taking in when they’re ordering fast food.

As it is currently drafted, regulations under Bill 45 could potentially capture all so-called fast food premises and disadvantage small business owners who do not have the economies of scale that, say, a Tim Hortons or a Burger King does. Increased regulatory requirements do not impact all businesses in the same way. Small businesses do not have the same capacity to respond the way that large corporate entities do. They do not have the ability to spread their costs across many operations. Given that small businesses account for a large number of jobs in Ontario, we need to be careful that we do not regulate our job creators out of business. It is curious to me that, on one hand, we have agencies and ministries whose mandate it is to help businesses thrive and grow in Ontario, while other ministries are regulating small companies out of business.", "Again, I reiterate, the job of this House is to legislate. Regulations are a poor substitute for legislation, especially when the potential impacts are unknown and unknowable. Our job as legislators is to debate, in an open and transparent way, the merits of proposed legislation prior to a final decision being made on a bill. We are responsible for making major decisions that impact all Ontarians, and therefore should not delegate our legislative authority to bureaucrats. If the provincial government decides in the future to expand the class of regulated food premises, they should bring this issue back to the House for a full and open debate.", "Schedule 3, Electronic Cigarettes Act, 2014: Last week, I met with Denise Smith, Denise De Campos and Kristen Yeung from the Heart and Stroke Foundation. They explained to me that researchers and public health experts are concerned that emerging research shows that e-cigarettes have the potential to renormalize smoking and undermine tobacco control and smoking cessation efforts. In addition, there is a potential for e-cigarettes to be a gateway to tobacco use and nicotine addiction, and that the marketing of e-cigarettes is targeted to youth with the addition of candy and fruit flavours. Their presentation was thorough and very convincing, and confirmed my existing support for the restrictions on e-cigarettes identified in Bill 45.", "Our office has received much correspondence in support of e-cigarettes and their value in quitting smoking. However, the scientific research is currently unclear as to the long-term health impacts as well as the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a cessation device. That the tobacco industry is investing heavily in e-cigarettes causes me concern that nicotine addiction, rather than harm reduction, may be the goal of e-cigarette manufacturers. The issue is that those who do not smoke tobacco cigarettes but have started smoking e-cigarettes could potentially form a lifelong addiction to nicotine.", "Sales of e-cigarettes are estimated to reach approximately $3 billion worldwide by 2015. Although precise usage is difficult to estimate, a number of research studies identify that e-cigarette users include children, youth, current smokers and non-smokers in Canada: 3% of adults are current users, 8% have tried e-cigarettes, 16% of young adults had used e-cigarettes in the past, 18% of Quebec non-tobacco-smoking high school students had tried e-cigarettes, and 31% were interested in trying them. Given that those numbers will likely continue to increase into the foreseeable future, a cautious approach is needed. Similar to contraband cigarettes, we do not know what specific ingredients in what specific amounts are included in e-cigarettes, given the lack of safety requirements regarding product development, ingredient disclosure, information on nicotine levels and risk of abuse.", "Contraband tobacco products: Given the increasing number of illegal smoke shacks popping up across Ontario and the uncertain quality of the products being sold at them, it seems to me that provincial government resources would be better invested in shutting them down rather than imposing increasing restrictions on law-abiding retailers.", "The Ontario Korean Businessmen’s Association estimates that 5% of current tobacco users purchase menthol cigarettes. Banning flavoured tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, will not necessarily have the intended effect. Instead of reducing smoking levels, these bans will likely decrease the revenue of law-abiding retailers, reduce overall tax revenue from the sale of legal tobacco products, and open up new markets for contraband cigarette manufacturers.", "Contraband smokes are a large and growing problem in Ontario, particularly when it comes to their contribution to underage smoking. Remember, law-abiding retailers are required to not sell cigarettes to people under the age of 19 years old and to seek the identification of cigarette purchasers who merely look under the age of 25 years old, whereas we know that illegal cigarette sellers are willing to sell cigarettes to children of all ages. In addition, we do not know what ingredients are being used in the making of contraband cigarettes. There could potentially be, and likely are, ingredients in contraband cigarettes that are far worse than what is included in regulated tobacco products, as bad as we know they are.", "Closing down illegal smoke shacks prior to implementing a ban on these illegal products is critical so that we do not facilitate the establishment of new and expanded markets for contraband tobacco manufacturers and retailers. As we have witnessed, once illegal smoke shacks are established and are allowed to flourish, they become increasingly difficult to eradicate from our communities.", "Similarly, we can predict with some certainty that if contraband cigarette manufacturers and retailers expand their operations to include menthol and flavoured tobacco products, they will eventually target children, thus potentially contributing to the very situation, underage smoking, that this legislation is meant to curtail. Currently, illegal cigarettes—which are cheaper, easier to purchase and likely more deadly than regulated tobacco products—are the biggest threat to our children.", "The problem is the policing policy of the provincial government. The provincial government is letting the fear of making a mistake dictate its policing policy when it comes to illegal smoke shacks. The provincial government should not let fear dictate law-and-order policies in Ontario. Fear led to the breakdown in law and order in Caledonia, with catastrophic results for a number of families. Now fear is dictating policing policy when it comes to the manufacture and sale of contraband tobacco products, with potentially catastrophic results for our children. If we care about our kids, shutting down the manufacture and sale of contraband tobacco products should be the provincial government’s number one priority.", "Marketing to kids: Bill 45 mandates that the calorie content be labelled for standard food items in fast food chain restaurants. To date, calorie labelling has had mixed results on reducing obesity, particularly childhood obesity. On the other hand, it is no secret that advertisers target children and that, as most parents know, marketing strongly influences children’s preferences, requests and consumption.", "Just last week, Denise, Denise and Kristen from the Heart and Stroke Foundation were explaining to me that food and drink advertising is associated with childhood obesity, that Canadian children’s exposure to advertising is amongst the worst in the world—nearly six times per hour—and that the advertising of nutritionally vacant food to children is a key obstacle to improving the health outcomes of Canada’s children.", "Foods containing lots of sugar, fat and salt appeal to our taste buds, but not necessarily our waistlines. Children generally live for the moment, are more easily influenced and do not necessarily understand the long-term consequences of the choices they make today. Being bombarded with thousands of commercials a year does not generally improve their decision-making processes.", "To that end, the Heart and Stroke Foundation is requesting that commercial marketing of all foods and beverages to children be restricted. In their fact sheet, the Heart and Stroke Foundation identifies that Quebec has had legislation in place since 1980, and fast food expenditures in the province have dropped by 13%; Quebec snack consumption rates are the lowest in the country; and a 2011 Ipsos Reid poll found that 82% of Canadians support this restriction. It is certainly something to think about.", "What I found very distressing when reading their literature was the statistic that the average time children and youth spend in front of a screen, including computers, tablets, phones and televisions, is seven hours and 48 minutes per day. This statistic goes a long way to explaining the rising rate of childhood obesity.", "To say that our culture has changed since I was a child is an understatement. I couldn’t wait to get outdoors every day and spent as little time as possible indoors. So although I understand that overconsumption plays a role in obesity, we will not solve the obesity problem by only addressing consumption. It is not enough. We must also address the increasingly sedentary lifestyle many school-age children are currently leading.", "Certainly, schools can and should play a role in promoting physical activity or, at the very least, removing barriers such as onerous restrictions on children’s games and playtime. We should let kids be kids. Allowing kids to play freely is the surest path to kids engaging in physical activity. Kids’ play, including playing tag, climbing trees and any number of other activities that kids have always enjoyed doing, is either being banned outright at schools or is so restricted that the fun is sucked out of it. I understand that these restrictions are well-intentioned and meant to keep kids safe from injury, but they have the potential consequence of making kids fat.", "Yes, kids often make mistakes. That is how they learn life lessons and avoid making bigger mistakes in the future. Kids do not learn by only ever being allowed to engage in perfectly safe behaviour. We must examine the relationship between risk and reward, with the understanding that we cannot completely eliminate risk in children’s lives, and that overprotecting our kids rather than equipping them with knowledge has profound consequences for their future health, which we are now witnessing.", "I am a farmer. Farming can be a dangerous business. While risk can be mitigated, it cannot be eliminated entirely in day-to-day farming. For me, the rewards far outweigh the risks. If farmers such as myself decided to only engage in practices that did not entail some level of risk, if we did not balance the risks and rewards, there would be far less food to eat.", "I believe that it’s time to reverse the trend of continually restricting children’s play activities. Encouraging children’s play, both indoors and out, is the surest way to a healthier future for our kids." ],

Basically, the only way that calorie labelling can apply is if the recipes are very standard and the portions are also very standard. If you look at little mom-and-pop restaurants, they tend to buy local. They will cook with whatever is in season. If it’s in the summer, they will go to the local market and they will buy and they will make their soup. Depending on if carrots or kale or whatever is on sale, this is what you’re having. So it could never work.", "It is a complicated process to do calorie labelling and be somewhat exact, and it only works with big chains, because their procurement chain never changes—it’s always very narrow—the recipe is always exactly the same and the portion size is always exactly the same. So, not to worry: The little mom-and-pop restaurant that buys local and cooks from whatever is available in their local market, supermarket or grocery store will never be captured, because it would be impossible for them to do the calculation.", "The bill really targets chains that have at least 20 premises. And all of those chains already have that information. They already know the amount of calories; they already know the amount of sodium in all of this. They have this information; it’s just that the information is not on the menu board. The information is on their website.

Of course, the bill has three major components, and the member did a good job of going through each of the components and expressing his concerns about some sections, and pretty much his good support for the rest of the sections, because we all do want to see people healthier in Ontario.", "I want to focus, however, on the comments that were made with regard to e-cigarettes. We appreciate the concerns of some about e-cigarettes being a gateway to youth involvement in tobacco and being addicted to nicotine, and that certainly isn’t the intention. A number of constituents in my riding of Beaches–East York have shops—they’re vaping on Queen Street East. When this bill was first tabled, they called up very concerned because of the stigmatization this bill seemed to be giving to e-cigarettes. They invited me down, and I spent a good hour and a half with a number of constituents who had started to vape. In so many cases, I heard stories of how people were cured of smoking. It was quite an exhilarating experience.", "This one woman, for instance, who was overweight and smoking and couldn’t get up the stairs, with eczema—she’s now running marathons, Mr. Speaker. She started to vape, got off cigarettes, got off of the harmful components and the danger and damage it was doing to her lungs. She took up running, lost a lot of weight and now she’s successfully competing in marathons. It’s somewhat short of miraculous.", "We know and are quite confident that vaping is a great smoking cessation tool. But does that mean it’s something we want to encourage people to do for the rest of their lives? The reality, with an e-cigarette, is that you can reduce the amount of nicotine that’s being consumed and you can reduce your nicotine dependency until you have none at all, and at the end of the day you may be just vaping vapours that give you a nice smell, a nice feeling, maybe of bread cooking in the oven and such.", "So we appreciate the concerns. This is a good piece of legislation. We look forward to it moving forward." ],

I particularly was struck with his concern about the amount of regulation that this government deals with, and I also got his concern about some unintended consequences that sometimes happen with this government.", "I can recall, just about the same time that the 2011 election took place, that the government had made a change and was trying to have students eat healthier at school cafeterias. I can remember going to Elgin and having a mid-morning coffee at the Rideau Pizzeria and Restaurant in downtown Elgin. There was a handwritten—sort of on bristol board—menu sign. It had items like slices of pizza, poutine and chicken fingers. I had mentioned to the owner whether that was the luncheon menu and they said no; that was the menu for Rideau District High School. The unintended consequence of that piece of legislation at the time was that the students ultimately didn’t eat at the school. They walked down the street to the local restaurant and, ultimately, rather than eating better, actually ate worse.", "So I appreciate the member’s comments because, when you deal with regulation as opposed to things like education—and certainly, I think, many of us over on this side of the House feel that there should be a far greater emphasis on educating rather than legislating, but I just want to thank him for his comments. He made a great speech on the bill. I know he was ready to speak on the bill last week in the Legislature, so I’m glad he had his chance today.", "I’m very glad that we’re still debating this legislation and the government hasn’t tried to cut off and stifle debate on this very important bill.

I’ll start off with the other members and finish with comments to the member from Carleton–Mississippi Mills.", "The member from Beaches–East York stood up and spoke at great length about the use of e-cigarettes. Near the end of his time, he mentioned the aroma that these e-cigarettes give off. In fact, he mentioned the smell of bread baking and the other wonderful smells they give off. I think that’s why it’s important in the bill that it addresses the limits to the access to e-cigarettes, because, as we know, children often model the behaviour of adults. Certainly if they’re in the home and a parent is using an e-cigarette, the smell of the e-cigarettes and being able to visualize a parent using it would entice a child to want to access e-cigarettes. I think it’s important to note in the bill that it addresses who has access to it, where they might have access to obtaining e-cigarettes and where these e-cigarettes can be used.", "To the member from Carleton–Mississippi Mills, I think he made a very valid point when he brought up how much time our children spend in front of a TV during the day. He brought up schools and the ability for children to go out and have free play and to exercise. I think it’s important to note that—to bring it back to schools—certainly communities in Toronto are facing the closure of many schools that have green space, the only green space in their communities, so we’re not encouraging students or those in the community to go out and use those green spaces to stay healthy.", "I know there are schools in the riding of the member from Essex that are being looked at for closure as well. We have to look at the impact on those communities and access for those students to green spaces and the ability to free play. I think it’s very important that families have access—all families, regardless of income—to healthy foods that are labelled so that they know they’re making healthy choices." ],

So I feel reassured. Thank you for your comments in clarifying that.", "The basis of my remarks was from an experience about 10 years ago, I say to the member, when I had an experience where small bakeries were threatened with government regulation or legislation, and I can’t remember which ministry or agency it was, with labelling—these are the mom-and-pop places—every loaf of bread, buns and tarts with the nutritional components that were in their baked goods. This was going to be a showstopper for these small businesses and such an onerous task. It would have put them out of business; that was my concern. But I’m reassured to hear that we don’t need to worry about that.", "I think the most important part of this bill is probably the nutritional part, as it would be aimed at children with advertising from the food companies that are advertising foods that are less nutritious and less healthy, shall we say. What a very sophisticated, intensive system of advertising they use through television, and the kids watch so much television—even on their iPhones and screens—that they become conditioned to think they should be eating and buying the wrong kinds of food.", "This legislation doesn’t go so far as to ban marketing and advertising aimed at the kids for that reason, and I think it should. I support this bill and everything it stands for. It probably should go even further and ban direct marketing through television to kids, like they have in Quebec." ],

So I find it interesting, as the member from Mississauga–Streetsville had pointed out, that although they certainly support that it should be labelled, that it should be in the bill, now isn’t the time to put it in the bill. I’m not certain why now wouldn’t be a good time to put it in the bill.", "Today’s debate, of course, is on Bill 45, titled the Making Healthier Choices Act. Although I wouldn’t consider a lot of decisions made by this government to be healthy, like forcing school boards to close small community schools and busing students outside of their neighbourhoods rather than students being able to walk to school, I do hope this government understands that it is important to preserve the health and viability of neighbourhoods when discussing policy. Nevertheless, I do support the bill before us today.", "Given that March was declared Nutrition Month by the Dietitians of Canada, I think it’s fitting that this bill is being debated today. I’ll speak at length about the importance of sodium labelling today and fast food, which I think fits in this month’s theme of eating healthy at work.", "To help spread awareness this month, the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit held a food competition called Sliced, which attempts to encourage people to eat healthy at work. Thank you to the health unit and Food Matters Windsor Essex for organizing this event. When discussing nutrition and healthy choices, we should always be aware of nutrition in schools and encourage healthy lunches for students and healthy menu options in school cafeterias.", "Before I begin my analysis of this bill, I want to take a moment to commend my colleague the MPP from Nickel Belt for all of her excellent work on the health care file. This member has worked tirelessly on issues such as menu labelling. As she stated in her lead speech, she has introduced at least 11 private members’ bills on menu labelling. In fact, six years ago, the Liberal government could have passed a bill requiring menu labelling, which at the time was known as Bill 156, the Healthy Decisions for Healthy Eating Act, 2009.", "It’s nice to see that the Liberals are finally listening to my colleague from Nickel Belt and bringing this legislation forward. Imagine all the time we could have saved if they had just listened to New Democrats the first time—although, and as you will soon find out, I’m not sure the government listened closely enough.", "Schedule 1 of the bill before us today enacts the Healthy Menu Choices Act, 2014. As a number of my colleagues have already stated, this requires calorie labelling for all food and drink items at foodservice premises with 20 or more locations in Ontario. Of course, this can include restaurant chains, grocery stores, convenience stores and even movie theatres. What it doesn’t include is sodium labelling on menus. That’s right: The bill only includes calorie labelling. We need this bill to go further.", "Sodium levels in foods, especially prepared foods, can be dangerously high, as the member from Scarborough Southwest himself pointed out. Dietitians of Canada indicates that the average Canadian takes in 3,400 milligrams of sodium per day. Health Canada defines high sodium as 360 milligrams. As mentioned several times during the debate on this bill, fast-food chains serve products that contain over 1,500 milligrams of sodium.", "The value of menu labelling cannot be overstated. In a 2012 study, it was reported that customers at a fast-food chain who received a menu highlighting the lower-calorie sandwiches were 48% more likely to choose low-calorie options. Menu labelling works, and it is well worth labelling sodium content.", "Organizations like the Ontario Medical Association support sodium labelling legislation. It’s my hope that if we did provide information on sodium content and make that information easily accessible for consumers, this would help people choose foods with lower sodium content. Awareness may be the key to reducing the growing trend of increased sodium intake among Ontarians.", "I know some of my favourite food choices are grown in my area of Windsor and Essex county. I’m counting down the days until the opening of the Downtown Windsor Farmers’ Market. Speaker, it opens on May 30, and I invite you to join me on opening day or any day they’re open in the spring or summer.

Until there is a body of evidence concerning the health impacts of e-cigarettes, we need to exercise caution over the use and sale of these products. Specifically, I’m in favour of restricting the sale and supply of electronic cigarettes to anyone under the age of 19, as outlined in this bill. This bill will also require customers to produce identification if they appear to be under the age of 25, and ban the use of false identification to purchase e-cigarettes.", "When we’re talking about restricting the use of e-cigarettes, we need to remember all of the work that went into decreasing the smoking rates for young people. In Windsor, community-based organizations such as Quit Smoking Ontario work tirelessly to prevent smoking among people in Ontario through services, education and research. We need to remember the efforts of these organizations when we are discussing e-cigarettes.", "I’m concerned that the use of e-cigarettes by young people will again normalize smoking. Since the use of an electronic cigarette normalizes the use of nicotine inhalation in public places, this is at least worth considering. We cannot undo our efforts to denormalize smoking in recent decades. Banning the sale of e-cigarettes in vending machines is another important step.", "I’m aware of the time, Speaker, so I will wrap up. Bill 45 is a bill that I can and will support. Unfortunately, I think it could be a lot stronger and go a lot further. and I hope that’s something this government considers in the future.", "Specifically, I spoke at length about the need for sodium labelling, which I think would greatly improve this bill, and I’m not alone. I hope this government continues to take our advice, the advice of New Democrats, and decides to amend this bill to include sodium in the menu labelling provisions. Speaker, the member from—I think it might have been Brampton–Springdale—had mentioned he certainly supports putting sodium on the labels but not now. I would hope that the Liberal government would reconsider that position because clearly, as another member from the government side had pointed out, it’s very important for us to be able to walk into an establishment, and for children to walk into an establishment, such as McDonald’s, look at the menu and see that on a Big Mac the sodium level is well above what the calorie intake is. We need everybody to be able to make these informed decisions. I think that now is the time to include sodium labelling in this bill." ],

They’re very important to making healthy choices—local food, fresh food.", "I appreciate very much that she’s going to support this bill, and I do take to heart her comments with regard to sodium. It’s important that people know what they’re putting in their bodies. We’ve heard some comments in debate about kids needing more exercise. They do, but the most important determinant of health is what you put inside your body. Sometimes you can’t exercise enough to take care of all the stuff you put inside your body. So it’s important that people make informed choices about what they’re eating.

However, we really don’t know what the long-term effects of e-cigarettes are. Again, I appreciate very much her support of the bill.", "One thing I wanted to add: The banning of menthol cigarettes is, I think, a really important provision of this bill that we don’t talk about often enough.

But I recall starting to smoke when I was 12 years old—12 years old. I did not like the taste of tobacco. So what did I do? I purchased gum. I would buy a pack of gum and then I would either snag some of my parents’ cigarettes or, back in the day, you used to be able to go to the corner store and have a note that was written by your parents saying, “I need to get a pack of smokes for my parents,” but it was actually for yourself. So there were ways around the system.

I said I quit 20 years ago, in 1995. I smoked for quite a few years. I think it was over 10 years on and off. One of the hardest things I had to do was quit smoking. The interesting thing about it is, back in the day, I went to college to become a behavioural consultant. While I was there learning and understanding what we need to do to change behaviours, I had to use those programs on myself to try and get away from the habit of smoking. It almost took a life-changing—well, it was a life-changing event in which I went into anaphylactic shock. I ate some almonds, went into anaphylactic shock, didn’t know what was going on, but at that time, I thought it was important while I was having a hard time breathing—what did I do? I grabbed a cigarette, lit up and started to smoke. The doctor said if that would have been about 20 minutes into that whole anaphylactic shock that I could have died.

When we had the folks here from the Heart and Stroke Foundation last week talking to us about e-cigarettes, they were talking about the habit-forming conditions that come with e-cigarettes, that if we’re not putting in place the requirements and the regulations to keep these e-cigarettes out of the hands of our youth, that we could then be creating the habits that lead to smoking. We don’t want that. As my colleague said, and shook his head, we don’t want that. We don’t want our youth smoking because we all know the problems that come with smoking.", "Then, of course, there’s the menu labelling piece, and the one thing that I haven’t heard yet in this debate and I want to bring up very briefly is that this government has consulted on this bill with stakeholders. Not only did we talk with the children’s advisory panel, we also spoke with small business owners, we also spoke with the restaurant and foodservice and retail sectors to ensure that we are getting this right, especially when it comes to menu labelling.", "With that, Mr. Speaker, I’d like to wrap up now and hand it over to the Attorney General." ],

So I think it’s a given that we should all be supporting that.", "The e-cigarettes: There are still studies to be done about the effectiveness of e-cigarettes to help people quit smoking. But if it does help someone quit smoking, we’ll have to reconsider what we are going to do with it.", "I want to speak today about menu labelling, especially because this past weekend I was in my constituency and I went to le Festival des sucres, the sugar bush festival. If you don’t already know, in Vanier we have the only sugar bush in a town or in a city in Canada. It’s always a very good festival where all the families get together with children and we eat. I hope that one day they will put how many calories we have on our plate. You know, it’s a pancake with a lot of maple syrup. It’s the fried potatoes. It’s the bacon. It’s les fèves au lard and all of this. So it’s pretty rich.", "Anyway, it’s a good idea, because if you’re at home, you watch what you’re eating; you watch the way you’re cooking your food. And then you get to the restaurant and you know nothing about what is being included in the preparation of food. So it’s important for us, if we want to reduce our calorie intake and to eat more healthy, to know exactly what is in the food that we are ordering at the restaurant.", "They already know what’s in it, so why not publish it? If you pay attention to what you eat at home and you want to reduce your calories, you want to do that also when you eat out at restaurants. And it has been proven that more and more Canadians eat at restaurants at least once a week, and for some it’s more than once a week. So that’s a very good provision that has been included in Bill 45. Listening to my colleagues around the House, it seems that it’s going to be supported.", "Let me say a few things about smoking. Ottawa was the first city in Ontario where we banned smoking in public places, and you know what? The businesses and restaurants were supposed to shut down when we banned that, but—surprise, surprise—the restaurants were more busy. First of all, prior to the ban in Ottawa some restaurants and bars had already started to prohibit smoking on their premises and they wanted to keep it secret because it was so busy. A lot of people were going there because they were not asking the question, “Am I going to have to breathe all this smoke if I go to that restaurant or that bar?” They knew that they were not. And since we are on the border, the Quebec customer would come to Ottawa because it was smoke-free in the restaurants and bars, so it was very, very successful.", "Recently I was in Switzerland. They don’t smoke in the restaurants but people are smoking over there like—I was very surprised. So if there’s something that we should be proud about, it’s the fact that we can go to public places without having to breathe the smoke from people who are smoking cigarettes.", "I’m very supportive of Bill 45 and I hope that it will go to committee soon." ],

It was only $5 they charged to get in, so you can imagine that the place was packed. People were just enjoying the tradition that we have at this time of year of eating pancakes and fresh maple syrup, and certainly the caloric intake was rather high that day. But I think back to a time when, some of us can remember when we were growing up—I was from the agricultural community. I lived on a farm all my life. Even the city kids always had something to do after they ate a big meal—physical. I think our lifestyles have changed quite a bit since then. We had chores to do, we had animals to look after, so we ate a lot. We probably ate more than what maybe people eat now, but we could work that off. Unfortunately, our habits are the same. We still jump into these pancakes and sausages or whatever, and we have to be careful what we eat now because we don’t work it off. We put the weight on.

In one of their hallways the students had posted a poster that said e-cigarettes, pipes and hookahs are as harmful as tobacco products and these influence our perception of these products as a safe alternative to tobacco, which is not true, and that students should try to avoid using any of these products and being sucked into media influence, which I thought was a fun pun on smoking.", "So the students are ahead of us, which is actually often the case. They see the vapour stores and the e-cigarette stores opening up and they see their peers experimenting.

It’s illegal to sell and consume alcohol at a younger age; why not smoking?", "As I said earlier in my comments, I’ve never been a smoker; it’s something that I find repulsive. I lost my sister to lung cancer. It was the worst, most horrible thing that I’ve seen.

The bill also amends the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, primarily to prohibit the sale of flavoured tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes—and I’m going to deal with a delegation of young people from Gananoque that I met with in my office. Finally, there is the Electronic Cigarettes Act, 2014, which brings in a number of restrictions on e-cigarettes, or electronic cigarettes, which include banning their sale to anyone under 19 and restricting display and promotion of e-cigarettes, much like we do today with the regular, more conventional cigarette products.

Since opening the shop, he’s helped many, many others kick the habit.", "When I was at Don’s shop, I had an opportunity—I stayed there quite a long time.

They obviously talked to me about the components of Bill 45 regarding cracking down on the marketing of flavoured tobacco products. I want to recognize Jeremy Somerville, Carly Hart, Rayna Hachez and Jonathan Lancastle. They came to see me with Rebecca Shams, who is a health promoter with the Leeds, Grenville and Lanark District Health Unit. They all attended the Freeze the Industry summit last fall, where they talked about initiatives to reduce tobacco use among their peers.", "I’m very impressed with these student advocates. They pointed out that two thirds of youth smokers use a flavoured tobacco product, and there are some 66,000 students who smoked and said they smoked menthol cigarettes. Those statistics mirrored what they saw at Gananoque Secondary School. When they see their friends lighting up, they’re usually doing so, they told me, with a flavoured product. So there’s no question, after hearing from Jeremy, Carly, Rayna and Jonathan, that I really understand the need to butt out of this kind of marketing aimed at creating that new generation of smokers.", "At the same time, I know that when we pass Bill 45 and eventually eliminate flavoured and menthol tobacco, the products aren’t going to disappear. I think it’s very important that we have to—I know that the government is very reluctant. They’ve been reluctant for the five years I have sat here as an MPP to really crack down on the flow of contraband tobacco in our communities. It’s a huge problem in eastern Ontario, and I really believe we have to get serious about reducing the number of youth smokers. If we do, we have to have a strategy that increases enforcement measures to put a dent in the illegal tobacco trade.", "Speaker, I only have a little bit of time left, and I do want to mention one final component, and that’s the calorie posting component. It’s a measure that I do support. But I did have a meeting about a year ago with Wendy Preskow and a group from the National Initiative for Eating Disorders. We had a discussion about the potentially devastating impact, on a person with an eating disorder, of walking into a restaurant and seeing calorie counts on full display. Wendy’s group is working hard, on behalf of the 600,000 Canadian men and women with an eating disorder, and they’re very concerned about the effects of this measure on the people they represent.", "I don’t have an answer on what we can do, but I had one troubling statistic that I wanted to put on the record today. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate, at 20%, among mental illnesses. It’s a figure that I found absolutely shocking. I hope that the minister will engage Wendy and her group. I think we need to provide information to people in Ontario on what they’re eating, but I was particularly struck with Wendy and her group, and the fact that I think the minister needs to be able to deal with that issue as part of the bill.", "Again, I don’t have the answer.

And I do believe that the government has to take some action, especially when we will be passing Bill 45. They have to take some action on contraband tobacco.", "Once you shut down the issue of flavoured tobacco for our young people, the only other thing they’re going to go after is price. That’s what they’re going to then migrate to: price. I’ve got two international bridges in the south end of my riding. They’re going to go into the US. So we’ve got to have some level of enforcement to deal with contraband tobacco and access to other markets.", "The other thing I want to talk about just very briefly—only because other members kept talking about it—is maple syrup.", "It happened over and over again this afternoon. I also, like many members, did a tapping-out ceremony at one of my local producers, Edgewood Farms, Dave and Terry McGurrin.

We could do sodium, because sodium has an impact on many health conditions. It’s interesting because one of the chains—I’m not going to advertise for the chains—advertises that they have no added hormones in their beef. If they can ascertain that, which causes lots of problems in the Canadian beef industry because that forces lots of imported beef into this country, it shouldn’t be a problem to list sodium.", "We really don’t understand why the government—and we support this bill. This bill is a step forward. But it would be a greater step if we actually followed some other states, some other cities who force a more comprehensive labelling, because there is more than just calories. Calories is a big step—we’re not discounting that—but it’s just a step.", "The next part of this bill, the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, is also very important. It prohibits and regulates the use of flavoured tobacco. When I was listening to the member from Nickel Belt and her debate, she recalled how when she first came to this Legislature, she had a private member’s bill passed against the unregulated sale of flavoured cigarillos. She thought it was a big step forward, yet there was an opening before this bill could be enacted. Before the sale of these things were banned, the companies had already changed the rules so that they’d added a bit more nicotine so that the cigarillos in question weren’t the same as what was described in the act, and the sales kept going. I don’t blame companies for doing this. Companies are out to make money. If you’re a cigarette company, you’re out to make money. But cigarettes kill people, and trying to disguise cigarettes in different types of flavours—to younger people—should be regulated, should be banned. This bill goes a way to doing that.", "We really question the idea of having a big window for menthol because we saw, when you give a little window to flavoured cigarillos, what happened. If you give a two-year window to menthol—and there are smart people on the other side who are going to spend a lot of time figuring out how to get around these regulations. That’s just the way the world works. So we question the length of that adjustment period. Once again, we don’t want to hurt someone who has a big stock of menthol cigarettes, but I don’t think anyone has a two-year stock.", "I would like to echo the member from Leeds–Grenville. We’ve had a lot of issues raised in our office regarding this bill. Some of those issues were developed by a campaign, but some of them are relevant. As we make stricter and stricter laws for the sale of cigarettes specifically to minors, which we totally agree with, we also have to look at the other avenues by which people have the ability to buy cigarettes. There is, in my riding as well, a lot of contraband tobacco. We don’t see as much effort at controlling contraband tobacco as we see at controlling what is actually a legal product." ],

We’ve also had a lot of concerns brought to our office regarding electronic cigarettes. A lot of people have stopped smoking using electronic cigarettes, and that could very well be. We’re not disputing that. But this bill doesn’t ban electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes, whatever they’re called; it regulates the sale, so it’s a whole different thing. We’re not banning them; we’re regulating so they’re not sold to people who are under 19.", "A lot of those issues that were brought to my office—I respect it when people bring issues to my office but, on this one, I think they’re reading more or less into the bill than is actually there because, if you need to use an e-cigarette to stop smoking, you will still have that ability, unless you’re under 19, but the whole focus of this bill is to help people not get addicted to smoking, like our pages who are here today. That’s the whole issue of this bill. There may be people who are going to get caught in the transition. It’s not a proven way to stop smoking, but it could help. If you’re over 19, they’re still going to be readily available.", "In closing, once again I’d like to congratulate our member from Nickel Belt for actually laying the cornerstones of this bill. I’d like to congratulate the government on taking some of these and moving forward, but there are things that we need to look for, like sodium. There are other things we hope the government will look at, beneficial amendments that will actually make this bill stronger. We do wonder how long it will take, considering it has taken a decade to get to this point with some of these issues. We would hate to lose the opportunity to actually make the changes that we can make.", "I don’t think anyone in this House is going to say that for sodium, for one, “We don’t want to do that, because we all know sodium is good for us.” We all know that too much salt is not good for us. That would be a very low-hanging fruit. I’m sure that restaurants with 20 stores or more know exactly how much sodium is in there, because they pay for it. They know exactly how much salt is in everything they sell." ],

It’s just giving them the information they need to make a more educated decision.", "This legislation would require that calories be posted on menus and menu boards in restaurants, convenience stores, grocery stores and other foodservice premises selling prepared food with 20 locations or more in Ontario. I don’t have the numbers in front of me, but that would represent a large percentage, a large share, of the food that we consume in Ontario and, I would theorize, an even larger percentage of the unhealthy food we consume.", "To me, it’s an excellent start in terms of making sure people are informed and able to make the right decisions.

Essentially, what I’m learning is that saturated fat, which is the kind you might have in steak, is not necessarily bad for you. It has had a bad rap for years and years and years, as the common thought is that any kind of fat is bad for you. I’m rethinking that now.

I grew up in an era where my father was a chain-smoker. He smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, and he used to send me to the store to get his cigarettes. I was all of 14, and in those days a corner grocer never questioned it; he knew that my father was a smoker, and he gave me the cigarettes.", "He smoked these cigarettes, and I never knew him when he didn’t smoke. The interesting thing about it is that at age 54, he had a heart attack. He went to the hospital, and the doctor saw him and said, “Mr. Kwinter, if you continue to smoke, it’s going to kill you.” He said, “If I can’t smoke, then I’m quite happy to die.” Interestingly enough, a year later, he was still smoking and he did die. He died at age 55.", "Now that, subconsciously, really had a profound effect on me. I didn’t really think about it, because I didn’t know any different. He smoked, and I just assumed that everybody smoked, but that was a situation that has really coloured my view on this for the rest of my life.", "I want to tell you an interesting story. I got a job in Montreal to edit a design magazine, and I went there for an interview. I was all of 24. My father had just died. I went to the Ruby Foo’s restaurant, a very famous restaurant in Montreal. When I was there, the first thing the president of the company asked me was, “Do you want a drink?” I said, “No, thanks; I don’t drink.” Then we had our lunch and we talked our business, and he said, “Would you like a cigar?” I said, “No, I don’t smoke.” He said, “Don’t tell me you’re going to be disgustingly consistent and tell me you don’t drink tea or coffee.” I said, “That’s right,” so he turned to his brother and he said, “John, see this kid? He’s not going to live to be 100; it’s just going to seem like it to him.” That was something that stuck with me, and it’s something that I think is a message that really emphasizes what can happen if you just allow this thing to continue." ],

However, that whole section of the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, which precludes smoking cessation devices from its authorities, is made redundant or put into conflict with Bill 45, because Bill 45’s purpose is to prevent people from using smoking cessation devices—electronic cigarettes.", "Speaker, I have a list of 38 different studies here from around the world that all demonstrate that electronic cigarettes are the most effective way to reduce smoking.

Over 10 times more effective, in most cases, are electronic cigarettes over nicotine patches.", "It may be important for the members to recognize as well that often, nicotine patches are prescribed and are often paid for through public prescription programs, but electronic cigarettes, of course, are not.

A good friend of mine, the first person who introduced e-cigarettes to me, bought one about two years ago, and he has not picked up a tobacco cigarette since.", "The Oxford medicine and health journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research found that using an e-cigarette does not have toxic tobacco-specific combustion products. There’s a raft of evidence. I just don’t understand why this government would want to limit people’s ability to make healthier choices, which they’re doing here.", "The Cochrane Library, in their study in December 2014: “This study showed that people who used” electronic cigarettes “were more likely to cut down the amount they smoked by at least half than people using a patch.” It showed that electronic cigarettes containing nicotine further increased the odds of reducing smoking.", "For context here, a lot of people may not understand this for smokers who have gone to electronic cigarettes. We all know that you can’t go into a pub or an office or wherever and light up a cigarette, but historically, those vaporizers were allowed to be used. If you’re driving your truck at work and you’re trying to quit smoking, it’s against the law to have a cigarette in a delivery truck, but you were allowed to use a vaporizer. Now, you’re not allowed to use a vaporizer in a truck when this bill passes. You’re not allowed to use it anywhere indoors.", "So I say to you, Speaker, through to the House, that was the reason why a lot of people found e-cigarettes valuable and a good smoking-cessation device. Now, if you’re not going to be allowed to have a vaporizer in your truck or in some other indoor covered area, if you’re going to go outside into the cold anyway or into the rain, well, why the hell not just have a real cigarette then? Okay?", "There are some unintended consequences here. I think the parliamentary assistant recognizes there are, and I think the Minister of Northern Development might recognize that this ideologically driven ban on electronic cigarettes may have very, very harmful consequences and actually keep people on tobacco longer than they otherwise would have. That would be truly a travesty and a shame, that government goes out and creates a bill that prevents or is a disincentive for people to cease smoking.", "I’m going to be interested in listening to this debate, Speaker. I want to hear some members from the Liberal side challenge these 40 studies that I have, to challenge the scientific evidence and demonstrate—I’ll be looking forward to seeing if they can demonstrate to me that there is justification in preventing people from quitting smoking electronic cigarettes. If they can’t, I’ll be voting against this bill for that one reason. If this government is bringing forth laws that will prevent people from quitting smoking, I will oppose it and vote against it." ],

Quite honestly, the addiction to nicotine has been compared to being stronger than that of people who are addicted to heroin. People are able to stop drinking more easily than they are to stop smoking. It is that addictive. So there’s a balance here that needs to be found.", "I think the member touched on this in his own way, that you have to protect an option to ensure that people have a healthy choice instead of using traditional nicotine, but you also have to make sure that—and as I mentioned earlier, the students from Delta Secondary School in Hamilton who are already aware that these options are out there, and we don’t want to actually encourage youth to even try this because then they’re smokers in training. I think that’s the balance.", "There’s a healthy tension here in this debate. The research on e-cigarettes is not sound yet; we don’t have it.

It just denies it to children.", "I would actually challenge the member, because I don’t believe that the manufacturers and those who are involved in the vaping industry would want their product to be used by children. I don’t think it’s in their best interests either. That was not how that was designed. It was designed as a substitute for smoking and/or a way of getting off smoking—that’s the point of it—not to bring new smokers into the fold. That’s the part of the bill that, of course, we would support as well. It says nothing about anything else.", "In terms of calorie counting: again, important; again, necessary; again, done in many other jurisdictions. In fact, every part of this bill, again, modelled on the member from Nickel Belt’s many bills over the years, actually makes this a safer province to live in and grow up in. That’s the point. That’s simply the point.", "As we’ve said many times, we’re going to support it. Of course, voices need to be heard, and I think we’ve all talked about that.

I started young. My mom would bake bread twice a week—the best bread ever. There’s nothing like fresh, homemade bread or rolls, and I ate way more than my share, I have to tell you. If we were having spaghetti, for example, I’d load the pasta onto a piece of bread and butter, and I’d have pasta sandwiches. Potatoes on the table, hey, butter that bread, put the potatoes on there, I was in seventh heaven; maybe a splash of Heinz tomato ketchup on there—presto, potato sandwiches. French fries, absolutely; chip butties they call them in England, French fry sandwiches—anything for me to wolf down more of that great bread that my mom used to make.", "Even after a great roast beef dinner, instead of dessert, I’d put bread and butter down, pour gravy over it, add a little bit of pepper, that was my dessert—anything to get that bread in there. I had no shame. Ketchup sandwiches, absolutely; mustard on toast any day of the week; cucumber sandwiches—it didn’t matter.", "I loved bread so much I would eat anything. I still eat way more bread than I should. I apologize somewhat for that. I don’t eat as much as I used to. That’s because my mom lives in Newfoundland and I don’t find the same quality of bread up in this area.

Our federal, provincial and territorial health ministers have recognized that Canada is in the midst of a childhood obesity epidemic. The Heart and Stroke Foundation has found that, “Between the ages of six and 12, children develop eating habits and attitudes that they may carry with them for the rest of their lives.”", "There are socio-economic factors at play as well. The presidents’ council says, “Young people in households where no members had more than a high school diploma were more likely to be overweight/obese than were those in households where the highest level of education was post-secondary graduation.”", "The Heart and Stroke Foundation tells me that since 1978, when my son was born, obesity among Canadian children has tripled. These days, 31% of our kids are overweight or obese. Four out of five of these kids will carry that extra weight well into their adult years and remain overweight or obese. That means they will be in a higher risk group, such as I am, for high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke, as well as many other chronic diseases.", "Our children watch way more TV these days than we used to and they watch way more commercials on TV than we used to, advertising unhealthy food choices that are high in fat, salt, sugar and calories.", "Now to Bill G45, making healthier Speaker—the Making Healthier Choices Act, Speaker.

They were reluctant to take it because in their supermarkets they weren’t used to fresh corn on the cob. The corn on the cob that they had in those days in Newfoundland was old. It wasn’t very good. I had to practically bend arms to get them to try this sweet corn from southwestern Ontario.

Obesity in Ontario ends up costing the health care system $1.6 billion in direct costs and $2.87 billion in indirect costs. I’ll do the math for you, Speaker: That’s a total of $4.4 billion each and every year, or at least until they can update the figures because we know the cost of health care isn’t going down and the obesity problem isn’t going away any time soon.", "One of the biggest flaws in this bill—and it’s actually unforgivable, Speaker—is that the Liberals have turned a blind eye to the issue of sodium in our food choices.

This is just a changing generation. They are sedentary. They are not running around. They may be in organized sports, but they are not in the unorganized sports that we know from the past, where you would skate on the river until your feet froze, all night long, every day. That’s an enormous caloric engine just burning calories like crazy. We’re not doing that any longer. I don’t know what has shifted, but we have to recognize that.

It was the second of two meetings. They scheduled the meeting knowing the Ontario budget is coming up and knowing the treasurer has indicated that he wants to get some more money out of tobacco; he wants to do something about the loss of tobacco tax revenue. It became very clear from the presenters that it’s not only Ontario; Canada does have to face up to the fact that contraband is a problem. It’s one of the biggest of its kind in the world. The solutions are complex.", "Estimates suggest that the Canadian contraband tobacco market is larger in proportion to our population than that of any other western country, and Ontario is thought to have the highest rate of contraband of any jurisdiction in North America, possibly in the developed world. Again, I ask: Why is that? In fact, contraband product accounts for 33%, about one in three cigarettes purchased in Ontario. Some estimates push it up to 50%.

They will fill that gap.", "Next door in Quebec, contraband use has gone down by 15%. Quebec introduced legislation—it was Bill 59—that provided resources and power to local police to address the illegal trade. It was introduced back in 2009, and since then Quebec has successfully reduced its rate of contraband by half, and it has, as well, increased its tobacco tax revenues. There’s a road for the Treasurer of Ontario to fulfill his goal of getting a bit more money out of tobacco taxation. Again, if Quebec can do this, why cannot the province of Ontario?", "I made mention earlier of an advertisement. It’s at the Queen’s Park subway station. It highlights the fact that tobacco is a cash cow for organized crime. The RCMP estimates that there are 175 criminal gangs that profit from the trade. It’s a low-risk, high-reward crime, and, as we know, used to finance so many other illegal activities—the trade in guns and drugs; human smuggling.", "Much of the answer, in my view, and I did introduce legislation a number of years ago to slash the tax rate and see how that works—see if that works like it did back in the 1990s, when it was done by Bob Rae and Jean Chrétien—because we know, with respect to the product of tobacco, that continually raising taxes increases the sale of illegal trade—those people who are tax-averse.", "We’ve got a situation. We are playing into the hands of the criminals, and there are a number of consequences of doing this: the almost incremental year-by-year increase in tobacco taxes. Communities become less safe—less respect for the law. Government revenues do not increase accordingly. Small businesses like our corner stores shut up their doors. More young people have access to tobacco. It’s delivered to the schools; it’s available in the trunk of a car. My fifth point: Organized crime wins.", "I have invited people over the years to come down to my riding.

At least four of the recent seizures involved members of a well-known motorcycle gang—I do not mention their name anymore because of some bad experiences a few years ago. It was very serious stuff. Why we’ve allowed that particular motorcycle gang into the province of Ontario—and I will admit that they arrived when we held government.", "In the 10 networks that came up against the police, over 170 arrests were made, some members of the Mafia. The moving of illegal product from the US side of Akwesasne—this is tobacco from North Carolina. This isn’t tobacco from down in Norfolk or Brant or Elgin or Oxford. Tobacco comes up; weapons come up; cocaine comes up. In return, we send down marijuana, ecstasy, and illegal migrants, on occasion.", "We have the argument that high taxes are necessary to prevent smoking. The problem is that close to half the smokers in Ontario don’t pay any taxes at all. It has no impact on them at all. These are the people, young people, out in front of the high school.

I’ll try to focus my remarks in this area, particularly the notion of the contraband tobacco that comes into Canada in Ontario. He makes the comment that much of this tobacco is not grown in Ontario but is actually coming up from the US, and that, of course, is a tragedy.", "But I characterize his remarks as being a tremendously public-spirited speech, in the sense that this is an area of Ontario that he represents which once was called the breadbasket—it’s probably not the right word—of tobacco production, where so much tobacco was grown. It’s my understanding that so much of that tobacco—some of it still does get to the US, where it’s produced and comes back in contraband tobacco. For him to be up and speaking to the public good, I think, is a fantastic indication of his great public-spirited will.", "We know that this bill is focusing on trying to remove people’s desire to smoke. In that sense, that is a great strategy for removing contraband tobacco from the marketplace: by reducing the desire, reducing the marketplace for people who want to smoke, where it’s young people who are starting on menthol tobacco. You’ll know, Mr. Speaker, that much of the contraband cigarettes that are coming up are not flavoured cigarette tobacco; that’s coming from the more traditional brands.", "It reminds me of a conversation I had at an airport one day when I met a gentleman in a bar, during those days when you could smoke in airport lobbies. He was commenting that a fellow next to him lit up a cigarette, and he turned to the fellow and said, “Thank you for smoking. It’s good for business.” His friend turned back and said, “What, do you work for the large cigarette companies?” He said, “No, I’m an oncologist.”", "The reality is, smoking kills people. I appreciate the fact that we want to curb contraband and the production of illegal cigarettes in Ontario." ],

There used to be a farm just on the outskirts of a little place called Cottam, and they used to sell sweet corn; that was their business. They had a booth at the road where you could buy cobs of corn, or you could buy hot corn dipped in butter." ],

Maybe not the healthiest snack you’d ever want to have, but it was a tremendous product.", "I have had a number of constituents call me who are very interested in the food labelling part of this bill. They think that’s a good thing. I don’t know whether food labelling stops people from eating a certain thing. If you have a craving for a hamburger or whatever, you’re probably going to eat it. I think the whole thing with food is a balanced diet. There’s nothing wrong with having a hamburger at a hamburger stand, but you wouldn’t want to live on that all your life.", "It’s too bad we just couldn’t have a prohibition on cigarettes, but we certainly saw what happened in the States with the Volstead Act. It just didn’t work. I know all members in here know what the Volstead Act was. It was introduced in the 1920s and was repealed—I think it was in 1933. People made a lot of money off of that business, and they still got their alcohol. Unfortunately, a total ban on cigarettes in this country, although ideal, probably wouldn’t work." ],

  "text" : [ "I appreciate the feedback. I focused on tobacco and the illegal side. The Speaker may recall that when I was first elected I sat on that side and Bob Rae was sitting on this side. As a Progressive Conservative, I was impressed with what Bob Rae and Jean Chrétien had accomplished, just a year or so before, in 1994, when they crashed tobacco taxes. I was working for the Addiction Research Foundation. Again, I spent a lot of time in my neighbourhood and on Six Nations, and I was able to report back to ARF that because of that crashing of taxes, overnight, 200 smoke shacks disappeared. It’s a different climate now. There’s a lot more vested interest, a lot more money involved. I know that the young guys are not going to want to lose their big, black, four-wheel-drive GMC pickup trucks, so there’s a lot more at stake. But that approach worked at the time.", "I dipped my foot in the water with respect to that in this Legislature. I introduced legislation—I titled it the Tobacco Tax Reduction Act—to reduce taxes by one third to try and stem the flow. I proposed that a stick or a cigarette be reduced to 8.3 cents from 12.35 cents, and called for a similar cut at the federal level, as did Bob Rae and Jean Chrétien, who went along with that, as did a number of other provinces—Prince Edward Island, for one, as I recall. It worked at the time.", "We have a very price-sensitive product given the high levels of taxation, and I think we still have to look at some of the economic reasons for why people continue to smoke cheap cigarettes." ],

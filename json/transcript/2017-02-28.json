  "text" : [ "It’s always an honour and a privilege to stand and bring words on behalf of the good people of Algoma–Manitoulin, particularly this morning on Bill 68, the Modernizing Ontario’s Municipal Legislation Act. One of the things that our member from Windsor–Tecumseh, who spoke to this, says: “Where is the beef in this bill?” I’ll be trying to touch on some of that with my comments.", "What I want to do, through my brief amount of time that I have here this morning, is try to put a flavour to it from a northern perspective. Although municipalities and governments are on the front line every day serving and helping Ontarians with their daily lives, they don’t all work with the same realities. Those are facts from northern Ontario and in many small communities in rural Ontario.", "Communities in my riding of Algoma–Manitoulin and the rest of northern Ontario definitely don’t require the same for their municipalities as Torontonians do. Maybe we don’t have streetcars or subway lines in Wawa or maybe we don’t have six million people living in the greater Blind River area, but we have families, we have businesses, we have communities and we have services that need to be tended to. That doesn’t mean that northern municipalities need less from our Ontario’s government; it simply means that those municipalities have different needs.", "As my colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh mentioned many times in his comments when we were last debating this bill, a large part of this bill is a lot of housekeeping. We understand that from time to time we do need to update and modernize legislation, and that’s how we do things in this province. Like my colleague said, a good portion of this bill is about tying up loose ends, and that’s good. However, the real problem about this bill is not what it does; it’s about what it doesn’t do.", "Municipalities across the province have to deal with an increasing fiscal gap, a lack of revenue tools and a constant download of responsibility from this provincial government. The real problem with this bill is that we pretend to be blind to those realities in order to make it easier when we are talking about modernizing our province’s municipal laws. If we are going to do housekeeping and open the discussion about modernizing and improving our municipal laws, let’s actually address the broader issues. They aren’t new issues. They’ve been coming to this table, and we’ve been hearing from municipal leaders time and time again, so they’re not new. We just really need to roll up our sleeves and tackle them. I’ve heard about these problems from municipalities all over my riding as well as from organizations like the Ontario Good Roads Association and the Association of Municipalities of Ontario.", "First, let’s talk about the most obvious problem: the fiscal gap. Last year’s budget was not adequately addressing the growing problem for so many municipalities. Actually, the Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund, the main provincial funding source for smaller municipalities, had its budget reduced again. Of course, the provincial government justified itself by saying that it’s uploading the costs of certain services like social assistance, ODSP and courtroom security.", "But what’s not fair is that the larger communities are benefiting far more from the uploading and responsibilities. Those are some of the realities that many municipalities across northern Ontario and rural areas are facing. They’re not asking for anything more, but they certainly want to have something that is fair, recognizing the challenges that are there for northern municipalities, and the fact that there are greater challenges that are there in access to capacity, access to technical engineering when it is required, and the cost of that specialty that you need to bring to northern municipalities. Most of the time, we don’t have those in our backyards. Those individuals and those resources and that capacity are sitting in southern Ontario. It takes a huge investment in order to bring them up to northern Ontario.", "In our construction season, our projects are delayed because of the challenges that are there. Mother Nature doesn’t always co-operate in construction season.", "The costs in smaller communities are far less, but the cuts in the Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund hit them a lot harder. Losing $50,000 from the partnership fund with a bigger municipality means a lot less than in a small municipality in northern Ontario—about 1,000 to 5,000 people. That’s a big impact on them. We need to recognize that in some of the discussions we’re having.", "The problem is that rural and northern communities need that money. I’m all for government uploads and more responsibility, but not at a cost of cutting into the budget of small communities that were counting on that money to balance their finances. Again, not all communities have the same needs. Property taxes are not enough to keep small, northern communities afloat.", "A lot of the communities across northern Ontario—and I raised this with the Premier just before the Christmas break, the impact that MPAC is having on their communities. Some of these communities in northern Ontario are looking at a 318% increase on their MPAC assessments. The formula and the information they are using by making an adjustment on assessments on industry, shifting that over to residential properties, is a huge impact on those municipalities, because now they’re going to have to make an adjustment: “Do we raise our taxes? And if we do, what does that mean?” Those are a lot of the challenges that we have.", "I was very disappointed with the response that I got, because I did get a commitment from the Premier here in the House during question period that she would actually take the time to look at the MPAC assessments. The response that I received was, “ You’re right”—sorry, she didn’t say I was right, but she did say that she was looking into it, and shifted it over to the Minister of Finance. Not getting a response from the Minister of Finance, I followed up with him, asking for a response. Stating the obvious in a response was really a slap in the face to a lot of the municipalities in northern Ontario that were looking towards this government for actually putting a focus on MPAC and what was going on. But they didn’t, and we still look at farming—farmers are being affected by this, and are being targeted in our area. Northern communities are being targeted by MPAC, by their assessments. A lot of people are hurting right now.", "Today, we’re talking about Bill 68, and I’ll be touching on those impacts of MPAC, hydro costs, and what it means for the struggles and the pressures that are being put on our municipalities. They’re having to challenge themselves: Am I going to be able to keep my arena open? Will I be able to provide that service to my community, and if I shut it down, will I lose anybody in my community? Will we lose that revenue coming in from surrounding communities? I’ll come back to that in a bit, Mr. Speaker.", "The Association of Municipalities of Ontario noted that for almost half of Ontario’s municipal governments, a 1% property tax increase raises just $50,000—only $50,000, that’s it; not only an increase far from enough to compensate for the fiscal gap, but still an increase forced upon families who just can’t afford it.", "The Rural Ontario Municipality Association and the Association of Municipalities of Ontario both asked the Ontario government for an increase of $11 million for the Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund. That was just to reflect inflation. Well, unfortunately the government refused to meet the requests of municipalities.", "Funding is necessary and essential for the good of municipalities across our province, but the government doesn’t seem to want to talk about it. If this is not the right time to discuss the problem, I’m not sure when it’s going to be a good time to discuss that problem.", "I want to go back to the struggles of the municipalities in my area, on the North Shore. I have one community where they have just built a beautiful school in order to bring in—well, I shouldn’t say “just built.” They have added in a new portion, an elementary portion to the high school. They have a great arena there. We’re going to be meeting up—Andrea, our leader, and myself—with the mayors in the area, and we’re going to be talking about some of those challenges that those mayors are facing by keeping their infrastructure open, because of the added burdens of cost, because of the lack of revenue tools, because of the high hydro costs that have really put them in a very tough position to maintaining that infrastructure and keeping that open.", "That one arena is not just for that one community; it feeds in from Sault Ste. Marie because of the cheaper ice times. There are a lot of junior hockey teams that come out to that area, which supplements some of that revenue for the community. There are other communities that tie into that area, and Desbarats as well, that use that arena. Unfortunately, they’re going to be put into the position: What do we do? What is best for our community as well?", "Essentially, the government is downloading responsibilities, along with the problem of balancing the budget. Rural and northern communities don’t have the same resources that the Ontario government does. Instead of diffusing the costs to help smaller communities by refunding the provincial program, we put the burden on the shoulders of hard-working rural and northern Ontario families who already pay too much.", "In my riding of Algoma–Manitoulin, towns are small and sometimes isolated. That means they have to do more with less. This bill won’t fix the situation and won’t help with what is actually happening in the communities around Ontario.", "Bill 68 won’t fix financial gaps, and the government doesn’t seem to want to listen to what’s really going on. The government should have committed to doing public hearings across the province in order to listen to the concerns of municipal leaders and the concerns of citizens. The government should have held a proper review so we could pinpoint similar problems and find flexible solutions for a bigger number of northern and rural municipalities.", "The need for modernizing municipal legislation is a real one, but we need to address what’s being actually demanded in large numbers. New revenue tools for municipalities has been on the ask for a very long time. It’s a demand I’ve been hearing for a while from towns, big and small. Property tax is not enough to pay for what is demanded by municipalities anymore.", "The provincial government has not only downloaded responsibilities to municipal governments—which they will need to pay—but the provincial government has also defunded the programs to help municipalities pay. On top of that, this government wants us to modernize municipal legislation without considering new revenue tools for municipalities.", "Please don’t tell me that I’m the only one seeing the irony in that, because that’s what municipalities have been asking for.", "Rural and northern communities can’t pay if they don’t have new tools, and if they can’t pay, that means taxpayers will have to pick up the tab. It’s already hard enough for some families to make it through the month and ask municipalities to go year by year. With hydro bills hitting people living in rural and northern Ontario harder than in the rest of the province—and that’s a fact—I’d think this government would reconsider—would think about putting a bigger burden on their shoulders.", "People living up north make this province more vibrant and beautiful. We don’t want everybody to move out of northern Ontario to southern Ontario because, frankly, what kind of Ontario would we have? We love living in the north. That’s our Ontario.", "Just this weekend I watched Team McCarville, from Thunder Bay, who proudly represented northern Ontario at the Scotties. We have our Olympic champion who is going to be going, Team Jacobs, from Sault Ste. Marie.", "That’s what we have in northern Ontario: We have champions that are there. But we want to be able to champion our cause as well. We need a partner on those ices. We need the government to come to the table. I come from northern Ontario, and I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else. Give municipalities the tools they’re looking for so that they can champion their causes and what they’re looking for.", "I say this on behalf of everyone across my riding of Algoma–Manitoulin but also on behalf of every northerner: We need to make sure that life stays affordable in the north. To stay vibrant, northern communities need young families, but if all we have to offer up north are higher hydro rates and higher property taxes, with shrinking municipal and provincial services, how can we expect the people to settle in and find a home in northern Ontario?", "I don’t want to get started on the transportation and roads issues we have in northern Ontario. I had another issue just last week where, once again, the Trans-Canada Highway was shut down. It was shut down for eight hours. That’s a regular. We had communities that couldn’t get to work. We had kids that couldn’t get to school. We had product that was sitting for a lengthy period of time on the roads. We had industry that was being affected. That’s another discussion for another day, but it’s also a fact that we face in northern Ontario.", "Again, we’re not asking for more. We’re asking for what is fair, and we certainly deserve what is rightfully entitled to us.", "To be clear, less people means less money, leading to—you guessed it—less services, leading to even less people settling in northern Ontario. It’s a vicious circle, and we can break it right now.", "Not only do we need to work with municipalities to make sure that we find the right funding level, adapted to the different regions and needs of this province, but we also need to make sure we give them the tools they need to do what is expected from them. Because municipalities don’t have all the same realities, we should be looking into different ways to help them tackle their financial problems. We need different options to respond to different needs.", "Let me give you an example, in the short period of time that I have left. For example, a hotel tax would greatly benefit larger cities but could kill a small northern community that might count on tourism to boost its revenues. That’s just a fact.", "Municipal leaders have ideas to make this province better and to ensure that their communities flourish, but we need to listen to them and give them the tools they need to succeed. Wishful thinking won’t be enough.", "Not having new revenue tools forces municipalities to depend more and more on property taxes, not to mention that Ontario already has the highest property taxes in Canada. The Association of Municipalities of Ontario says that without additional sources of funding, municipalities around the province will be forced to raise property taxes by 8.35% every year for the next 10 years, and that’s just to keep their heads above water.", "Speaker, can you imagine the financial pressure that is going to be put on families and people with low incomes? That means doubling property taxes in just a decade, in a province where it’s already the highest. Not to mention that it will only cover the existing standard of services and infrastructure—not new ones, but just maintaining what is there. So forget about improving your city. Not only will citizens be crushed by higher taxes; municipalities won’t even be able to get things done. Again, maintaining will be the goal—maintaining. And then what? What do you do next? Can you imagine paying more and more each year just to have exactly the same services for the next 10 years? That’s not a sign of a vibrant community; that’s a sign of a community in trouble.", "At the same time, please don’t forget that the province will most likely put more responsibility on their shoulders. Governments have been consecutively downloading responsibilities and quietly reducing the funding to municipalities. The thing is that it might seem logical to download responsibilities like municipal transit operations or the repair of social housing; communities probably know better how to manage their local operations. But those operations cost money, often more money than what a single community can pay for. That’s where the province should be stepping in. That’s what they’re supposed to do. If every community runs smoothly, that doesn’t just benefit each individual region; it benefits all of the regions in northern Ontario. It benefits Ontario as a whole.", "My time has already run out and I have a lot more to say on this bill, because municipalities have been asking—this is not new. They’ve been asking for these tools.", "I want to end with a comment that I started with from my colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh: Where is the meat? Where is the beef in this bill? It’s not there." ],

It would have been the largest transmission build, or one of the largest, in the history of the province of Ontario. To get out of that contract that had been negotiated by the previous Liberal government, they paid $130 million to the province of Manitoba to cancel a contract that would have brought in power at four cents a kilowatt hour for 20 years." ],

I certainly appreciated the messaging that was coming forward from our commodity organizations: the Huron County Dairy Producers, the Huron county beef producers, the egg farmers of Huron county, and the list goes on.", "I appreciate, also, the fact that all of our local municipalities in Huron county were very well represented. There was some very important dialogue shared because, as the member from Algoma–Manitoulin mentioned, farmers are targeted with regard to MPAC assessments, and the changing landscape that comes down to affecting farmers in a negative light needs to be considered because they’re in a bind. Farmers across Ontario are price takers; they’re the last stop in the value chain, Speaker. We need to be doing something that enables our farmers to be competitive in a stable and predictable environment here in this province.", "Unfortunately, time and again, this Liberal government of the day handcuffs farmers across Ontario from being the best that they can be. I just needed to share that because you mentioned that the farmers were targeted, and it was very much evident on Friday.", "Going back to Bill 68, I do want to say, though, that we need to have committee hearings in multiple areas of the province to hear from municipalities—large, small, rural, urban, southern, northern, inclusively—so we can hear how these changes are impacting them directly and that it’s an authentic consultation." ],

I was one of those guys who got caught in the sweep. The point is, I remember distinctly sitting on that side of the House, having seen hydro rates go up by 10% because of what was going on with Darlington the first year we were there. In other words, we were elected in 1990 in the fall and obviously we were in that budget year, and hydro rates were going up by double digits. So we decided to freeze hydro rates for four years.", "The Conservatives came in after us. They continued the freeze. I don’t remember for how many years, but they continued the freeze for some time.", "I remember the Liberals being apoplectic. I remember the eloquent speeches of Mr. Bradley, Mr. Nixon, Mrs. McLeod and others who were here at the time. They were just up in arms that the NDP had the gall to freeze the hydro rates. You can’t have it both ways. You can’t, when we were in government, chastise us for freezing rates, and now that we’re on the opposition side and you’re in the government, you make up that somehow or other we’re the ones who raised hydro rates.", "I’ll take Ontario hydro rates pre-1995 any day compared to what I pay today and what people in my constituency pay.", "It is so bad that the largest employer in our community picked up and went to Quebec with a refinery and a smelter. Why? Because hydro rates there are cheaper in the public system that we have in Quebec. They specifically said, and they told the Premier to his face at a meeting here in the cabinet room that I attended, along with the city of Timmins, the union and others: “We are leaving Ontario because we can’t afford to pay the hydro rates.”", "So I will not be lectured by Liberals on that side of the House about hydro rates, because I can tell you that hydro rates, when we were in power, were much more reasonable.

I just think that we were right, as a House, when we all decided to support that. As a government, to put that particular private member’s motion into Bill 68 was exactly the right thing to do.", "As the mother of three and the grandmother of five little grandchildren, I have to say that that time of life when we are blessed to have a child is a pretty special time.

That stone was maybe a little bit of a hydro comment that I put out there this morning. Essentially, what I was talking about is tying it in to what municipalities are actually being faced with. To say that not improving or not working on the revenue tools that municipalities have been asking for is not in direct relation with the struggles that they are looking at with their infrastructure, with their arenas and with the services that they provide with revenue tools—why? Because a large portion of what they’re paying now is the increases on their hydro bills for these arenas and this infrastructure. How can you say that this isn’t related one to the other?", "Anyway, I want to thank the Minister of Municipal Affairs, the member from Huron–Bruce, the member from Timmins–James Bay and the Deputy Premier for their comments this morning.

Let’s look at restoring the provincial 50/50 share of the funding for municipal transit operations. That’s a step in the right direction. That’s being a partner. That’s what municipalities are asking for, paying one third of the cost for repairing school housing and social housing, which was downloaded onto them by the PC government and never reinstated by this Liberal government.", "That’s what partners do, and that’s what municipalities have been asking for: “Give us the tools that we need in order for us to thrive and to survive. Give us that opportunity, and we’ll step up, and we’re going to champion our communities. We know how to take care of our communities.” But we need an active partner, and right now this government is not responding to those needs and not responding to the requests of the many municipalities who have been asking for this for a long, long, long time." ],

The only thing I want to say about parental leaves: I wish it was included for women who lose their babies in pregnancy. In other words, a mother could carry a baby for eight months, lose that baby, and then she’s got to go back to work the next day. I think we’ve got to look at that too. They get no parental leave after a stillbirth or a late pregnancy loss. I would hope we would change that too in the future.", "In terms of this bill, it also gives municipalities the ability to better handle extreme weather events. As you know, it’s happening. We had the biggest rainfall here in Toronto a few years ago. Within an hour, more rain fell than fell in the whole season, causing massive flooding and damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So municipalities are given more resources and the wherewithal to deal with these extreme weather events, which are a reality.", "Also, it talks about the composition of regional councils. They’re very important because the regional councils take care of policing and EMS services across Ontario. They have asked for these changes.", "In terms of confidential meetings, there has always been a conundrum in municipalities of what is an in camera meeting. They have asked us to clarify it. In this legislation, there is an attempt to clarify and define exactly what an in camera meeting is about. These are some of the issues.", "It also allows municipalities—they have asked for this too—to appoint an integrity commissioner. We have one here, and many municipalities would like to do that too.", "Those are significant things that municipalities have asked for. I know people like to sort of minimize, sometimes, what municipalities do or that these issues are not important, but they are, because they are on the job 24/7, taking care of sewers, roads, transportation and parks. These are critical things. They don’t make CP24. They don’t talk about the sewer work that’s being done in a municipality. But the sewer work has to be done. Without good sewers, you can’t have a healthy, vibrant, working municipality. You can’t attract business without good sewers. These are things that sometimes are not given the attention they deserve.", "I also want to mention that one of the real challenges facing my municipality of Toronto—you can just imagine, Mr. Speaker—is that every year, about 100,000 new people come into Toronto—100,000, coming to Toronto every year. We have to find housing for them. We have to find schools for them. We have to find recreational programs. Some of them need social support. So you can imagine, every year, 100,000 that need support, in a local municipality like Toronto.", "That’s why, over the years, we’ve increased funding dramatically to municipalities. I think it’s up to $4 billion a year in programs. We’ve uploaded about $10 billion worth of costs back to the province that had been downloaded before.", "In terms of transit funding—I heard someone mention about getting back to 50/50. I don’t know if the member knows, but in Toronto, the largest crosstown public transit project in North America is 100% funded by the province of Ontario—100%. That’s the Eglinton Crosstown. It has never been done before. This government has done it: 100% funding by the provincial government. It’s a massive program that employs about 10,000 people and is building transit from Scarborough all the way to Etobicoke.", "As I said, there are many things that we could talk about in terms of the need to support our local municipalities. The main thing is that municipalities do the day-to-day work, but they need day-to-day support in terms of legislation, in terms of their ability to govern. These are things that have to go on constantly. There isn’t just one law you pass and it fixes all the day-to-day governance issues in municipalities.", "That’s why this Bill 68 is important as part of that ongoing collaboration with our local municipalities to make sure they can get their job done and build our sewers, our transit, take care of our mentally ill, and try to house people." ],

Like so many of my colleagues in the House, not only do I come from a municipal council background, so I have certainly followed this bill, the development of this bill, and discussion around this bill in the House very closely, but I have a personal perspective as well.", "Speaker, I go back many years and I think back to when I was just a little wee kid growing up in the beautiful hamlet of King City—800 people—in 1969. I was reminded of this the other day because I saw a painting by a well-known Ontario artist, Dorothy Clark McClure. The title of the painting was Clearing the Trees.", "What happened in 1969, in the bucolic hamlet of King township, King City, was that all of the beautiful sugar maples that lined Keele Street were cut down. The highway—the little Keele Street through King City, and King township road—was widened to four lanes.", "The town never recovered from that. It became a thoroughfare for gravel trucks and everyone trying to get over to Highway 400 and get down to Toronto, and our beautiful little town was gutted.", "I think about this and it angers me constantly because as a little kid, I remember my parents and their friends in the town talking to the local council, petitioning the local council and protesting at the local council, and at the regional level as well, to stop this, to create a bypass, to listen to the people who live in this beautiful little hamlet of 800 and stop the destruction of our historic downtown—to no avail. We were not listened to. I recall as a 10-year-old boy thinking to myself in those days, “This isn’t fair.”", "With that in the back of my mind, what I wanted to speak about for a few minutes now is the election of regional chairs, because the economic statement, the passage of Bill 70, amended the Municipal Act to require that all heads of regional council, except for Oxford county for very specific regions, be directly elected by voters starting with the 2018 municipal election. What I learned, starting back in 1969, is people need to be involved in politics and they need to have a greater say in their municipal politicians and municipal political life.", "At York region, as with a number of regions around Ontario, we never had a say in who ran the region, in who was the chair of the region. It’s one of the largest governments in Ontario, one of the governments with billions of dollars in debt and hundreds of millions of dollars in budget, and yet the people of York region had no direct say in who was the chair. The chair was selected by the councillors themselves, and there was always discussion and always suspicion that deals were being done, that regional chairs were being selected because they would make a deal with various regional councillors and mayors to give them certain things in return for being the chair.", "I think back to 1969 and I think to myself: That’s not the way it’s supposed to work. The average person on the street, members of the public, should be able to directly vote for who is going to head the second-tier government that oversees their own local municipalities.", "With that in mind, I moved a private member’s bill when I first arrived—my very first private member’s bill—but it followed on the heels of similar attempts by the members for Richmond Hill and Oak Ridges–Markham through previous governments that almost made it to the end but then, for whatever reason—government changed or there was an election—the bill was lost. That almost happened to mine, but thankfully, it was picked up by government because the government understands—and I had the support of all the parties to move it ahead. So it was picked up and moved ahead. I’m delighted that, starting in 2018, the good folks not only in York region but in many other regions across Ontario will have the ability to directly elect perhaps the most powerful political seat in their entire region, in their entire county.", "There are four regions that are affected by this amendment to the Municipal Act: York region, as I’ve mentioned; Peel region; Niagara region; and Muskoka district. There are a number of councils that already have elected chairs. I certainly spoke with them and members of their council, members of their municipal governments, to get their sense of how it was working, and those councils—Durham, Halton and Waterloo—told me that it was a really good thing to have the public participate in the direct election of the regional chair. In fact, I’ve heard from more than one directly elected regional chair who told me that it has actually now given them a stronger mandate in their position going forward. So that was a good thing.", "Again, just to go back—one of the things that I’m appreciative of under the Municipal Act is the direct election of regional chair. I think it makes everyone, as a politician, more accountable when you have to stand up every four years at least and talk directly to the people who are voting for you. You can explain your past decisions, you can explain your vision for the future, and the regular folk out there get a chance to say yes or no. So, if nothing more, I am supportive of this bill for the direct election of chairs.", "I will now pass the remainder of the time to my colleague." ],

C’est une législation qui est nécessaire pour permettre aux municipalités de faire ce qu’elles veulent faire et ce qu’elles doivent faire.", "This piece of legislation that is being proposed here reflects, indeed, the differences between municipalities, and it complements significant investments that are being made. I will speak on two issues of the bill that are, I think, particularly important to me: the increase in trust that’s going to be allowed by the reforms that are being proposed by having an integrity commissioner and also clarifying when the process meets in camera or not.", "This idea of improving the governance of municipalities goes hand in hand with the way in which this government supports an enhanced role for municipalities, recognizing that they are at the front line and they are the ones that are making day-to-day decisions that are very important to the people of Ontario.", "Indeed, I had the chance for the last two months to meet with several mayors from a range of municipalities from the north, last January and this weekend again, about their needs, particularly their needs on housing issues. We were looking at the significant investment that were possible now under the Ontario Community Infrastructure Fund, which is a permanent program which permits and will support and fund municipal roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.", "The more money that is in the system, the more accountability is needed to frame and ensure that good decisions are being made. This bill provides this. It provides reassurance to the people of Ontario that municipal decision-making will be framed in accountability measures that are necessary and that correspond to the modern framework of accountability and good governance that we now know.", "The other part that came up from this series of discussions with various mayors and representatives from municipalities is that they also wish to continue to have the tools that they need to address climate change and the range of possibilities that are now facing them. It’s a partnership to address climate change between the province and municipalities; we know that. It is important that the tools be distributed appropriately.", "I also had the chance to meet with the northern municipalities on discussing their housing issues and also the increased funding that will be made available with the doubling of funding of the return of the gas tax. This again precipitates a good discussion on what is needed to make good decisions.", "Let me address the two aspects of this bill that are necessary on the integrity front and on the good governance front that I think make sense.", "There’s no doubt that when you have a bill that is called the Modernizing Ontario’s Municipal Legislation Act, you expect that there will be an embrace of new forms of good governance that are well known, and this bill does exactly this. It uses the theme of integrity to ensure that municipalities make decisions that citizens can trust, and that there are no allegations or there’s the possibility of, if you have allegations of the misuse of money or a bad decision or a conflict of interest, that there is a forum for you to raise it appropriately. That’s an important part.", "In my past life as general counsel for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, we were always constantly approached by people who thought they had been badly treated by municipal councillors or had been shut out of meetings where an in camera meeting had been declared. I think what this bill does is provide some clarity about when it’s appropriate to go in camera, and then, when it’s not appropriate to go in camera, to ensure the transparency that is needed for citizens to trust that good decisions are made and that all the points of view have been considered. So I think this bill, in a way, moves us to a new era of good governance at the municipal level that we need to trust.", "I want to say that I think that this bill will be particularly welcome in my riding of Ottawa–Vanier because, again, it does provide a regime of trust and a regime of integrity that will continue to enhance the confidence that people in Ottawa–Vanier want to have about the municipal decisions that affect them. I know that people in my riding are very concerned about the way in which they want to have some refurbishment of Montreal Road, which is right in my riding. That’s where my constituency office is. We know we need it badly. I know this will allow people to have trust that the investments that are being made, that are now available to municipalities, are transparently decided and transparently made for all the people in the riding.", "I want to conclude by also mentioning a few points about parental leave. I think this bill brings municipal governance into the 21st century by recognizing that parental leave is needed, so that we ensure that our municipal leaders are indeed reflective of all segments of society. It’s important for our good governance to not have artificial barriers to prevent women from participating fully in the governance structure of Ontario. Municipal councils are one of them, so the idea that this actually speaks to parental leave, which was an issue that’s raised often when we look at the difficulty for women to enter politics—I think it is a good thing to have in this bill.", "I am supporting this bill for these two reasons, because it does reflect the need for women’s participation in politics, and also because it increases the level of trust that will be available for municipal decision-making." ],

Obviously, Ontario is a very big province with many different kinds of municipalities, Speaker. Ottawa has almost one million people, but alas, when you look outside of the city, there are very many small municipalities, much, much smaller than our big city. Obviously, I would hope that this act would take that into consideration.", "A couple of other specific problems that we have identified with the bill in the Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus are that it conflicts with the finance bill. On the same day the Minister of Municipal of Affairs introduced this bill, the Minister of Finance actually introduced Bill 70, which required direct election of regional chairs and actually amends the exact same sections of the Municipal Act. So I think the government has got to get itself under control.", "The municipal elections bill passed last June, Bill 181, the Municipal Elections Modernization Act, dealing with municipal elections.

I would hope that there will be some clarification, something coming forward around that piece, so that it would not just be due to pregnancy but would actually include if a city councillor adopts a child. When you bring a child into your home, adopt a child, there is an adjustment period. It’s the same as giving birth to a child. You still need to be there to care for that child, to bond with that child. The needs aren’t any different. So I would hope that there is going to be some provision in the bill to allow for leave due to adoption.", "The other piece that I hope will be taken into consideration, should this make it to committee, is that this speaks specifically to municipalities, so we’re talking about city councillors or mayors or wardens or whatever you call them in your particular region. What it doesn’t address is school board trustees. Often people forget—including the government, frankly—that school board trustees are also elected officials. They run in municipal elections, along with our city councillors and our mayors. They are elected officials, and they deserve the same respect as those that are elected to our city councils.", "I hope that the government will take that into account in committee and add that school boards must allow for parental leave—I’d rather call it “parental leave” than “leave due to pregnancy”—that they will allow for parental leave, because there are rules in the Education Act that govern how much time a trustee can miss from their duties." ],

And so it is the case with the Ontario Municipal Act and its companion, the City of Toronto Act.", "In the matter of having an integrity commissioner available to municipalities, I think that’s an important one. It isn’t so much that the integrity commissioner comes down on an elected member as that an elected member knows, if he or she has a question about something, that they can pick up the phone and call the integrity commissioner in complete confidence and say, “I just want to discuss with you the following thing in the municipal arena”—it might pertain to land development; it might pertain to an industry that is planning to move in or out—“and I just want to know what the limits are on this.”", "As you work with people, you get to know them, and you never want to step outside the boundary of what’s right and proper. But having that integrity commissioner there, to be able to pick up the phone and to ask, is often a very handy thing. Probably the best problems to solve are the ones that never occur in the first place, and one of the best ways to ensure that a problem never occurs is to have someone available to provide you professional, impartial, and confidential counsel. It gives an elected member the confidence to pick up the phone and to ask, and to resolve a problem before it becomes an issue." ],

I think there is a very big gap between what is expected of that person and what is actually physically possible. I look in my own communities where there is significant growth in the population. With just that come more pieces of red tape, more issues and challenges that municipal councillors face in looking after this explosion that takes place.", "I recall having conversations with individuals who have called because I’m an elected person, even though on a different level of government, on things like, “How much family time does this take?

As I said, the ability to deal with extreme weather events—that is a reality: flooding, hydro issues, transit sinkholes that are happening. There’s another one here in Toronto. There’s a big one in Ottawa. These extreme events happen, and municipalities want to be able to deal with those events. That’s what this bill deals with.", "Also, I just wanted to mention one thing that is in this bill which I support, and that is the parental leave and maternity leave for elected officials. As I said previously, it boggles the mind why we haven’t allowed or put in legislation that gives maternity leave or parental leave for women who experience pregnancy loss or stillbirths. If they carry a baby for nine months, eight months and unfortunately lose the baby, they have to go back to work the next day—no protection from employment, no protection from the government.", "I know we’re doing it for municipal councillors, and that’s fantastic, but what about the over 100,000 women every year who go through pregnancy loss? We should also have protections in place for them. Give them some maternity leave. They shouldn’t have to go back to work after carrying a baby and losing that baby.

I want to try to limit my comments to two specific sections which I find the most concerning, quite frankly, and I want to underline that many of the issues that I’ve heard have come directly from individuals in Dufferin–Caledon who currently serve on council, or even the experts in the field, as I like to call them, the clerks and treasurers who are the support for our various regional governments, county governments and municipal governments.", "Let’s start with section 268. This section would allow that the council of a local municipality—we would often call that the lower-tier municipality—“may appoint one of its members as an alternate member of the upper-tier” municipality. I’ll give you an example. In the county of Dufferin, we have the county of Dufferin and we have eight municipalities: Orangeville, Amaranth, Shelburne, Grand Valley—you get the idea.", "In effect, what this section would mean is: An issue comes forward that is directly related and impacts the town of Shelburne. The town of Shelburne says, “Hey, you council rep, you mayor, you deputy mayor, we don’t want you to go today to county council. We’re going to put George in, because George has a particular interest in this issue.” So you have, in effect, this moving table at the county level or the regional table where you can move people up for specific issues. I’m very concerned about that section and, frankly, I would love to have some government member explain to me the justification for it, because it can very much impact what happens at the county or the regional level.", "As you all know, county councillors and regional councillors are assigned particular roles. When they go and they are part of the upper level of government—the regional or the county level—they become chairs of the public works, of social services. They have specific responsibilities. Their responsibilities are not related to the community that they directly serve.", "When you move to the regional level, when you move to the county level, you are there for all of the community. You are not there as an Orangeville representative or as a Mono representative; you are there as a Dufferin county representative. So I would love to have some explanation as to why that amendment has been put in, because many individuals in my community who serve at the upper level are wondering what the justification, what the reasoning, for that is.", "The second thing is related to electronic participation. This is section 238 of the act, as amended, by adding the following subsection:", "“The applicable procedure bylaw may provide that a member of council, of a local board or of a committee of either of them, can participate electronically in a meeting which is open to the public to the extent and in the manner set out in the bylaw provided that any such member shall not be counted in determining whether” there is a quorum, but they can vote.", "This is what I’m now calling the mail-it-in amendment. I know many members spend a lot of time in their car over the weekend, attending events. I do—far too much time in my car. If you are a CBC listener, there is a radio program on Saturdays called This Is That. It’s satire. I’m going to underline that: It’s satire.", "Many months ago, the program This Is That had a news feature that talked about how the federal government was going to allow MPs to electronically vote on legislation that was happening at the federal level. This is satire. It was actually quite funny. It was 10 or 15 minutes, and they were mock-interviewing MPs who said, “Oh, yeah, it would be great if I could stay in my bathtub or hot tub and then vote on the amendment as it came forward,” and on and on it went.", "Lo and behold, the next day, I’m at another event and a constituent comes up to me and he says, “Sylvia, I am so offended that the federal government is actually considering allowing MPs to vote in and not have to attend to their duties in Ottawa.”", "I’m in a very uncomfortable position to explain to the individual that in fact it was satire, and no, the federal government is not going to allow it. Well, guess what? We’re allowing it with Bill 68. How foolish. The whole part of this debate, the whole part of why we participate here in this chamber, is to hear the other side, to listen to the debates, to try to convince people that this amendment is going to cause problems.", "Back to the This Is That satire program: Canada is fairly large. Ontario is fairly large. We have 444 municipalities in the province of Ontario. We are not expecting our municipal representatives to travel for two and a half days to get to their centre of government, participate in debates and vote on legislation or, in their case, bylaws.", "Please, please, please explain to me why we need the mail-it-in amendment. I don’t like it, as you can probably tell. I don’t understand why it’s there. As the warden of one of my counties explained to me, they already have the ability, in an emergency situation, to have a discussion, to have an executive decision, to have a committee move forward on things when there is an emergency in their municipality. Please don’t tell me that this is to ensure that, when we have a tornado or we have heavy flooding, this will allow the municipal government to continue, because that’s not the case. We already have that in place. That ability is already there under our municipal government.", "I would love for the government to remove the mail-it-in amendment. I do not see the value of it. I do not see what you’re trying to solve. What are you trying to improve? What are you trying to fix? What are we trying to fix with that particular amendment to section 238? I don’t understand. I don’t see it. I have yet to have a municipal representative who isn’t saying tongue-in-cheek that they need that mail-it-in amendment. It’s not appropriate. Part of what we have as a responsibility is to come to consensus.", "Often when I talk at schools and to people about the various differences between the municipal, provincial and federal levels of government, I try to explain that municipally, historically and generally, people don’t affiliate themselves with a particular party system. Part of that is because municipal government tends to base its decisions on finding some common ground. Provincially and federally we do it much more along party affiliations. At the municipal level, what we try to do is not have those, “I’m always going to vote with this bloc of individuals. I am always going to vote with this bloc of people.” If we do not have the individual councillors sitting around the council table and hearing the other side, we’re not going to have that.", "What they’re going to do is, on Friday night, they’re going to review their council package, they’re going to go through it and they’re going to put an “S” or an “O” behind every amendment—potential bylaw. They’re not going to listen to the other council members explain their side. They’re not going to hear from the public, who often appear at council—in person, I might add, Speaker. They don’t get to mail it in. They appear in front of council to explain why they support or oppose a particular bylaw or amendment change. They’re just going to mail it in and either call or have the computer set up so that they can just say “support” or “oppose.”", "I don’t think that any of us wants that to happen at the municipal level. I certainly don’t want to have it happen at the federal level, notwithstanding how funny the This Is That satire program was on it.", "I grant that the timing is coming to an end, but if I can finish with: If we could have the mail-it-in amendment removed, I would be very happy." ],

As a northernmost refuge for the slaves fleeing the southern states, Owen Sound and the village of Sydenham were the last terminal of the railroad where many of them escaped, eventually settling down to work and raise families.", "After a long and difficult journey to freedom, escaped slaves experienced continuing challenges. Insecurity and uncertainty in border cities often propelled people to move further north into Ontario, or what later would become Ontario. John Hall, one of Grey county’s most prominent early black citizens, was born in Amherstburg, Ontario, sometime in the late 1700s and was captured as a young man during the War of 1812. Ultimately, Hall passed into slavery. After 13 years as a slave, he escaped by the Underground Railroad to southern Ontario, later making his way to the Durham and Rocky Saugeen area in the 1840s. He then moved to Owen Sound, living a long life there, where he was well known as the town crier. Hall died in 1900.", "Robert Sutherland, Canada’s first black lawyer as well as the first-known university student and graduate of colour in Canada, was called to the bar in 1855.

The NDP has no problem with that. If there’s agreement on both sides—from the employer side and from the union side—that makes sense. However, the bill includes many more changes, and many of them are divisive. I would even say many of them have been polarized already, and we all know where that will lead: That will lead to undermining future rounds of bargaining, and nothing good will come of that.", "Let’s face it, Speaker, there was a complete lack of consensus during the stakeholder consultation to develop these amendments. The time, the effort, the energy were never put into making sure that all the groups found common ground. There were a lot of ideas that were shared and there were a lot of requests that were made, but never the time, the effort, the energy to try to move it to the next level, to the level where we can start to develop broad consensus, to the level where you’re ready to live with what’s there—although it’s not exactly what you wanted, but you’re ready to live with it. None of that work was done.", "The government basically went ahead and did what it has always done: put forward its own idea, because apparently they have all of the good ideas in the world. They’re all on that side of the House, and none of us have any good ones. Well, we all know that that’s not true. In this particular bill, there were a lot of good ideas that were put forward by the different stakeholders who took part. Very few of them were actually listened to.", "What matters more than the structure within the collective bargaining is how the parties interact with each other at the bargaining table. We all know that collaborative bargaining is what brings us the best collective agreements, brings us labour peace, brings us—in this particular instance—good classrooms where our children have an opportunity to learn from teachers, educational assistants, etc., or even the people who clean and support the schools in an environment that is conducive to learning at their best.", "I want to give some examples of those ideas that were shared but completely ignored. I’ll start with l’Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens, AEFO. The AEFO has made the government aware of many ideas for change. Many important lessons were learned from Bill 122, and they wanted change.", "For example, in this bill, Bill 92, the government intends to force unions representing support staff—they are the secretaries, the teachers’ aides, the computer technicians etc.—to become members of provincial negotiation organizations. However, as its members’ bargaining agent, AEFO already represents them in an official and exclusive capacity. Why is it that the government would bring forward something like this when they already knew that it was going to be problematic?", "They ask that any amendment to the act should lead to a more efficient process. I’m quoting directly from their president, Rémi Sabourin, who says, “There is no need to make it more cumbersome than it already is.”", "AEFO, like many other stakeholder unions and employers, is carefully reviewing the government-proposed changes.", "J’aimerais également parler un peu d’autres préoccupations de l’Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens. Non seulement sont-ils préoccupés par le fait qu’ils ne représentent pas seulement le personnel enseignant, mais ils représentent également du personnel de soutien pour les enseignants et tous ceux qui travaillent dans nos écoles scolaires, dans nos écoles francophones, que ce soit avec le conseil scolaire catholique ou public.", "Les Franco-Ontariens et Franco-Ontariennes se sont battus pendant très longtemps pour venir à bout d’avoir, dans un premier temps, nos écoles francophones, et dans un deuxième temps, la gouvernance de ces écoles. Finalement, on en est venu à bout, et on en est très fier.", "Là, le gouvernement libéral arrive avec ses gros sabots, puis dit, « On aura une table de négociation centrale. » Ça se fait dans bien d’autres secteurs. Moi, je viens du secteur de la santé. Je peux vous dire que, du côté des infirmières du côté de la santé, ça se fait assez régulièrement. Mais lorsque tu mets une table de négociation centrale—lorsque tu es en train de négocier une convention collective, le langage est au coeur de tes travaux. Le langage qui va être utilisé dans la convention collective va être lu, relu et analysé jusqu’à temps qu’on s’entende tous sur ce qu’on a voulu dire.", "Les enseignants et enseignantes francophones et les syndicats qui les représentent vont être à une table de négociation anglophone.

Peu importe comment bons ou bonnes seront les traducteurs, il y aura toujours place à l’interprétation.", "Vous savez ce qui fait une bonne convention collective, monsieur le Président? C’est quand tu ne laisses pas de place à l’interprétation.

Bill 92 will take something that used to be optional—so the different school boards, the different unions could decide to participate in central bargaining or they could decide not to participate in central bargaining. I can tell you that in the last round of negotiations, the NDP fought really hard to make sure that the French unions representing French schools within French boards had an opportunity to do the central bargaining in French. We thought we had won that battle, you see, Speaker, but then Bill 92 comes back out, and it’s like none of that had ever existed. It’s like all of the hundreds of years that francophones worked to gain the right to have French schools and then to gain the right to manage those schools and then to govern those schools—all of this doesn’t count, all of a sudden?

What does that mean? That means that French teachers in French schools with French unions, French directors of schools and French boards will have to work with an English collective agreement.", "Why? Why would the Liberals put forward something like this? Not only is it disrespectful; we know that it’s going to lead to more grievances. We know that it’s going to lead to more problems on the ground because, on the ground, those collective agreements are not written to collect dust. Those collective agreements are written so that this is the way that labour and management manage the day-to-day operations. Everything that is written in those collective agreements will have meanings that have to be understood by everybody who reads them. Once you have a translated document, I’m sorry: It doesn’t matter how good the translator is; you will have issues.", "Why would the government put something like that forward when they already knew that this was an issue, when they had already been warned that they needed to accommodate the fact that we have francophone school boards and we have French schools in Ontario, and they have a right to have French collective agreements because this is their language of work, and this is the language that everybody speaks—except for the Liberal government, which says, “No. We’re going to have central bargaining for all of our schools. We’ll handle this little francophone issue when we have time, just not right now. Don’t bother us too much.” Can you see a little bit of disrespect in this, Mr. Speaker? I certainly can.", "I was giving this as one example of a bill that basically was supposed to make corrections to the previous bill, Bill 122, where everybody had agreed that, after a round of negotiations, they would go back and do changes to the legislation. One of the changes that everybody seemed to agree to is that if both parties agree, they could extend current collective agreements. That’s fine; this is contained in the bill. But pretty much everything else that is contained in the bill has not been worked through, has winners and losers. This, in bargaining, is a non-starter. Bargaining is made by human beings. We all behave at the bargaining table like human beings. That could come as a surprise to people, but this is the way it goes. You want the rules of the game to be fair, to be understood and to make sense. You do this by making sure that you take the time to talk to the different parties and find the common ground. This bill shows no effort in finding common ground. Actually, this bill goes out of its way to find things that are polarizing and that have no consensus.", "I will look at one of them. It says that all education work bargaining units must participate in central bargaining following the 2017 round. Currently, collective bargaining for agreements under the act “may include central bargaining, but is not required to include it.” So before, you could if you wanted to; now, you will have to, no matter what the French board or the French unions representing the French teachers have to say.", "It goes on to say, “For the purposes of central bargaining, every school board must be represented by an employer bargaining agency and every employee in a bargaining unit must be represented by an employee bargaining agency.” Again, we know from the start that this does not work for the French unions. They represent both: They represent the teachers and they represent the support staff. Why do you put forward in a bill something that does not work on the ground before figuring things out? I thought the entire idea behind the negotiation last summer was to find common ground, but then we see things like this.", "We also see things like a five-day notice being required in the event of full withdrawal of service, including instruction or lockout, in “one or more schools of a board, or the closure of one or more schools of a board.” This is in addition to the five days’ notice currently required under the act. I don’t remember anybody having consensus on that. Certainly, the people who participated in the consultation last summer did not agree and did not give the okay to such a thing.", "I’m not saying that what’s in the bill is good or what’s in the bill is bad. I’m saying that if this is a bill that is going to set the stage for further collective bargaining—at this point, we are not bargaining. I’m not here to bargain. I leave this to people who know what they’re doing and have skin in the game. But if we’re going to set the rules as to how bargaining is going to take place, we should make sure that those rules are built from the ground up. We should make sure that those rules are not problematic from the start, because in French we say, “On va s’enfarger dans les fleurs du tapis.” How would we translate that in English? I’m not too sure. But it basically means, if you don’t have good ground rules, you will trip over the flowers printed on the carpet. You’re not even going to make it to the negotiations table. You will already have issues because you have a bill that is, according to the government, intent on improving and streamlining the collective bargaining process, but that in reality brings a lot of divisive issues and makes decisions on a lot of issues that are polarized, and has not been well thought through.", "This is the third rendition of how collective agreements should be done in our education system. You would figure that after trial two—so everybody remembers the infamous Bill 115. Then there was Bill 122, and now there’s Bill 92 and we’re still not there. We still have a lot of issues that are not resolved that will make bargaining difficult. It is exactly the opposite of what the bill’s intention is supposed to be.", "I thank you for your time.

I can tell you, I’ve been an MPP almost 10 years.

Not only for those kids that are sometimes three and a half, four years old and fall asleep in the hour-and-a-half bus ride—it means that those kids are not ready to learn. They’re tired; they hate school; they hate the whole thing. But for the community, after the school goes, the next one is the grocery store. Then comes the pharmacy. Then the village self-implodes because no young families will move to a community that does not have a school.", "This place out in Nickel Belt: Every single year I look at Long Lake, where the school has closed, has been bulldozed over. I look at Our Lady of Fatima in Naughton, which has lost its school. Every year it’s the same thing. We have the school review, and the big urban school wins and the little community loses.

I’m going to take about 10 minutes to talk about this bill because I got elected back in 2003 as a school board trustee. I was young at the time. I had a sense of idealism. The world—I wanted to make it a better place. I really wanted to do that because the board, the Toronto District School Board back then, was still under supervision. When I was elected as a school board trustee, our school board was under supervision. I think it was Mr. Christie who was the supervisor. He was appointed by the former Conservative government.", "Back then, public education was in crisis. It was in crisis for so many years. In fact, if you came down to the Legislature on any given day—it could be on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday; it didn’t matter what day—this entire building was surrounded at some point. It could be in the morning, in the afternoon or in the evening. There were people down here protesting the current government. I decided I wanted to get involved in public education because of the need for change within the education system.", "Back then, in 2003, when we first came into government, one out of every three young people in this province did not graduate from high school. I want you to think about that for a second. That’s almost 33%. It was actually 32%. It was a 68% graduation rate at the time. Today, it’s 85.5%.", "Think about this: We have the Conservatives on the other side talking about fuelling the economy. We have them talking about building a better tomorrow. But when they were given an opportunity to govern our most valuable resource—our young children here in the province of Ontario—one out of three did not graduate.", "So it’s really interesting to sit here in this Legislature, coming from the Toronto District School Board, coming from that type of space where I saw the direct effects of a Harris government, of a Conservative government—to stand in the Legislature today to listen to the Conservatives talk about education.

Because it allows us to provide opportunity for our young people to get out there and help build the economy. It will help them get into post-secondary education. It will allow them to build lives here in the province of Ontario that we’ve all been afforded to build: to build a family, to be able to have—the member from Nepean said a few days ago, “All we want is to be able to pay our mortgage and to take care of our families.” That’s what public education does. It allows young people to have the opportunity to go into post-secondary, into a trade—to college or university, wherever they want to go—and to build a life for themselves.", "I am so proud of this government’s record when it comes to public education, based on the stability we’ve been able to bring through the collective bargaining process here in the province of Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, I want you to listen to these numbers. This, I think, addresses the stability that I am talking about here in Ontario. Since 2003, here in the province of Ontario, this government, this Liberal government, has increased educational funding by 59%, despite declining enrolment. When I was at the board, I think we started off at 260,000 students. By the time I left, it was below 250,000 students. The numbers went down drastically, and that happened right across the province. Despite the fact there was declining enrolment in the province of Ontario, we moved public, per-pupil funding from $4,500 to $11,709, an increase of 63%. When the Conservatives were in power, they were making cuts to public education. When we were in power, even with declining enrolment, there was a 63% increase in educational funding per pupil.", "Mr. Speaker, the most important thing—I led by talking about graduation rates, and I need to say this one more time, because this bill will bring stability into the collective bargaining process. It will create more transparency, flexibility and fairness within the system. It will allow for our students to succeed. But when we have an Ontario where one in three young people fails school, to me it’s completely unacceptable. We know the Conservatives from many failures in the past. When it comes to the sell-off of the 407, that’s a failure. You know what? Governments make mistakes. We saw in transit—we saw the Conservatives fill in the subway lines that we started to dig in Toronto. But you know what? It’s okay. People make mistakes. Governments make mistakes.", "Mr. Speaker, we saw a lack of investment in health care and education. We saw a lack of investment in infrastructure. There are certain mistakes in the province of Ontario that you could never forgive, and when one in three young people in this province don’t have the opportunity to graduate high school and build a life for themselves, it is a complete failure. It is the best measurement we can use to understand if a government has done well or if it’s done poorly.", "There’s no question in my mind that the Conservative government here in Ontario under the former Minister Eves, who became the Premier, and Mike Harris, was a complete failure when it comes to public education. I believe that this government is best positioned, through this piece of legislation, to help build an Ontario that we can all be proud of by ensuring that our young people have a fair chance to make it here in the province of Ontario by getting the right type of education and having the ability to build the type of life that they deserve." ],

It is sometimes heartbreaking. It is emotional. It is potentially divisive and most definitely contentious. It’s Bill 84, the medical assistance in dying statute law.", "In preparation for the debate today, I did, obviously, some research, and I will lean heavily on the speech and the leadoff made by our health critic, the member from Nickel Belt, France Gélinas, who did a really tremendous job at highlighting some of the omissions in the bill, some of the items that need further attention and some of the inadequacies.", "At the outset, I would say that this is, obviously, a very important bill and most definitely timely for us to be debating in the House given that federal legislation brought in last year requires us to have a framework in response to the federal changes to the Criminal Code in respect to medical assistance in dying. It’s one that I think is important for us to contemplate, but more so it’s important for us to very, very clearly understand the will of our communities in the context of this bill.", "Again, from the notes that I was able to learn from, from our colleague from Nickel Belt, we see that the government didn’t really do a great job in listening to the communities and listening to health care practitioners and leaders in palliative care and end-of-life care. It’s our hope that through the process of this bill the government finds a mechanism to open up the doors again to public consultation, not just simply through committee, but through transparency and accountability and communication—broad communication through whatever measure possible. Because from what we’re hearing in our communities—and I’m certain that members have received letters and emails about this bill and about the issue—there is still wide disagreement and contention on both sides. It is a polarizing issue, and one that—if done correctly, the hope is that it can address the various outstanding questions that continue to exist.", "Before I get there, I’d like to offer some suggestions to the government, and one that I think is born out of the need of our community to address not only end-of-life care and medical assistance in dying, but the process of health care in our communities and that continuity of care that we all hope exists from birth to death.", "We know that in our communities, each and every day, people struggle to find access to long-term care and are absolutely having a terrible time accessing home care, which is a strategy put forward by the Liberal government without the adequate resources that our communities require. In fact, it was as if they threw the tag line “home care” at the wall, hoped that it stuck and hoped that private industry would fill the gap when, in fact, the way to deliver appropriate and adequate home care is with comprehensive government intervention, action and planning. What we see are large gaps in home care, long-term care and also palliative care that exist across the province.", "Just look at a map of this province. It’s spectacular. It’s daunting. Look at northern Ontario. I mean, it’s just massive in its scope. And the people that we have to remember and serve here are communities in rural Ontario that are remote and even still struggle with these issues, but yet still require the same level of service.", "The challenges for our government and us as legislators is to understand that those resources have to be prioritized because it aids the overall system and it gets us to a clearer focal point on what we’re talking about today: the medical assistance in dying statute law.", "We know that we need to improve access to palliative care and hospice care. As I mentioned, there are many communities that simply do not have access. In the remarks made by our colleague from Nickel Belt, she presented some stories around folks who would have to travel hundreds of kilometres to access hospice care and the fact that palliative doctors just simply do not exist to provide referrals that are embedded in the requirements of accessing medical assistance in dying. That’s an enormous challenge. How in fact can we have the active mechanisms when those doctors simply don’t exist? That has yet to be addressed in the bill.", "We need, and frankly people in our communities deserve, improved home care. Every day in our community, in Essex, my office, our community office, receives calls from families who are struggling, many times in crisis situations, emergent health care situations that require a loved one to receive immediate long-term care and access to long-term care. The problem is, Speaker, that it simply does not exist. There are no stopgap measures.", "We do know where some of those stopgap measures have been created. They are created in the wards of our emergency hospital rooms, where patients are stacked up in hallways, and emergency rooms are overcrowded, because that pathway into long-term care just simply doesn’t exist.", "So when we’re talking about that transition and the fluidity from long-term care into hospice care and palliative care, we have to ensure that there is continuity of that care. We would impress upon the government that they have not done enough. The examples are abundant in our communities to prove that point.", "We also need to support our health care professionals and make sure that they have the resources available to provide health care services, not only chronic and acute health care services but these very specialized end-of-life treatment plans and treatment protocols. I’m not exactly sure of the amount of palliative doctors that we have in the province, but I can tell you that it’s finite, and I can imagine that, with an aging demographic, it’s most definitely not enough. This bill doesn’t do anything to ensure that we have those resources and that we are funnelling and training enough doctors to get into this field, and that they have the support from the government to be able to provide that service.", "Speaker, if we look at the overall system under the Liberal government, glaring attacks and glaring hits to the system have taken place. Over 1,500 nursing positions have been cut in our local hospitals in the last two years. That’s front-line care. You walk in, you get triaged and you get care. Those nurses do not exist any longer in our communities.", "For four straight years, provincial health care dollars have been frozen. Those budgets for hospitals like Windsor, Leamington and across the province have been frozen. So they’ve had to struggle with increased levels of patients coming in and more complex needs for those hospitals with a stagnant budget. That’s practically impossible to do—and all along, being mandated to not be able to run budgetary deficits through their hospitals. How do you do that? Well, you cut back on staffing, you cut back on beds and you cut back on those essential services that we’ve all come to know and require in our hospitals. The effect is ultimately that people in our community suffer. That’s the legacy that we have under the Liberal government.", "Those issues have to be addressed within the context of any parameters of health care at the exact same time. There’s no reason why they can’t and there’s no reason why they shouldn’t.", "Again, this bill essentially provides Ontario with the legal framework to respond to the changes in federal legislation, the changes that were made to the Criminal Code. It has some pretty technical effects to it in that it amends six pieces of legislation to implement what is Ontario’s legal framework for medical assistance in dying. It amends the Coroners Act to clarify the role of the provincial coroner. It amends the Excellent Care for All Act to ensure that the fact that a person is receiving medical assistance in dying cannot be invoked as a reason to deny or refuse a benefit that would otherwise be provided under a contract or a statute. It amends the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act and the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. It amends the Vital Statistics Act and regulation 1094 under the act, and it also amends the workplace health and safety act to ensure that workers who are covered under WSIB benefits don’t lose those benefits within the process of accessing medical assistance in dying.", "But again, I’ll point back to what my colleague Madame Gélinas from Nickel Belt informed this House about in that this process, of course, was as a result of federal legislation coming out last year, but the unfolding of the bill and the process left a lot to be desired in terms of its consultation with the broader public and stakeholders that are directly involved in this issue.", "One issue that she pointed to was that other provinces have done this and passed similar legislation to respond to the federal Criminal Code changes, but they’ve done it in a way that brought in community stakeholders and did incredible consultation through the mechanisms of select committees. L’assemblée nationale du Québec, which of course is the equivalent of our Legislature here in the province, started this process back in 2009, anticipating that this was a legislative change that was happening in other jurisdictions. They started the process in 2009 with consultations. They put together a select committee in the Legislature. It’s something that, as New Democrats, we’ve asked this minister and the government to do.", "The select committee travelled, as they do. They had consultations with experts in the field. They listened to best practices. They travelled abroad, Speaker. They went to France and Belgium and the Netherlands to learn about what medical assistance in dying meant there and how they addressed the contentious issues. They held 51 deliberate meetings with committee members. They consulted with 32 experts and they made 33,200 copies of their consultation paper. They listened to 273 briefs; 239 individuals and organizations were heard. They held 29 days of public hearings throughout their province, and 114 individuals were heard during the open-mike period. Some 6,558 people answered their questionnaire, and they received 16,000 comments by email, fax or online questionnaire.", "Guess how much consultation the province did?" ],

It’s one that requires us to be diligent and to be transparent in the process, but one that should also compel us to look at the larger issues that exist in our health care system that bring people through this process.", "When the member from Ottawa Centre spoke last week, he was eloquent in his speech and compassionate, and he invoked the compassion and the sensitivity that this issue requires. Something that stood out for me when he spoke about the bill was that end-of-life treatment should be looked at no differently than beginning-of-life treatment, and that the resources that are available and expected in our health care system should be on the same level.", "I hope that this bill gets us there, but it will not if we don’t address some of the outlying issues that continue to exist that exacerbate people’s chronic health issues when they’re in their elderly years or if they have chronic health issues that are insurmountable. There are mechanisms for us to do that. It requires a government that prioritizes those resources and is able to make the case and to present it to us, and to infuse some more trust into the process once again. Because as we see it in our communities, when our hospitals rooms are stacked up, when people can’t find access to long-term care, when home care services are fragmented and when the providers are out to simply make a profit and treat their home care workers with disrespect—they certainly are overworked and underpaid; at $16 an hour to provide a loved one with that vital type of care, you can imagine that you’re going to have a high level of turnover in your workforce.", "Something that I think should be fundamental to this government—I know they’ll say that this is an evolving issue and one that requires continuous effort on behalf of the government to look at, but it should be an integral part of this type of legislation and one that should be addressed by the government to ensure that communities understand that it’s an overall plan, one that brings us closer to that continuity of care in our communities so that we can be assured in our final days that those resources are there and that they’ve been thoroughly thought out and planned for, to avoid the emotional hardship that these issues can bring upon families in our communities.", "Speaker, I thank you so much for the time.

He recognized very clearly that this is a response to federal legislation, that we have to find a way to implement those directives from the federal government—the courts, particularly—in order to get this right, that it may not be the perfect solution yet and is still somewhat a work in progress. I felt that he was taking a very non-partisan, balanced approach to this. I appreciated that until, of course, he got into some of the partisan issues that he started to drift into, but I think he pulled them back.", "Particularly when he starts talking about stagnant budgets for four years in hospitals in his neighbourhood, we know that every hospital in the province of Ontario has received increased funding every year over the last four years. So I would encourage him to stick to those kinds of realities when discussing. There are more nurses being hired. They may not be all in the same institutional places where they were, but they are in the communities and there are opportunities.", "I particularly appreciated his comments around northern Ontarians’ concerns on this legislation.

This is an extremely challenging, sensitive and critically important subject we’re debating. I sense from the discussion that we’re looking at it from our various perspectives, but the intent of all my colleagues, I know, is to work towards creating a piece of legislation that is as strong and defensible as it can be and puts into place those measures not only to comply with the federal legislation, which all of the provinces and territories are responding to, but also to provide confidence to Ontarians: confidence with regard to access and confidence to those health care professionals who, for whatever reason—it might be religious beliefs; it might be an issue of conscience—decide not to participate.", "We need to ensure there’s an appropriate balance: that for those, with their loved ones, who might choose this path for themselves, their rights and requirements are appropriately met, and, at the same time, we respect the constitutionally protected, charter-protected rights of Canadians to also have their religious and conscience rights respected on an issue of such vital importance. So I’m pleased to add my comments this afternoon as we continue to discuss Bill 84.", "I wanted to begin by taking us back to how we arrived at this place today. As we know, the legislation that I introduced late last year and that we’re discussing today and we’re debating would support the implementation of medical assistance in dying in this province, medical assistance in dying which is already, to varying extents, taking place across this country, including in this province.", "This bill, importantly, would provide more protection and greater clarity in the implementation of medical assistance in dying for this province’s patients, for their families and for our health care providers. As I’ll outline a little later, the bill, as we’ve proposed it, we believe aligns fully with federal legislation involving medical assistance in dying. That legislation was enacted as a result of a Supreme Court of Canada decision in a case that challenged what was, at that time, a prohibition on the process and involvement of health care practitioners—or others, for that measure—in the matter of assisted dying.", "I’d like to begin by providing you a little bit of background. As I think by now most of us know, the Supreme Court of Canada issued its decision on Carter v. Canada almost two years ago—in fact, slightly more than two years ago—on February 6, 2015. In the Carter decision, the court unanimously struck down the Criminal Code prohibition against physician-assisted dying for a competent adult person who clearly consents to the termination of his or her life, possesses a grievous and irremediable medical condition and is enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition. That is the basis of the Supreme Court making the decision they did in that important decision, which of course already has had profound implications in this country.", "The Supreme Court also decided to suspend its decision for a total of 16 months to allow for both federal, provincial and territorial governments and regulatory bodies, should they so choose, to begin to develop an appropriate response of their own, including potentially enacting legislation consistent with the decision, legislation similar to the legislation that we’re debating today, Mr. Speaker.", "During this time, our government led a process with the other provinces and territories to engage and consult with key stakeholders in the general public, with Canadians, on this complex and personal issue, and to make recommendations. In fact, it was this government and this province that took the lead in reaching out to the provinces and territories in the absence of action by the then Harper government. The provinces and territories were concerned, because of the Supreme Court decision, that we needed to take steps of our own to canvass the population and to meet and consult with our stakeholders to begin to determine what steps, what processes, what safeguards and what confidence-building measures Ontario needed to put in place in order for us to proceed when that time came, as it has, for the implementation of medical assistance in dying.", "So we did that. We created a panel of eminent persons from right across this country, including several of them from Ontario. They spent a significant period of time, as I mentioned, consulting with Canadians. We, separate from that expert panel at the time, consulted widely with Ontarians as well through a whole variety of forums. They made their recommendations, which have served us well, despite and alongside the federal activity on this issue, to help really guide us as to what legislation from the province would be most appropriate.", "Following that 16-month suspension by the Supreme Court in their declaration in Carter, the federal government then went ahead and passed Bill C-14, which came into force in June of last year. That federal legislation importantly provides a consistent and national framework to support the implementation of MAID. It addresses issues of appropriateness and eligibility. It addresses the issue of access as well and the requirement to provide this service to those who request it. It also importantly addresses the issue of objection, a religious, moral or conscience objection by those health care providers. Those safeguards and those confidence-building measures, both on the patient and the provider side, are important, as I mentioned earlier, with regard to achieving that balance.", "The federal legislation outlines the eligibility criteria required to obtain MAID, the medical assistance in dying. It requires procedural safeguards to be followed. It requires that a monitoring regime be established and promotes a safe and consistent approach to medical assistance in dying across the country, as I mentioned.", "Now, under the federal legislation, in order to obtain medical assistance in dying, an individual must first be eligible to receive health care services funded by a provincial or territorial government, or federal government, in some instances, in Canada, and must be at least 18 years of age and capable of making important health care decisions, such as this critically important decision, on their own. They must possess a grievous and irremediable medical condition. They must have voluntarily requested medical assistance in dying, and they of course need to give their informed consent to receive medical assistance in dying.", "The federal legislation went further to provide important safeguards which speak to the process which we’ve embraced and adopted here in this province: the requirement that two independent physicians or nurse practitioners determine a patient’s eligibility, that there be a mandatory reflection period for that individual as well, and a requirement that a request for medical assistance in dying be produced in writing in the presence of two independent witnesses.", "So that, in brief, outlines both the Supreme Court decision and the accompanying federal legislation.", "Before I describe the details of the proposed bill before us today and its role in light of these developments, let me provide an overview of the steps that we’ve already taken to support the implementation of medical assistance in dying in Ontario. These steps reflect my commitment and this government’s commitment to providing Ontarians with the best possible information and assistance that they need when making decisions about their own health care. That’s why my ministry implemented a number of initiatives in the months immediately following the passage of that federal piece of legislation, Bill C-14.", "These initiatives that we’ve already implemented include information, tools and training to help patients, to assist health care providers, to assist health care facilities, to enable them all and facilitate their understanding on how to access or offer medical assistance in dying, what the federal legislation speaks to and the process that exists here in this province. We have been working closely with the province’s health regulatory colleges, which regulate our physicians, nurses and pharmacists, to provide guidance on medical assistance in dying to their respective members.", "We’ve moved forward with funding the entire cost of drugs for medical assistance in dying so that they are available to Ontarians at no cost. We have launched a clinician referral service that helps clinicians locate other clinicians willing to provide or assist in the provision of medical assistance in dying. This service is used in those cases where doctors and nurse practitioners may themselves object or not be in a position to provide medical assistance in dying, perhaps on moral or religious grounds, and are looking to refer patients to willing providers. This service is also used for locating a clinician to provide a second assessment—that important second assessment that I referred to as a result of the federal legislation.", "Finally, we have taken steps to ensure that information sharing and monitoring of any implementation issues take place through regular webinars with system leaders and with stakeholders, including health professional associations, sector associations, LHINs and patient groups.", "With these initiatives in place, we are now proposing further steps through this legislation that, if passed, would support the implementation of medical assistance in dying in a manner that aligns with federal legislation. I should add that prior to writing this proposed legislation, we undertook wide consultations in this province, notwithstanding the consultations that I referenced earlier as a result of the national task force that Ontario co-chaired and provided a secretariat for.", "About a year ago, we also had consultations with regard to the issue of medical assistance in dying and what Ontario’s role appropriately might be and the safeguards and access issues that Ontarians were looking for. We had those consultations in many, many jurisdictions, including in Sudbury twice, in both official languages; in Ottawa, again in both languages; separate consultations in Toronto, Sault Ste. Marie, Barrie, Kingston and Thunder Bay. The idea that there wasn’t widespread consultation, which is ongoing until today, highly significant consultations with stakeholders, health care professionals, the associations that represent them, patient groups and advocates—all those parties that necessarily need to play a role as we find our way delicately, but through consensus, to reach that point where, again, we reach that balance of access to patients, to medical assistance in dying, but also understanding that we have an obligation to put safeguards in place for those health care professionals who choose not to participate.", "The proposed legislation, which introduces amendments to a number of provincial acts, remains necessary because we have to and believe that we should provide further support and protection to both providers and patients. Although admittedly the federal legislation is highly comprehensive and contains important safeguards, some of which I referred to earlier, there are some issues that it does not address since they fall under provincial jurisdiction.", "That’s why I am pleased to speak today about Bill 84—not simply to speak, as I will, about the amendments and the changes that are proposed in the proposed legislation, but to provide that background and that context and to give confidence to Ontarians that there is a process that has been undertaken for a number of years now where we have generated so much information and good advice from the entire cross-section of society on this issue, from Ontarians themselves and from those who enjoy that privilege of being front-line workers within our health care sector.", "Speaker, our government introduced this legislation in keeping with the Supreme Court’s decision, and in doing this, it’s important that we provide clarity and direction for clinicians and patients navigating medical assistance in dying and also ensure that there is appropriate oversight for medical-assistance-in-dying deaths in this province. The bill, for this reason, contains a narrow series of amendments to existing legislation, including amendments to the Excellent Care for All Act, which, if passed, would include the following two provisions: First, medical assistance in dying would not affect a right or a benefit that would otherwise exist under a contract or a statute, whether it be life insurance or survivor benefits; and second, physicians, nurse practitioners and persons assisting in the lawful provision of medical assistance in dying would have immunity from civil liability.", "Amendments to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act would ensure that any claims under the act would be determined based on the illness or disease for which the worker was determined to be eligible to receive medical assistance in dying.", "An amendment to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act and the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act would, if passed, protect clinicians and facilities willing to provide medical assistance in dying from being identified under access-to-information laws and requests.", "Further, Mr. Speaker, an amendment to the Coroners Act would, if passed, ensure effective monitoring of medical assistance in dying by requiring the coroner in the first instance to be notified of all medical-assistance-in-dying deaths, clarifying that the existing requirement under the Coroners Act to investigate any death from any cause other than disease does not apply to medical assistance in dying, clarifying when the coroner is required to complete death certificates for medical-assistance-in-dying deaths, and requiring a review of that coroner’s oversight role. The Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services would establish this review process within two years of passage of the bill.", "Finally, there would be an amendment to the Vital Statistics Act. It would clarify requirements respecting the coroner’s documentation of medical-assistance-in-dying deaths and make that consistent with the proposed Coroners Act amendments.", "Mr. Speaker, we realize that end-of-life care is an important and complex issue, and although medical assistance in dying is only one piece of our government’s plan to provide compassionate and effective high-quality care to those requiring end-of-life support, it is an important one. Our government will continue to invest in hospice and palliative care and long-term care to promote greater and full choice for Ontarians who are approaching the end of their life. With any choice an Ontarian makes, whether that be hospice care, palliative care or medical assistance in dying, our government is committed to a respectful, patient-centred approach that truly supports patient choice." ],

It was a great opportunity to get the perspective of a practising physician about the importance of conscience protection and the concerns of medical professionals with this government’s MAID legislation. He spoke to me about how conscience rights are protected in other provinces, including Alberta’s self-refer model.", "One of the things that he said to me was very telling, and I want to repeat the quote that he gave me in my office when we were deliberating on Bill 84: “No one wins when the rights of someone else are trampled on to get my rights.” In other words, we have to find a balance with the legislation. I think other provinces have demonstrated it can be done, that we can respect patients and medical professionals.", "I appreciate the very respectful tone that members have presented in the debate previously when I was in the House last Tuesday and today.

The minister called it “an extremely challenging” bill. It’s a “sensitive and critical” piece of legislation which is needed to bring Ontarian into compliance with the Supreme Court’s decision and the subsequent federal legislation.", "We had a situation in Windsor not long ago—and the minister spoke about the need to recognize those with a religious or moral conviction who are opposed to this legislation on medical assistance in dying—where a patient at a religious hospital wanted to take this step and wanted to be transferred. Because they wouldn’t do it in the religious hospital, he wanted to be transferred to one of the other hospitals in Windsor. Of course, they refused to take him because he wasn’t their patient and they didn’t want to bring him in just for that purpose. So the suggestion was that perhaps he’d have to go to London or some other part of Ontario. So that is something that we have to take into account when we deal with medical assistance in dying.", "In Windsor, the issue goes back to 1996, where we had a 53-year-old tool-and-die maker, Austin Bastable, who went over to Detroit to see Dr. Jack Kevorkian. His life ended in the home of a woman, the local president of the Hemlock Society, where Jack Kevorkian passed him a gas mask and a cylinder of carbon monoxide. His life ended in Detroit because he couldn’t do it in Canada. We’re finally, from 1996 to now, getting to this stage of discussion on this." ],

People would come in—families, distant relatives—and take all the possessions out of people’s homes, leaving the surviving spouse bereft of any memory or money.", "I do remember the first person that I counselled who got a positive test and then went on to get very sick, who wanted to end his life many times.

Earlier today, there were many people here from CORD Canada fighting for rare diseases, but it wasn’t just for rare diseases; it was also for exceptional circumstances in health care.", "One of the big champions of that private member’s motion was a mayor from Trent Hills named Hector Macmillan.

The bill is here to provide clarity and legal protections for health care professionals and organizations that provide access to what’s called MAID services in Ontario, in accordance with federal legislation, Bill C-14.", "I think it’s important for us to note at this particular time that this legislation isn’t about whether you support assisted dying or you don’t. That decision was made by the federal government and, in particular, by the Supreme Court of Canada a few years ago. What we’re actually doing now, in the words of our critic, Jeff Yurek, is just providing clarity. We’re cleaning up some of the loose strings that were left with the federal legislation, as well as the decision by the Supreme Court of Canada.", "In accordance with that ruling, the federal government did pass legislation on June 17 related to medical assistance in dying. As a result, we now have regulatory health professional colleges that will provide guidance and regulations regarding medical assistance in dying. This is a specific issue for a specific problem that was created as a result of legislation. We’re providing clarity. This happens all the time, and it’s why we’re dealing with it.", "One of the things that we hear time and again—and I do have a letter in my desk from one of my constituents—is the concern of those who believe that medically assisted dying should be accessible for those who qualify and want it without forcing institutions and health care practitioners to act against their beliefs. That’s a consistent piece of concern. Whether I agree with it or not is totally irrelevant. I think the reality is that when you look at health care professionals and practitioners, they are actually asking for this, as are many patients.", "Ontario’s regulations, in our opinion, must ensure a balance between individual rights, including recognizing the conscience rights of health care practitioners and facilities, while also protecting vulnerable individuals. We believe there is a path forward, as other provinces have done—notably, I would like to point out, Alberta—to ensure that our health care system respects all perspectives on this issue. It is an issue of personal morality, and that is something that is very difficult to legislate. We respect the conscience rights of professionals.", "Just to point it out, back in February 2015, to give you a sense of the history of this, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the Criminal Code that would prohibit those seeking assisted dying. The court determined a competent adult, like you or myself, who would consent to end their life through what would be apparently a terminal medical condition would be allowable.", "I know this had a robust conversation and debate in the federal House. In fact, I remember at the time, very courageously, the former MP and cabinet minister from Manitoba, who is now a sitting member of the Legislature in Manitoba, Steven Fletcher, talking about his views in a personal way after an accident that he had sustained that made him a quadriplegic. Many of us in this assembly probably do have very personal views. I say this as someone who has lost her father and watched him suffer. I don’t know if this would have been something he would have chosen to do in the ending days of his life, but I do know that we, in our family, really relied on the palliative care system in Nova Scotia.", "If I may say so, as we talk about dying with dignity and dying feeling like you have some control left in your life, the palliative care in that province was quite remarkable. In fact, I would then, after coming back from my father’s funeral, decide that I wanted to get to know a little bit more about Ontario’s palliative care system. This was a decade ago; I was elected 11 years ago. I can say, Speaker, through you, that we do have a remarkable health care system for those in palliative need and hospice care in the dying days. It is in no small part due not to government funding, but due to the people who have the most incredible bedside manner, whether that is a palliative care nurse or palliative care doctor or other people who work in those units.", "I saw it with my own father. Those who choose to spend their career caring for the terminal are indeed angels on earth. So too are the palliative care nurses, doctors, orderlies and those people who are at places like Bruyère or Ruddy-Shenkman or anywhere else in the province. My heart goes out to them because they are very strong and angelic at the same time.", "Not every family, given the new assisted dying legislation, will choose to continue with palliative care if they can choose to terminate their life and die by assisted suicide. That brings a number of different conundrums into play. It’s very important that not only are our patients given the appropriate pain medication, the appropriate relief and the appropriate care, but it’s also important that we consider the needs of our health care professionals in the province of Ontario.", "I know that there are some who do object to providing this type of assistance in order to terminate a life. The Progressive Conservative caucus feels that there needs to be a process in place in order to protect those people. That’s why our critic, Jeff Yurek, will be making an amendment that would protect those rights, but allow those who are seeking to die by assisted suicide to pursue that.", "One of the biggest champions on assisted dying was Dr. Don Low. He died of a brain tumour, and many people may remember Don Low from his advocacy for assisted dying. He made national headlines on this issue as he died. His wife, Maureen Taylor, spoke to our parliamentary committee. She was also the co-chair of the Provincial-Territorial Expert Advisory Group on Physician-Assisted Dying that was set up by our government. He at the time gave an emotional plea on YouTube.", "Sorry. Maureen Taylor was Don’s—okay, I’ve got this a little bit wrong. I’m just actually going to get this right. Maureen Taylor spoke at the committee, and was the co-chair of the provincial-territorial expert committee group. It was her husband, Don, who passed away from a brain tumour. It was he who gave the emotional plea.", "I want to quote what she said at committee, because I think for a woman who has gone through what she’s gone through to appear at committee was quite remarkable, but also to have such a balanced view I think is appropriate for us to discuss in the House. She said, “I want to stress, too, that I totally support the rights of individual health care practitioners not to participate in assisted death if that goes against their conscience.”", "I think it speaks to the balance that we’re looking for on this side of the House that, even though there are strong advocates across the province of Ontario for medical assistance in dying, there are also strong advocates within that area who support the conscience rights of Ontarians who may be involved in health care. That’s why I think it’s important that when we reach out and we speak to organizations like the Canadian Medical Association, who has a policy to support those who provide medical assistance in dying and also those who do not—apparently, from my research, they have advised the College of Physicians and Surgeons to revise their effective-referral approach. The College of Nurses of Ontario also calls for medical assistance in dying to allow nurse practitioners and physicians to administer medications to cause the death of a client.", "There is a great deal of research out there, particularly by many of the big stakeholders. The Canadian Medical Association’s policy is to support those who will choose to participate in MAID, medical assistance in dying, and those who will not. I think that their position articulates a duty that is widely and morally acceptable, and that allows physicians to act as moral agents without in any way impeding or delaying patient access to assisted dying. They support freedom of conscience.", "I think I heard from the minister today that he was pleased not only to receive the support of most members of this assembly, but also that he recognizes that this is a consistent and recurring theme in many of the discussions that we have had. It is always about a fair and balanced approach, particularly as we talk about morality and what people are comfortable with, with their own conscience.", "The Canadian Medical Association further states that the CPSO’s effective-referral approach is encouraged to support the creation of systems and resources that would facilitate access to those seeking MAID services.", "I just mentioned the College of Nurses. They also recognize a nurse’s freedom of conscience. We were fortunate here last week to have the RNAO here talking about some of the challenges in our health care system and what they view in terms of moving forward. I didn’t have the opportunity to speak to them about Bill 84, but we did have a long-ranging, far-reaching discussion on some of the challenges that are faced today in our health care system. It just goes to show you how complex this actually is.", "The College of Nurses of Ontario would probably point out that the legislation doesn’t compel an individual to provide or assist in MAID, but the nurse’s conscience objection must not be directly conveyed to the client, and their personal judgments regarding belief, lifestyle or identity are not to be expressed to the client. I would agree with that. I think that if my personal choice were to be to choose to die by medically assisted suicide, I would want to have people around me who would support that decision, if they were trained professionals. Those who had those strong feelings perhaps shouldn’t convey those to the patient, in which case that would make for, I think, a great deal of trauma for the patient. We all have different views, and we all have different ideas. We all have different expectations of life and death. I, for one, wouldn’t want to tell anybody how to live or to die. That’s obviously a choice that the Supreme Court of Canada allows us.", "The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario effectively talks about this effective referral. I just want to point out—this has come out a number of the times in this assembly over the last 11 years on a variety of different topics within the medical system, but effective referral basically ensures that a patient is connected in a timely manner to another physician who is not objecting. That would provide accessibility to the patient. An effective referral doesn’t guarantee that a patient will receive treatment, but it does ensure access to care and demonstrates respect for patients.", "HealthCARE, which is an organization that agrees with the bill but is seeking an amendment for conscience rights, proposed something at the committee.", "The OMA supports a patient referral option in addition to clinician referral services. The OMA doesn’t support CPSO’s effective-referral policy.", "The Registered Practical Nurses Association of Ontario didn’t propose amendments, but their principal concern remains how MAID will impact the quality and funding of Ontario palliative care services.", "As I just spoke about, I think it’s incredibly important that as we have this debate and we talk about medically assisted dying—I probably have the terminology wrong, Speaker, because I think it probably evolves to be a bit more sensitive than it started out with. I want to say that as much as I respect those choices, I also respect those choices for people who want to die naturally but with the support of a palliative-care hospice unit.", "It’s one of those things. Again, I know for a fact that palliative care, particularly in a terminal patient, won’t save someone’s life. As much as I had hoped when my dad was getting chemotherapy, it was palliative chemo. It wasn’t shrinking his tumour; it was maintaining at least some semblance of life for him, particularly in the last six weeks of his life. He stayed with us until he couldn’t.", "It is an option that we use as family members and as people, after we’ve exhausted all of our options, in order to keep our loved one with us as long as we possibly can. I certainly respect the Registered Practical Nurses Association of Ontario.", "This effectively sums up Bill 84, on medical assistance in dying. It ought not to be controversial, because, again, we are prescribed by the Supreme Court of Canada to accommodate this. Therefore, as we do that and we tie up those loose ends that have been left to us by the federal government and the Supreme Court of Canada, we have to have that discussion about those people who are either comfortable or not in performing this activity.", "I think that there needs to be that sensitivity, and I believe in my heart that when we put forward our amendment, the government will beat us to it and they will respect what so many of their stakeholders are saying, what their expert Dr. Don Low’s wife had said—I want to get her name out there one more time, because I think it’s rather important. Her name is Maureen Taylor.", "I think that when you look at that, we can strike a balance that allows us to meet our statutory obligations, while at the same time understanding that there needs to be a balance for the conscience of the people of this province." ],

It is a personal decision—what you’re going to do, how you’re going to end your life—but I’m going to tell a story, because I think it may be how a lot of people feel, certainly the 20% that aren’t sure whether they agree with assisted dying or not.", "My father-in-law passed away in June. Mr. DeLuca was a wonderful guy. I loved him to death. He passed away over the course of a weekend.

Again, I want to thank all members for their contribution to this debate and, just to reiterate, we are left here with Bill 84 as a result of dealing with federal government legislation due to a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada. Sometimes it is our job not to debate the morality of what the federal Parliament does or what the Supreme Court of Canada does, but we must implement what they expect us to do and that is our role as legislators. That is what we have done here today." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Speaker. I have to tell you, it’s with a bit of frustration that I asked for a late show on this matter. I think most members who are in the House right now have heard me ask the question a number of times. I want to again reiterate that I would like some clarity. It was actually the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change that, on February 1, 2017, at 2 p.m.—it’s very precise in this release—announced changes, or what they called at the time “enhancements,” to the Electric Vehicle Incentive Program.", "I brought this up in the House last week, as well, from a story that Shawn Jeffords from the Sun wrote in the paper which I’m holding. This is the Friday, February 24, 2017, Toronto Sun. It indicates that the minister’s office later, after question period, released a summary of the Integrity Commissioner’s advice to Mr. Myrans, who I understand was the former chief of staff to the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change. It just seems pretty strange. I think I used the phrase that it doesn’t appear to pass the smell test that this ministry issues these changes to the program, which essentially deal with one company, Tesla, and the chief of staff—former chief of staff now—to Minister Murray now works at Tesla.", "I guess the very first thing I would like the parliamentary assistant to acknowledge is that I would like to have the documents that were sent to Mr. Jeffords from the Sun sent to me as well. I think they should make them public. They should allow them to be part of the public record. If it’s good enough to send to Mr. Jeffords, I hope it will be sent to me as well.", "The second thing is that because of the evasive answers that the ministers have given me in this House, both the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change and also the Minister of Transportation, I actually filed an order paper question, which I’ll read into the record—with your indulgence, Speaker. It’s order paper question number 229:", "“Mr. Clark—Inquiry of the Ministry—Would the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change provide all emails sent by his former staff Iain Myrans that contain the word ‘Tesla’ from September 1, 2014 to February 1, 2017.”", "That was filed on February 27. The reason I did that was that this government brags about them being—I think they use sometimes the words, “We’re the most open and transparent government.” I certainly don’t believe that, and I don’t think anybody in Ontario actually believes that. Why should I go through freedom of information? If Kathleen Wynne wants to have an open and transparent government, when a member asks this very specific question which would shed light on this situation, I would ask them to do it. So that’s the second thing that I want the minister’s representative, the member from Beaches–East York, to address.", "Then, the final thing: I received a letter today, which I’ll read into the record, from the Integrity Commissioner, the Honourable J. David Wake. I’ll just paraphrase first. He thanks me for my letter concerning Mr. Myrans regarding the possible breach of part II of Ontario regulation 382/07, “Conflict of Interest Rules for Public Servants (Ministers’ Offices) and Former Public Servants (Ministers’ Offices).”", "I’ll read you this quote: “Pursuant to section 69(4) of the Public Service of Ontario Act, 2007 (PSOA), I can make appropriate inquiries if I have concerns that a conflict-of-interest rule has been contravened by a former public servant that worked in a minister’s office. However, you should be aware that pursuant to section 69(7) of the PSOA, if I elect to make such inquiries regarding Mr. Myrans, I am limited simply to notifying the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change regarding any determinations or directions made with respect to the matter. I have no legal authority to release that information publicly. The decision to do so would be the minister’s.”", "That is the quote from the Integrity Commissioner. So my third question is, will the minister’s office—will you, sir, the parliamentary assistant—guarantee me that the minister will release this information from the Integrity Commissioner and will you make it public?" ],

The Office of the Integrity Commissioner provided written advice to the staff member in question, and the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, as you noted, was copied on that letter. In that written advice, the Integrity Commissioner determined that it was permissible for him to accept the new offer of employment. The Integrity Commissioner has laid out post-service obligations and restrictions to the previous employee that will apply in his new employment, including what’s required under the act: a 12-month restriction on lobbying. The staff member has complied with the advice and the guidance of the Integrity Commissioner.", "Given that he’s followed all of the appropriate rules, it’s really unfortunate that the members opposite, the PCs, are disparaging someone who is now a private citizen in an attempt to try to score cheap political points. They’re asking the Integrity Commissioner, effectively, to look into a matter that he’s already signed off on. We should instead be talking about our plans to fight climate change, to reduce the fossil fuels that are being emitted into the environment. Our action plan will invest in projects that will fight climate change, like transit, electric vehicle incentives and housing retrofits—all great programs fully supported by the people of Ontario.", "There will be absolutely zero funding for green projects and zero funding to manage a transition to a low-carbon economy in the plan that has been half-articulated by the members opposite. According to third-party economic experts, our plan will achieve the highest amount of emissions reductions at the lowest cost. Modelling by economic experts shows that the PC approach will cost families and businesses more, with no guarantees of emissions reductions.", "The Electric and Hydrogen Vehicle Advancement Partnership is the MOECC’s component, which brings together the automotive sector, advocacy organizations, academia and government to increase the number of non-polluting vehicles on Ontario’s roads. We know, as I’ve said earlier, that transportation is contributing about 35% of Ontario’s emissions, so it’s an extremely important sector to get right. Knowing this, our government has rolled out programs to mitigate the amount of emissions that are released by vehicles.", "Our partnership will allow participants to work together on initiatives to help Ontarians save money and lower their carbon footprints. By 2020, we aim to have 5% of cars on Ontario roads to be either electric or hydrogen powered, and this voluntary partnership, coupled with the Electric Vehicle Incentive Program, will help us achieve this goal.", "Speaker, let me just say that our kids are counting on it.

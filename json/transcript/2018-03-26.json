  "text" : [ "I am pleased to rise today, on behalf of the people I represent in London West, to offer some comments on the throne speech that we heard in this place just a week ago today.", "Since that time, over the last week, we have seen a desperate flurry, an outpouring, of announcements that followed that speech, with an endless list of funding commitments. As I watch these announcements, I’m reminded of the infamous comments of John Snobelen. Some of you may remember John Snobelen, the MPP who, back in 1996, shortly after the PC government was elected, talked about creating a “useful crisis.” The reason he talked about creating a crisis was to justify the draconian cuts that were made by the Conservative government to public education in this province. He needed to create a crisis in order to justify the measures that were taken by that government to really gut public education in Ontario. By the time the Conservatives were finished with public education and government in Ontario in 2003, $1.7 billion had been taken out of the education budget for students and schools and communities across this province.", "This time, with this Liberal government and under the leadership of Kathleen Wynne, instead of seeing a crisis at the beginning of this government’s mandate, we have seen a crisis created throughout the government’s mandate. Now, in the final, dying days of that mandate, the Liberals are swooping in, claiming that they have the solution to fix this crisis that they themselves have single-handedly created. Not only are they swooping in to fix this crisis, but they expect to be thanked and congratulated for their commitment to doing something about this crisis that they have brought to our province.", "It is, truly, this kind of manoeuvring, this kind of political game-playing that really makes people cynical about politicians and about politics, because people know—despite what the Liberals are now saying, with their determination and their commitment to make these investments into hospital funding, into home care, into mental health and addictions etc., all the things we heard in the throne speech. People know that the reason we have such problems—intractable, deep, systemic problems—in our systems is because of actions that this government has taken.", "The Financial Accountability Officer certainly knows it when it comes to health care. We heard that in the report that he issued a couple of weeks ago, where he clearly outlined how a deliberate strategy of cutting health care dollars had underfunded hospitals in this province, to the point where we have crises across our province in communities from northern Ontario to eastern Ontario, to the GTA, to southwestern Ontario, where I live, and it is because of those actions that have been taken that we find ourselves in the mess that we are in today.", "Speaker, the throne speech focused on hospital funding as one of the commitments that the Liberals were going to be delivering following that speech in this new session of the Legislature. Where I come from, in London West, we know something about hospital funding. We know that just since Premier Wynne took office, $142 million has been removed from the budget of London Health Sciences Centre. London Health Sciences Centre has been forced to try to figure out how to absorb the significant loss of those dollars while still trying to serve the people in the community that I represent.", "We have had some recent, very troubling cases that have resulted from this underfunding of hospital services in my community. I want to speak for a moment about a London West constituent whom we have talked about in this House on several occasions, Stuart Cline.", "Stuart Cline was a constituent of mine who had gone on vacation with his family to Mexico. While he was in Mexico, he suffered a serious fall and experienced bleeding in the brain. The fall happened on a Wednesday. Several days later, by the Saturday, the doctors in the hospital in Mexico had stabilized Stuart Cline and had cleared him to travel. He had purchased travel insurance prior to his vacation, and his insurer was doing everything possible to try to get Mr. Cline back to a hospital in the community, in southwestern Ontario—in fact, anywhere in Ontario. The family just wanted Stuart Cline to come home.", "The insurer was unable to locate a bed. The insurer had been working with the health ministry. They had contacted my office to try to get my help to get Stuart Cline home. But Saturday, the day he was stabilized, there were no beds. Saturday became Sunday, Sunday became Monday, Monday became Tuesday, which is when my office was notified, and it was only on the Thursday that Mr. Cline was finally relocated to St. Catharines, and that was no thanks to this Ministry of Health. That was because of the efforts of his family members.", "Now, the Minister of Health would like to say that there were beds available, that there was just a glitch in terms of communication between the insurance company and the hospital in order to find that capacity to allow Stuart Cline to come back to Ontario. But, Speaker, this was not an isolated incident. Stuart Cline is one of many Ontarians whose stories have been shared in this Legislature. I’m just going to talk about a couple more of them.", "Joe Glowacki: another constituent of mine from London West. He had a heart attack in Arizona in December 2017. He was stabilized and cleared for travel the very next day, but there was no hospital available for him to relocate to Ontario. Speaker, I can tell you, his insurer was highly motivated to get Mr. Glowacki back to Ontario. His insurer was paying $20,000 a day in a US hospital and wanted nothing more than to get Mr. Glowacki back to this province, but there were simply no beds available. There was no capacity in the system to enable Mr. Glowacki to travel back to this province.", "Bryan Sockett was a Toronto-area man who experienced pneumonia while travelling in the Dominican Republic. That was back in January. He also was cleared for travel. He had an insurance company that was working diligently to get him back to Ontario. But once again, the insurer was unable to find an available bed in this province, and Bryan Sockett tragically died in hospital in Florida. They were able to transfer him from the Dominican to Florida, but were unable to get him back to Ontario.", "David Ronald from Hamilton had fallen while travelling in Costa Rica back in February. Same story: His insurer was trying very hard to locate a bed for him in his home community, or basically anywhere in the general vicinity, and was unable to get a bed for him to return to.", "Larry Dann: another London man who waited eight days in a US hospital. This, again, happened in February. He was cleared for travel home, but was unable to return to Ontario because there was no capacity in any area hospital for him to return to.", "Todd Hrabchak, an 83-year-old Toronto man: again, trapped in a hospital in Florida, unable to get back to Toronto to a hospital bed where he could be cared for.", "This is a systemic issue. This is not just a miscommunication between the insurance company and the receiving hospital. There is no capacity in hospitals in this province, and this has been going on for a long time. This is not a new problem that has suddenly arisen in this province.", "Another one of the implications of the lack of access to beds is that people are getting their so-called elective surgeries cancelled or postponed. These are surgeries that can be scheduled, but are often dealing with very, very serious medical conditions.", "Chris Punter is a Londoner who was in need of cardiac bypass surgery. His surgery was cancelled four times because London Health Sciences Centre could not provide him with a bed to recover in after his surgery would be complete. The fourth time his surgery was cancelled he was actually in a hospital gown with the wires already on his body when he was told, “Sorry, we can’t accommodate you. There are no recovery beds, so we’ll have to reschedule.”", "Another equally concerning consequence of this chronic underfunding of our hospital system is the paramedics—the ambulances—who are lined up in hospital bays waiting to off-load their patients. In London, we saw some statistics reported in January that said that off-load delays for paramedics have more than doubled from 2015 to 2017. There were just over 5,000 off-load delays in 2015 and more than 10,000 off-load delays in 2017. There was a 45% jump in off-load delays in just one year, from 2016 to 2017. The deputy chief of Middlesex-London EMS says that that it’s not unusual to find seven or eight ambulance crews stuck at each of our city’s two emergency rooms. These are ambulances that are taken off the road, that are unavailable to respond to health care emergencies when they arise.", "We know that incidents of code critical coverage, when there are only three available ambulances, and code zero coverage, when there are no ambulances, are becoming much more frequent in my community and, actually, in communities across the province. This, obviously, has a direct impact on patient care.", "Last week, we saw the government have a big announcement about funding that was provided to SickKids, but we know that SickKids, every day for the last year, has had occupancy rates of over 100%. The hospital’s average occupancy rate was 108%. What this means is that families in critical care are forced to share a room with as many as five other patients and their families. Children who are undergoing bone marrow transplants don’t have access to washrooms in their rooms because of the overcrowding that’s happening in these facilities.", "We heard in March, earlier this month, from CHEO, the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Hospital. CHEO said they had to send away a dozen children so far—that’s in the first two months of 2018—including four babies, critically ill infants and toddlers. These children are being sent far away from home, far away from their families, to access the care they need, in Montreal, in Toronto, in Kingston.", "Speaker, this is absolutely unacceptable. This is an issue that has been highlighted over and over and over again by MPPs in this Legislature from across this province. Now, all of a sudden, the government has said, “This is a problem and we’re going to fix it.” They haven’t said that this is a problem that they deliberately created through six years of continuous cuts to funding to hospital services.", "Another issue that was highlighted in the throne speech was around mental health. Again, we saw a big announcement last week about what the Liberals are going to do to fix this crisis in mental health that they have created.", "A crisis in mental health is something that my community is very familiar with. It is not a new issue. I will remind members that four years ago I shared the story of 18-year-old Jenepher Watt, a young woman in my community who went to access emergency mental health services at London Health Sciences Centre and was forced to sleep on the floor of the emergency room while waiting for psychiatric care. Just last year, I shared the story of Angela Jolly, a constituent in my riding who laid for a week on a stretcher in the hallway at London Health Sciences Centre waiting to access a psychiatric bed.", "One of the other issues that we have been raising consistently over the last number of years is around wait times for hip and knee replacements. I’ll call the government’s attention to a story from December 2015, so two and a half years ago, when surgeons in my community took to the barricades to put the blame squarely on the health minister, saying that long wait times in London—actually, London has longer wait times for hip and knee replacements than any other area of the province. But they directly attributed this to shortfalls in funding from the Ministry of Health.", "What was happening in my community—I was hearing from numerous constituents who were waiting two years or more to have their hip or knee replaced. As a result, people were falling, and they were at much higher risks of falls. They were experiencing terrible pain and suffering, having to rely more and more on painkillers to manage the pain. They were feeling increasingly isolated, as they were no longer able to participate in their regular community activities. Their mental health was suffering.", "The consequences of this chronic underfunding of our health care system multiply in many different ways. It’s not as if this government did not know about these problems until the throne speech was announced last week.", "We just heard about the government’s increase in funding to hospitals, with the addition of new mental health beds in my community. But Speaker, we had heard back in October that 24 beds were going to be added to London Health Sciences Centre—no information, since then, as to when those beds will be open. There was a Post-it Note that was delivered to the Minister of Health, which she shared with me, about some new staffing that was going to be added to the London Health Sciences Centre, but no real communication from this government about what was happening to address our very serious mental health issues.", "I have to say, while the Liberals can try as they like to dress up what was in the throne speech and this flurry of announcements that followed, people aren’t being taken in. People understand that the problems that the Liberals are now claiming to be so committed to addressing are problems that they themselves created; they are problems that they themselves could have taken action on many years before we got to this throne speech and this budget that we’re expecting on Wednesday. They could have done that, but they chose not to. They chose to wait until the eleventh hour. We’re 72 days before an election, and now this is when they say they’re finally taking notice." ],

Last spring I was at my local hospital, Southlake Regional Health Centre, a centre that I’m exceptionally proud of. It’s a regional cancer care centre. It’s a regional cardiac care centre. In fact, our cardiac care centre has doctors from the United States coming to Canada, coming to Ontario, coming to Newmarket, to learn new techniques to repair hearts in a very non-invasive way so that folks don’t have to spend too much time in the hospital and can get back to their lives. I’m very proud of this hospital. Southlake couldn’t do it without a real commitment from this government in health care.", "What I’ve seen, year over year, month over month, is more and more investment in health care across the province. I could speak about the 40 new hospitals that have been built in this province. I could talk about increasing health care spending with every single budget this government has put in play. But I only need go to my local hospital and look at the $5 million we committed last year, the $8.3 million I was there this week to talk about, or, more importantly for my riding, the 12 adult mental health beds that we’re going to be building at our hospital—and that’s about renovating an about 8,000-square-foot centre to put these 12 beds into. These are the types of commitments that this province has been making year after year after year.", "I look at organizations like the Fraser Institute, the Wait Time Alliance—I look to these third-party organizations to tell me how well we’re doing in Ontario, and they tell us that Ontario has consistently ranked as having some of the shortest wait times for major surgeries in all of Canada." ],

Those are things that all could have been added to any of these debates on the throne speech.", "This Premier and her government, who have doubled our debt on their pet projects and self-interest, would now like the public to believe a throne speech that promises long-needed investment in long-ignored needs for the people of Ontario. After 15 years of waste and neglect, I suggest this Premier should think of investing in something else—investing in a good clock, because their time is running out over there very quickly.", "Speaker, that throne speech also reminded me of the comments from the Auditor General. I think they’re very similar in public accounts. The Auditor General alleged that the fair hydro scheme’s financial and accounting structure was designed to avoid reporting the cost of rate reductions on Ontario’s public accounts, thus allowing the government to falsely claim it had a balanced budget at the end of last year. She estimated that Ontario’s deficit would be understated by more than $1.3 billion.", "I think there are some very significant similarities between the throne speech and the public accounts comments from the Auditor General.

When they’ve got 15 years of answering the phones from constituents and, hopefully, doing some work in the communities, they know what the issues are; they know where the challenges are. They know about our partner organizations that are doing the heavy lifting and don’t have the government’s support. They’ve just chosen to ignore it. Now, as the member from London West pointed out, 72 days out from an election, the government is suddenly saying, “Here, we’ve got an idea: You get a car, and you get a car, and you get a car”—and I should check under my seat to see if there’s anything under there for me. No, there’s not. There’s just disappointment from the past 15 years.

I could also tell stories about folks in my riding; we all could. This is why this is so personal. And this is why it’s not just about “too little, too late.” It’s that nobody believes them any more.

For example, I think in the last throne speech we said, “We’re going to introduce what we call OHIP+. It will be free pharmacare for everybody under 24.” And then when we came around to the following budget, we put that money in the budget.", "In fact, effective January 1 of this year, 2018, that program that we said we were going to deliver, we delivered, and what I heard from people in Guelph was how much they appreciated that. It might be students—because it’s Guelph; there are lots of students. They appreciated it. They’re under 24. But it was often homeowners who have grandchildren and who recognized that either their little grandchildren or their 18-, 19-, 20-year-old grandchildren were getting their drug needs totally covered by the Ontario government.

I’ll take this opportunity to give a shout-out to my cousin’s daughter Christina, who is a nurse and is enjoying being part of that front line providing services to the children that she sees.", "We have built a system that is doing an incredible job of taking care of the people we love. About six weeks ago, a close friend of the family, my parents’ friend, who is about 76, had to undergo heart surgery. This was not his first heart surgery. He actually had three major surgeries that same week. Fortunately, he is recovering well and is now at home after being at St. John’s Rehab. Neither he nor his wife has enough words to say about the thankfulness and the gratitude they have for our health care system and the wonderful system we have in place today, and could not understand why they would read in the paper, see on the news or hear from the parties opposite about our health care system being in a shambles, because that is not at all what they have experienced.", "We’ve increased our investments in the system, and we are making significant progress. We continue to reduce wait times for surgery, increase access to primary health care providers, and expand services for Ontarians at home and in their communities. We have a system that has the best survival rates for prostate, breast, colorectal and lung cancer in Canada. That is why we continue to make health care a priority, including taking the first step towards universal pharmacare through OHIP+.", "We are continuing to take action to help thousands of families with health care costs through OHIP+. Since January, when we introduced this program, over one million free prescriptions have been filled through OHIP+.", "We made the biggest expansion to medicare in Ontario in a generation by providing drug coverage for over four million children and youth across this province, who now have access for free—no copayment, no deductible—to over 4,400 drugs.

I’ve said here before in this House already when I introduced and made the announcement in my riding of Davenport on our plan to provide free medication to our children and youth through the OHIP+ program—I did that at one of the local elementary schools.", "When I was making that announcement, after the announcement, the principal approached me and said, “Cristina, this is huge—huge.” She had a wall full of EpiPens in her office, and she said that when those pens expire, she has to call the parents to say, “Mrs. Smith, Mr. Smith, your child’s EpiPen has expired. We now need to have a new pen.” Oftentimes she would hear from the other side, saying, “Miss, is it okay if we just hold off another month? I don’t know that I can afford to have that EpiPen replaced right now.”", "Just imagine what this OHIP+ is doing for families now in my riding of Davenport and across Ontario. We want everyone in Ontario to feel this kind of freedom, to be able to not have to choose whether or not they were going to refill their child’s prescription for an EpiPen because everybody in this province, no matter their age, deserves the chance to lead healthy and happy lives.", "After announcing OHIP+ for our children and youth, my riding of Davenport, which is home to a large number of seniors—I had my seniors calling me up. “Cristina, we came to this country. We built this city, and we built this province. We’ve been here for so long, and we have so many medications we have to take. What about the seniors?” We know that the cost of health care can cause anxiety and stress, especially for people 65 and over who are living on fixed incomes and are often required to take multiple medications. We want the best care for our parents and our grandparents, which is why we’ve announced that we are expanding OHIP+ to make prescription drugs free for people 65 and over.", "Beginning August 1, 2019, more than 4,400 prescription drugs will be available free of charge to everyone 65 and over—again, no deductible, no copayment, and this expansion will make life more affordable for 2.6 million seniors and their families and will result in prescription drugs being free for nearly one in two Ontarians. This makes us much closer to the goal of pharmacare for everyone in the province of Ontario." ],

It’s a pleasure to follow my colleague from Davenport, a new member who has brought some real passion and fire and has done a wonderful job representing her constituents.", "In discussing health care, I think there was one point that’s worth both underlining and emphasizing, and that is that 15 years ago, in 2003, Ontario had Canada’s longest wait times. Today, we have Canada’s shortest wait times. However imperfect the system may be, there is no doubt that what we’ve seen in the last 15 years in health care has been progress.", "I also want to talk about a couple of other things. I was out chatting with some of the neighbours in Lisgar, Meadowvale and Streetsville over the last several days. A few of them have said, “Talk to us a little bit about the amount of money that Ontario borrowed.” I said, “Okay, that’s actually a fair question.” I said, “Well, let’s, first of all start, with an important metric.”", "During the last PC government, between 1995 and 2003, what was the effective rate of interest on debt as a ratio of Ontario’s revenue? The answer is that it was between 14% and 15%. What is it today? It’s 8.5%. What is Ontario’s effective interest rate on its debt: 3.5%. So with that as a prelude, let’s go into some of the trade-offs that Ontario faced.", "In this fiscal year of 2017-18, the province of Ontario will, for the fourth time in the last 15 years, run a budget surplus. I live in Mississauga, which is part of Peel region. Every so often I see one of my political idols and mentors, former Ontario Premier Bill Davis, who takes a lot of interest in my career. Perhaps he’s watching, and if so, hello, Premier Davis.", "Do you know how many budget surpluses Brampton Bill ran between 1971 and 1985? None. Zero. Let’s just put that into perspective: In the golden years of the red Tories all of the budgets were in deficit; in the 15 years of Liberal government—four budget surpluses.", "It would have been more had we not had a global recession that didn’t start here but nonetheless left the province of Ontario having to stare into the abyss and say, “The society in which we are functioning has fundamentally changed. What are we going to do to cope with it?”", "In so doing, Ontario set a nine-year path back to a balanced budget. Here’s the important part: Ontario never once missed a deficit reduction target, not a single time. In fact, in one year, I think it was around 2013 or 2012, we actually in absolute terms spent less than the province had spent the year before. In part, that was because of economic recovery and more people coming off social assistance. But it was also the discipline that the province showed in managing public expenses. We got back exactly on schedule precisely as planned, after nine years, to a balanced budget.", "Now it’s time to move forward in the act of closing the books on a period that involved a recovery from a recession and opening up a new era. That’s a good time to say, in closing the books and starting a new chapter, let’s have a prorogation of the House. That’s why there was a speech from the throne. From the speech from the throne, we’re going to see a lot of those details fleshed out in Ontario’s budget.", "Despite coping with the recession—something that I do want to mention to our folks in Mississauga—support for municipalities since 2003 has nearly quadrupled and now stands at about $4.2 billion a year—quadrupled. So Ontario actually did get something for its money.", "In doing a lot of borrowing during the recession—because the only worse alternative would have been not to borrow the money—Ontario got a rebuilt electricity sector; it got a rebuilt road network; it got a rebuilt post-secondary system. It got a rebuilt elementary and secondary system, where a lot of our buildings in Mississauga and Brampton received money for capital repairs that had gone undone in the 15 years prior to that. People were saying, “Oh, my God, our school is falling apart.” A lot of the principals would say, “The thing that worries me is two heavy snowstorms because I don’t think my roof will take it.” A lot of those schools were upgraded, and new schools were built.", "Where we used to, in Mississauga, be subject to brownouts, and during the big blackout of 2003, which I will have to say for clarity was not the fault of the previous government—nonetheless, it showed the weaknesses in the system that they had inherited but not improved. Now those same set of circumstances would not cause a blackout.", "A lot of that came with investing about $150 billion into Ontario’s infrastructure—a continuing investment, which, looking forward, is going to continue to see transit evolve, it will continue to see our roads get better and it will continue to see our investment in education, both primary and secondary.", "Here are a couple of examples. Last week, recognizing now that we have a budget surplus, our local MPPs gathered at Trillium Health Partners at the Sherway Gardens site, to announce that as part of Ontario’s plan this fiscal year to invest an additional $822 million Ontario-wide, our hospitals—our Credit Valley hospital, our hospital on Queensway and our clinic at Sherway Gardens—would receive $12.8 million in non-targeted funds. These are funds to use to meet rising day-to-day costs, growth funding, and also to fund additional procedures. They would receive an additional $9.9 million in targeted funds, which includes wait time funding, priority programs and services, and post-construction operating plans. All of this means a better ability to increase emergency department volume, hire more nurses, support more physiotherapy procedures, fund longer clinic times, and more MRI hours. It means more ability to meet next year’s salaries; to buy the supplies that are used in our hospitals; to pay utility bills; and to ensure that our hospital staff have all the tools, the instruments and the supplies they need when they treat us when we go to Credit Valley or the Queensway site or to Sherway Gardens. Now, that’s important.", "Another thing that the province has invested money in during the recovery—and when interest rates are almost zero, and when labour is available, and when you’ve got an infrastructure deficit during a recession, why would you not spend the money? In larger economic terms, during a recession, when big business isn’t spending money, and if government is not spending money, then what is there for individuals to earn or save, and who is there for small businesses to sell to? Particularly in a world where you’ve got cross-linked economies, you’ve got to have somebody who is spending, in order that somebody else can either earn or save. That’s part of the reason that Ontario invested the money that it did when it did.", "So what did it get us? It bought us the infrastructure and the resources that we are going to need tomorrow, but we paid yesterday’s prices for them and financed them over their entire lifetime at interest rates of very close to zero. That’s intelligent use of money. That’s the way to do things during an economic recovery.", "What was the upshot of that? Judging by metrics such as, “Has the number of people working come back to what it was before the recession?” and “Is your GDP back to what it was before the recession?” and so on, Ontario had completely recovered from the recession by the spring of 2011. It took the austerity-bound United States of America an extra three and a half years to recover from the recession.", "Austerity is a policy that has never worked anywhere it has been tried, any time it has been tried. Over in Europe, where they kept pushing austerity on their nations, it took them even longer. The UK was in danger of being the first triple-dip recession in world economic history.", "But in Ontario, we’ve now recovered. We’ve added a net 800,000 new jobs, most of those full-time jobs, most of those high-paying, high-skill, high-tech jobs. What it has meant is that from nothing in the mid-2000s, we now have a renewable and green energy industry here in the province of Ontario that is export-oriented, that hires our graduates and employs some 50,000 people. We didn’t have that, going into the recession.", "Ontario now rivals London as a financial centre. We didn’t have that to the same degree, going into the recession. Ontario is now a financial services powerhouse. Ontario is a life sciences powerhouse. We were working on that prior to the recession, and that, too, took targeted investments, but now, when you talk about the life sciences—which employ some of the best of our university grads—you’re talking about the area around MIT, Harvard and Cambridge on the east coast of the United States; the area around Silicon Valley on the west coast of the United States; and Ontario.", "Ontario is one of those big three. That’s what you get for investing during a recession. You get something that not only pulls you out of the recession but it employs your best, it keeps your good ideas at home, and it means that people are going to find good, challenging careers—not just jobs; careers—right here at home. That was one of the differences that it made for Ontario during the recession.", "It also meant that in our electricity sector—this isn’t just something that powers the province. This is something that drives Ontario too, because it is not merely the thing that we use to power our machinery; it’s an economic engine that produces benefits right here at home. When we spend money on our electricity sector, between 80 and 90 cents on the dollar stays in Ontario. It’s good jobs; it’s solid careers. They are high-paying jobs, and they’re jobs with a future, and we have those here. We did renew our electricity sector. We did spend $35 billion, mostly here in Ontario, renewing our power generation, and $15 billion renewing our power transmission.", "Let’s talk a little bit about getting people around, in my last couple of minutes. Speaking about my home area, Lisgar, Meadowvale and Streetsville in the city of Mississauga, when I was elected there were five GO trains, each of which pulled eight cars. Today there are 10 trains in each direction, each of which pulls 12 cars. That’s well more than double the GO train service in the last 15 years.", "There is a new bus repair depot in Streetsville where GO buses can start and finish their Mississauga run. It is located in Streetsville and it drives the employment of nearly 200 people. GO buses connect frequently to Toronto and other points during the day, with ample capacity for passenger demand. More importantly, you can use your Presto card on the bus, just like you do on the train, and it gets you home as fast as or faster than the train during off hours.", "There was a new GO train station in Lisgar, the first new GO train station opened in 25 years. It was completed in 2007. It was completed seven weeks ahead of schedule and it was completed under budget. By the way, the same thing happened with phase 2 at Credit Valley: It was completed ahead of schedule and it was completed under budget.", "All of our western Mississauga GO train stations have been upgraded. All of their platforms have been lengthened and there is now free WiFi in the stations.", "The Presto card has replaced the cash fare. It used to be that you needed exact cash fare to get on the MiWay bus to connect with the GO train, where you needed to buy a two- or 10-ride pass or have a monthly pass. Then, if you were taking the TTC, you had to either use tokens or have exact cash fare for the TTC. Now you just need one card, one Presto card, and it works for everything.", "That’s part of the evolution of public transit. That’s part of the modern system that Ontario is headed to in the future. That’s part of the reason that this is the throne speech for the 2020s and beyond and why I support it." ],

You have to remember they inherited those surpluses from the previous government. I know they did the best they could to make sure that first year appeared as a deficit because they spent billions of dollars—$3 billion, actually, in the last week of March—just to make sure that that last PC government appeared as a deficit. But of course we know that year the auditor reported that it actually was a surplus.", "We agree that when times are bad, like when the economy fell apart in 2008, there is a need to run deficits. But I don’t see that happening today. On the one hand, they brag about how the economy is racing ahead, and on the other hand they talk about how all of a sudden $8 billion in debt is required. I mean, you can’t have it both ways. The finance minister said last year, “We’ve got a balanced budget,” which of course the Auditor General is disputing, and they are trying to discredit her ability. But this is a false surplus. Everybody knows that. They sold off a number of assets to try to make it that way and it’s still not going to make it. I guess we won’t find that out until about September, when the books are finally closed and audited.", "But this is not a government that shows any ability to manage funds. Highest subnational debt in the world: That’s nothing to brag about, but that is something completely on these shoulders. Maybe Premier Davis ran some deficits, but you guys have more than doubled it in the last—and the NDP doubled it before that. So minor deficits were not a problem." ],

There isn’t even the number of existing beds in our system to cover off the number on the wait-list.", "I’d love to have a conversation about alternate level of care, or ALC, which is taking up our hospital space for folks in transition, in limbo. Are they even on waiting lists? They’re just in limbo, so do they count? Are they on the waiting list? I’d love to put them somewhere.

Could they ever?", "I’m really looking forward to standing on that side of the House as government when we provide the Ontario benefits plan that we have talked about, because that is actually going to make a real difference to folks—not just for the pharmacare, which is a massive deal, but also dental. When it comes to cost savings, what does it cost to go to a hospital time after time with dental pain, never getting the problem solved? What would it cost to actually solve it? Let’s look at that.

What they didn’t rebuild was a $1.2-billion gas plant that we got nothing for. They promised to sell Hydro One to balance the budget, and yet they’re coming with an $8-billion deficit again this year, after the finance minister was standing and saying, “The year after and the year after that, we will balance the budget.” Mr. Speaker, I’m a little concerned at times when he talks about that.", "He talked about rebuilding roads, bridges and infrastructure. I can tell you that certainly in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, my municipalities are very concerned about where the structures are, what the life and longevity of those structures are, and the lack of funding to ensure that they can be replaced. In fact, in Chesley right now, I’m hopeful that the government is going to come up and help them, because one was wiped out by some flooding, and we need that to be fixed as quickly as possible.", "He didn’t mention a whole lot about long-term care.

In my time this afternoon, I want to discuss a few of those reasons.", "First, the government tries desperately to take credit for Ontario’s economic growth. The speech went on about the recent growth rate, unemployment numbers and job creation, but their words were misleading, to say the least, because let me assure you that any positive trends we see in the economy today are in spite of, not because of, this government’s disastrous policies.", "I’m not alone in this assessment, Speaker. The Fraser Institute recently came out with an analysis titled Debt and Decline—Ontario’s Challenges in Three Snapshots. Let me read a few quotes that might cause my colleagues on the other side to reconsider their optimism.", "“Economic weakness has characterized Ontario’s economy for much of the last decade, and the recent upturn in economic activity in 2017 should have helped Ontario climb out of its long string of operating deficits—nine since 2008-09.” That’s nine deficits since 2008, Speaker.", "The report goes on: “Another large deficit will simply add to the chronic long-term economic and fiscal problems facing the province; problems which can be described simply as rising debt and economic decline.”", "Now, that’s quite a contrast with the bubbly, optimistic language of the throne speech. Just going by the throne speech, we could be forgiven for thinking that the Liberals had never promised to keep the budget balanced; that would be wrong, however.", "There’s a great line in the throne speech that says, “Our economy remains in transition.” I would say this government appears to have transitioned away from this province to balance the books, to the tune of about $8 billion, according to our finance minister.", "Such a broken promise will have real and lasting consequences. As the Fraser Institute warns, “Ontario’s debt will rise independently of any operating deficits given the planned increases in capital spending. Add to this mix the potential for a recession, uncertain export markets due to the NAFTA renegotiation, and the upward movement of interest rates, and you have a set of forces poised to harm the Ontarians across the province.”", "Another thing that struck me as odd about the throne speech was the timing. Normally, a government will prorogue Parliament to do a throne speech to set out new priorities for the upcoming session. The only problem is, there’s not much of a session or of Parliament left to go; we’re just over 10 weeks away from election day, in fact.", "So why the disruption?

The throne speech was “nothing more than a Liberal campaign commercial.” Don’t take it from me, Speaker; these words came from one of our most experienced and fair-minded colleagues, the member for Wellington–Halton Hills. The member went on to say, “It’s disgraceful that the Liberals have chosen to politicize the parliamentary tradition of the throne speech in this way.” And I agree.", "It’s obvious the government is counting on people to have very short memories, but they don’t forget.

Let’s not forget the almost-$54,000 spent on Canada Goose jackets.", "That’s their legacy: entitlements for their special friends and blatant disrespect for Ontario taxpayers.", "And it gets worse, I’m sorry to say. Not only is this government desperately rushing billions in new spending out the door; their claim of a balanced budget also doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. In order to achieve this phony balance, the Liberals have pulled every shady accounting trick in the book.

In essence, the government is making up its own accounting rules.”", "Just last week, the auditor appeared before the public accounts committee. She estimates that at the end of the year Ontario’s deficit would be understated by more than $1.3 billion, an amount that will continue growing.", "She said, “We think this accounting is bogus.” From such a well-qualified, non-partisan official, that’s quite a devastating indictment. “We think this accounting is bogus,” is what she said.", "We also found out, according to a leaked Liberal cabinet document, that the government’s plan isn’t actually going to lower hydro rates in the long run. By their own projections, hydro rates are set to skyrocket in the years following the June election. So there we have it: a phony hydro plan used to justify a phony balanced budget. Only the Ontario Liberals could come up with such a shameless ploy.", "I would also like to discuss the cynical nature of this government’s new spending promises. Speaker, the government has had 15 years to fix the pressing issues facing the people of Ontario: issues like unacceptably long wait times for basic medical procedures; the rise of so-called hallway medicine; ballooning wait-lists for long-term-care beds and the lack of a plan to meet future demand; the youth mental health crisis and the desperate need for investments in mental health services.", "Families are being crushed under the weight of taxes and regulations, and small businesses are being forced to lay off workers and shutter their operations.

Too bad the Liberals didn’t seem interested in addressing it until now.", "Those are just a few examples of people struggling under this government’s terrible mismanagement. There are literally thousands of families who, each day, have to choose between heating their homes or eating a meal. Where is the relief for these families? When is help going to arrive for them?", "Meanwhile, the Liberals and their insider friends are cashing in at taxpayers’ expense. It’s good timing—bad timing for the government, I guess—that we saw the release of the 2017 sunshine list last week. In there, we find that the CEO of Ontario Power Generation enjoyed a $400,000 raise this year. That brings his salary to $1.5 million a year.", "Then we have the secret members of the Hydro One millionaires’ club—whose salaries have conveniently been yanked from the list—stuffing their pockets with taxpayers’ dollars while real families struggle to pay their bills. It’s shameful.", "I also want to mention the countless hours of debate and behind-the-scenes work that this government’s prorogation and the throne speech negated. People watching at home may not be aware that when the government prorogues Parliament, all private members’ business is wiped off the agenda. That includes order paper questions, motions and other important items to hold the government accountable.", "More importantly, the government effectively killed all private members’ bills that were introduced in the last session. In my case, that meant the demise of my firefighter safety bill, the Rea and Walter Act. That bill was named in honour of two North Perth fire service members, Ken Rea and Ray Walter, who died battling a fire in March 2011. That tragedy happened when the roof of the Listowel dollar store collapsed. The legislation would require that buildings with truss and lightweight construction display a decal that alerts firefighters ahead of time. It’s a simple idea that could save lives.", "Last spring, my bill was supported unanimously at second reading. That day, the galleries above you were filled with the Rea and Walter families, along with dozens of firefighters from Perth–Wellington.", "Unfortunately, the Liberals let the bill languish in committee for months, and then with prorogation they killed it entirely. That’s disappointing, Speaker. It’s yet more evidence that the Liberals’ decision to prorogue wasn’t about the public interest; it was about their own political self-interest. I will be reintroducing the Rea and Walter Act later this week. I urge the government to fast-track it through the committee and to a final vote in this place.", "To conclude, Speaker, the people of this province deserve far better than the misleading campaign commercial that was the throne speech.

That was going to close down a long-term-care facility that had over 90 beds and that has been in our community for quite a long time. Besides getting rid of the beds, it would have hurt the people working there, where we would have people not being able to find the jobs that they love.

Their voices were heard and, fortunately, the then-minister made the decision that those long-term-care beds would stay in Perth county.", "That’s what we asked for. We had members of all of the councils there. They had one goal that they were after, and that’s that the beds would stay in Perth county.

We have the interest to work in the long-term-care business in the riding, and yet they face more paperwork than what they need to get it done. They have the land, everything is ready to go, and yet they run into roadblocks when they try to get the project by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.", "I would ask the government to really take a look at what was in this throne speech and call it for what it is. It was just a document, because there is an election that’s coming up in June.

In Thunder Bay, we did not historically have very much, if any, of what you could refer to as “supportive housing.” We created, as part of a $100-million long-term-care investment in the city of Thunder Bay, in my riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan, a project called the CEISS project, the Centre of Excellence for Integrated Seniors’ Services, a $100-million investment. It’s been up and running now, I would guess, for about five or six years.", "Part of that is the Sister Leila Greco Centre. It has 132 supportive housing units in it. Before that investment, that level of supportive housing, if any, did not exist in the city of Thunder Bay. The 132 units—I think most of them are two-bedroom—accommodate probably 170 to 180 people.

Our government has made very important strides in trying to support women and others who have experienced disadvantages traditionally in the workplace. What we have seen, in order to assist in that regard, is increases to the minimum wage. We have seen enhanced employment protections. We have seen investments in child care and education. That’s just a few among the many initiatives that the government has taken very decisive action on.", "What we’re proposing today is some further measures, and I really hope the Pay Transparency Act that I’m speaking to today is going to be adopted unanimously by this House. Women’s economic equality, I think most people in the province of Ontario would agree, should be a non-partisan issue. I’m confident and I’m really hopeful that both opposition parties will support the measures that we’re going to put forward today.", "The Women’s Economic Empowerment Strategy was announced on March 6 of this year by the Premier; we were at a woman’s empowerment summit that was held in the city of Toronto. There is a strategy behind this, Speaker. The strategy is a key part of the government’s approach to building a strong and very inclusive economy.", "What we are going to do is remove systemic barriers that to date have prevented women’s full economic participation by promoting fairer workplaces, by changing perspectives about gender, promoting women’s leadership, promoting access to jobs and promoting career advancement.", "In the province of Ontario, as I speak today, women represent about 48% of the labour force and they represent more than half of our university and college graduates. Yet the reality we find in the province of Ontario today is that women continue to experience marked economic disadvantages in our province in business, in our workplaces and our society. For example, a lot of young women and young men are very, very surprised when I tell them that the gender wage gap in Ontario is still about, on average, 30%, and over the past 10 years has remained largely unchanged. What that means, very simply, and this surprises and alarms a lot of people, is that women earn 70 cents for every dollar that’s earned by men in this province.", "A lot of people would have thought those days were behind us. The sad reality is, they are not. Women who are working are more likely to reduce their hours of work or to take part-time jobs to balance paid employment with unpaid caregiving responsibility, which still in our society today falls primarily on women.", "When you add in other intersections, when you talk about racialized women, immigrant women, indigenous women and women with disabilities, they experience even greater disadvantages and larger wage gaps than the 30% I’m talking about. Our government understands that this is simply unacceptable. We are committed to developing the conditions and the supports that are needed for inclusive economic growth, which are going to help Ontarians, regardless of their gender, realize their full potential.", "It’s not only about social equality and fairness; it’s also an economic one. Our government is seizing the opportunity to take action. Our proposed legislation that you have before you, if passed by this House, would help address gender and other biases in hiring and pay setting. It would assist those job applicants and employers to negotiate compensation based on the job requirements and an applicant’s qualifications, not their gender. It would promote fair compensation practices by requiring prescribed employers to report on pay data and on the composition of their workforce. These changes are going to benefit all Ontarians—women and men, employees and employers alike.", "The legislation, if passed, would prohibit Ontario employers from asking job applicants about their prior salary. That simply makes sense, Speaker.", "It requires employers to indicate a pay scale or an amount for all publicly advertised job vacancies. What it would do—and this comes to the fore in a lot of other legislation I deal with—is it prohibits employers from engaging in reprisals against workers simply for exercising their rights, in this case, for discussing their compensation with their employer or with other employees at the same firm. It requires prescribed employers to report to the government on pay gaps and workforce composition by gender and other characteristics of diversity.", "We have consulted very broadly on this. We’ve talked to a number of employers, worker representatives, advocates, businesses and other stakeholders. If the bill is passed, we intend to continue with that consultation to make sure as these come into effect, that employers and employees and stakeholders feel a part of this process and we make sure that the implementation is done in a meaningful way, an effective way and is done in a very transparent way.", "Speaker, in the past we have made progress towards gender equality by passing anti-discrimination legislation. We’ve got the Human Rights Code, we’ve got the Pay Equity Act and we’ve got equal pay for equal work provisions of the Employment Standards Act that are coming into effect April 1 of this year. We’ve also begun to remove barriers for women by taking actions such as investing in child care, full-day kindergarten and affordable housing and by addressing gender-based violence. But we all know full well in this House, Speaker, that there’s a lot more work to be done.", "The Pay Transparency Act is a new tool in our tool kit that is going to help promote workplace equity. It’s going to help shine a light on unwarranted pay inequities and various biases that may exist today in workplace practices, thereby helping employers to eliminate them. We are not saying, as a government, that we are introducing this act or this initiative and then the work is over—far from it. We know that the work towards achieving full gender equality must, and will, continue.", "Just before International Women’s Day this year, we launched Then Now Next: Ontario’s Strategy for Women’s Economic Empowerment. It’s the first strategy of its kind in this country, so we can be proud of that here in Ontario. It’s a landmark that everybody in this province should celebrate.", "It’s good for everyone when women do well, when their communities are safe, when our daughters, our moms, our sisters, our girlfriends and wives can have the same opportunities as everybody else in this province. We know that increasing women’s economic participation is the right thing to do for the sake of equality, but it’s also the right thing to do for the economy.", "I would like to go a little further in explaining the benefits of closing the gender wage gap for the economy and for business in this province. Research shows very clearly that besides increasing women’s economic security and creating more equitable workplaces, eliminating the wage gap would benefit the entire economy and individual businesses. A recent study suggests that if women were fully engaged in the economy, it would add $60 billion to Ontario’s annual GDP by 2026. That’s right, Speaker: $60 billion.", "The Royal Bank of Canada in 2005 estimated that personal incomes in Canada would increase by about $168 billion annually if women had the same labour force opportunities that men enjoy. That’s $168 billion, Speaker. TD Economics reported that raising women’s participation in paid work by just 1% could add 115,000 workers to Canada’s workforce.", "Research has shown very clearly as well that those workplaces that establish gender equity are more likely to have a competitive advantage when it comes to attracting highly skilled workers. It reduces the cost of employee turnover and demonstrates better organizational and financial performance. I’m sure we’re all in favour of that, Speaker. That’s a good thing.", "Then Now Next, the province’s new strategy for women’s economic empowerment, lays out a three-year plan to increase gender equity, to challenge biases and to eliminate barriers that women face at work, at home and in their community. What we propose to do, Speaker, in order to uncover those organizational pay gaps, is we have a strategy that is included in the introduction of the Pay Transparency Act before this House. What it would do is it would increase transparency in the hiring process and protect employees who discuss their pay from reprisals.", "That’s probably one of the clearest signs that the world is changing. It used to be considered bad form, or it used to be considered something you didn’t do to talk about your own pay with anybody else within the company. It was something that employers certainly asked you not to do, and people felt there would be retribution if they did that. What we’re saying is that doesn’t work and that hasn’t worked in the past. We wouldn’t have a gender wage gap, Speaker, if that had been a good thing. So we’re protecting employees who exercise their rights from reprisals. It’s going to require prescribed employers to disclose aggregate pay gaps within their own organization based on gender.", "What we would do by passing this bill is the province of Ontario would look at those other jurisdictions around the world that we view as having a progressive approach to this, where they’ve taken certain measures and those measures have worked. If you look at Australia, if you look at the UK, you look at Germany, you look at the US states of California and Massachusetts, what they’ve done is create conditions that bring more transparency to pay setting and hence encourage employers to tackle those unjustified pay discrepancies for women and for other groups.", "The new empowerment strategy, Speaker, is building on a very strong foundation of action that we brought forward in Ontario. What it includes is increasing choice for parents by transforming our early years and child care system and helping the families of 100,000 more children under the age of four access licensed child care over the next five years. We’ve implemented full-day kindergarten, something people told us we couldn’t do. We’ve expanded before- and after-school care. We’re seeing more women move out of poverty by introducing a fair minimum wage as part of a very historic action to help workers. We’re removing barriers to post-secondary education with the new OSAP.", "Moving forward with this empowerment strategy makes good sense, but as I said, it’s been a process getting here. Many individuals and groups have been supportive and have been a strong part of that process. I want to thank the members of the gender wage gap steering committee, the gender wage gap consultation working group, the participants in the Ministry of the Status of Women consultations, and the Women in Business Steering Committee. It’s because of their hard work that we’re well-informed to take the next steps on the road to gender equity in the workplace and beyond in Ontario.", "Speaker, it’s been 30 years since pay equity legislation was passed in this province. The Pay Equity Office plays a very important role in closing the gender wage gap. Various stakeholders, including women’s advocacy groups, have told us they’d like to see this organization strengthened. That’s why, as part of this new strategy, it will be strengthened.", "Progress has taken time. It has taken too much time and a lot of hard work, and that makes the title of Then Now Next really such a fitting name for this strategy. It acknowledges, as I said, all the work that came before. It acknowledges the action plan we’re putting in place now, and it points to the work that remains.", "But even quantifying the problem can seem daunting, and that’s why we brought forward this pay transparency legislation to the House. We’re the first province in this great country to do so. It’s why we’re going to require all publicly advertised job postings to include the expected pay or a pay range.", "I think the most exciting part of that bill, Speaker, is that, if passed, it would require prescribed businesses to prepare some pay transparency information for us, to get this out in the open, to talk about it more freely. They would be asked to provide information about their own workforce composition and the differences in compensation with respect to gender and other prescribed characteristics. Basically, Speaker, we’re going to shine a light on an issue that really should have been resolved a long time ago.", "Knowing the stats is a huge step forward because this information is not being shared today. It’s not known by employees or by the general public and sometimes not known by management. This bill, if passed, would prescribe employers to send their pay transparency to the province. They’ll be asked to post that information online, so it will be very transparent. Men and women across the province of Ontario will have full access to that information.", "We’re a major employer in the province of Ontario. The OPS, the Ontario public service, hires a lot of people, so our province’s pay-transparency disclosure measures are going to begin right here at home. The exact reporting requirements for employers, such as what, how and when to report, will be determined with consultations with the various stakeholders themselves.", "Before I sit down, I just want to ask for the support of the entire House for this piece of legislation. Our proposed legislation is in line with other leading jurisdictions in the world that have made more progress than we have. It’s time for Ontario to lead, and certainly I think we have examples around the world of how we can accomplish that.", "I will now pass it off to the Minister of the Status of Women." ],

The gap in pay between men and women hasn’t improved for more than a decade, and we must close that gap. The wage gap is even greater for racialized, newcomer and indigenous women and for women with disabilities, LGBTQ+ women and women in rural and remote communities. This cannot continue.", "A year ago, the status of women was created as a full ministry, with a mandate to take a government-wide approach to supporting women, from eliminating violence and harassment to pressing for gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. We have been working hard to fulfill the mandate under the leadership of our Premier, Kathleen Wynne. Premier Wynne has been a strong leader for women and is committed to full gender equality for women and girls in Ontario. That’s because we are committed to a province that cares about everyone equally and fairly.", "When the Premier appointed me as the Minister of the Status of Women in January, I was both grateful and very determined to take this opportunity to work to make life better for women and girls across the province and to help break down the barriers that stand in the way of equality. This is why my ministry has launched two major new strategies over the past several weeks and helped introduce this pay transparency legislation.", "Earlier this month, Ontario hosted the first women’s empowerment summit. We heard from women who are defining their field, making history and building a stronger society. Along with the Premier and the Minister of Labour, we launched Then Now Next: Ontario’s Strategy for Women’s Economic Empowerment. It is the first whole-of-government approach to economic empowerment in Canada. The goal is to build a stronger and more inclusive economy by reducing the barriers and biases that prevent women’s full participation.", "Our government will be taking action in a number of areas:", "—We’re establishing an Ontario women’s entrepreneurship association to increase women’s access and opportunity and to scale up and extend ventures;", "—We’re implementing a plan to promote women in corporate leadership positions, including on public and private sector boards. To reinforce this plan, we will leverage government buying power to encourage gender equity when selecting vendors for government work;", "—We’re encouraging large firms that sign new government contracts to reach a target of 30% women on private sector boards;", "—We’re increasing annual funding for Investing in Women’s Futures, a provincial program that aims to provide supports to women experiencing violence and promote women’s economic independence;", "—We’re investing in opportunities for mentorship and networking for women who face higher barriers, including newcomer and racialized women. We’ll also do more to support leadership amongst young women and continue to support indigenous women’s leadership;", "—Finally, we are working to bring more transparency and fairness to practices around hiring and pay, which brings us now to the Pay Transparency Act, 2018, this historic legislation that is before the House today.", "If passed, the legislation will bring increased transparency in hiring and it will offer protection for employees who discuss their pay.", "Employers will also need to be transparent about their organizational pay gaps based on gender and other characteristics, and to report back to the government. This will give women the information they need to negotiate a fair wage. It will allow women’s contributions at work to be valued equally to men’s contributions.", "A lack of information about pay is one of the biggest barriers preventing women from benefiting equally from the economy. Right now, they don’t benefit in the same way and they don’t have as many economic choices as men. That’s because we know that women are more likely to reduce their hours to do unpaid work at home. They’re streamed into lower-paying jobs, which are usually traditionally feminine jobs such as caregiving, and that work is often insecure.", "Not enough women are reaching leadership positions. Women make up 45% of the people entering the workforce, but only 20% of vice-presidents and 15% of CEOs. These barriers stand in the way of women’s economic empowerment. That’s what our strategy Then Now Next intends to change.", "In order to create change, it’s important to have women equally represented in the workforce and in leadership at all levels. Consider the impact of women on leadership in politics. You don’t have to go too far back to remember a time when the political arena in Ontario and Canada looked very different from what it does today. But today, as a woman and a woman of colour in cabinet, I represent the changing face of politics.", "In January, when Premier Kathleen Wynne appointed me as the Minister of the Status of Women, two of my fellow women colleagues were also appointed as ministers. With these changes, our cabinet now stands at 45% women, a figure very close to parity. I believe that having more women in positions of influence—not just in government but in all areas of our lives—helps to bring about positive change.", "You can see how this is playing out right now at the province level. Under the leadership of Premier Kathleen Wynne, our government has created a new stand-alone Ministry of the Status of Women.", "We’ve introduced a job-protected leave of absence for workers who have experienced domestic or sexual violence.", "We’ve rolled out more quality, affordable child care spaces, because affordable child care has been identified as one of the fundamental issues that needs to be addressed to close the gender wage gap.", "We’ve also created affordable tuition for young women starting school and for older women who need to upgrade their skills to enter the workplace.", "These changes are needed because a range of barriers has been preventing women from having the lives they want for themselves: barriers such as gender discrimination, gender streaming in occupations, racism, colonialism and poverty. For women, there is also the added barrier of escaping unsafe living situations for themselves and their families.", "We know that in order to fully empower women economically, we need to work to remove any barriers that may prevent them from finding more meaningful paid work.", "We have heard the stories of women who continue to live in dangerous situations because they can’t find safety. We have heard survivors of sexual violence and harassment say #MeToo. We know that women are waiting days, weeks and months to receive counselling services, and we know that survivors struggle to navigate the legal system.", "Everyone deserves to feel safe in their communities, workplaces, homes and schools. That’s why our government has just launched It’s Never Okay: Ontario’s Gender-Based Violence Strategy. Through this strategy, we are building on our long-standing leadership and our commitment to ending gender-based violence. It’s Never Okay: Ontario’s Gender-Based Violence Strategy will stand on progress already made through the Domestic Violence Action Plan, the Action Plan to Stop Sexual Violence and Harassment, the Long-Term Strategy to End Violence Against Indigenous Women, and Ontario’s Strategy to End Human Trafficking.", "Speaker, you may remember It’s Never Okay and the #WhoWillYouHelp campaign, which we launched in 2015 as a part of our action plan to stop sexual violence and harassment. The campaign started a conversation not just in Ontario but across the globe. We promised, with It’s Never Okay, that our work was to be continued. Now, through the new Gender-Based Violence Strategy, this government will invest up to $242 million to help build on these successful government investments so that survivors and their families get the help that they need.", "Last fall, we sat down with agencies and people with lived experiences with violence from right across Ontario. We heard from more than 200 agencies that provide services related to gender-based violence as well as more than 100 people with lived experiences. I want to thank those who shared their experiences and their stories with us. You helped build this strategy.", "I would like to once again extend my thanks to the violence against women round table. The conversation, advice, expertise and knowledge from the violence against women round table has helped us ensure that this strategy is meaningful and significant to all survivors.", "We know that there’s more that we need to do to stop gender-based violence. We know that by intervening early and effectively, particularly with young people, we can begin to break the cycle of violence before it even begins. Through public education, the strategy will change attitudes and norms that drive gender-based violence.", "We know that by taking these necessary steps, we are creating a safe space for survivors. It is in that safe space that women will have the full opportunity to reach their economic potential, and they will have the same opportunity to benefit equally from the economy. It is time for economic empowerment for all women. It is time for equity, and it is time for fairness. This legislation, the Pay Transparency Act, 2018, if passed, will take us one step closer to achieving this goal.", "The gender wage gap is real: Taken as yearly pay, women in Canada make just 74 cents on the dollar compared to men, and that gap has been stuck at about 30% for over 10 years, since 2007. This means that it takes most women on average 15 and a half months to earn what a man makes in one year. This gap is even worse for indigenous, immigrant and racialized women. Women are most likely to reduce their hours to do unpaid work at home, and they’re streamed into those lower-paying jobs. Not enough women are reaching leadership positions.", "By taking these steps, we’re creating fairer workplaces by increasing transparency of pay and workforce composition, strengthening Ontario’s Pay Equity Office and expanding and strengthening women’s centres which provide low-barrier, wraparound and pre-employment services for marginalized and vulnerable women. We are creating fairer workplaces, changing perspectives about gender and promoting women’s leadership, access to jobs and career advancement.", "Women can be equally empowered in our economy. That is why the Pay Transparency Act is needed. If passed, it is a positive step forward. It is changing a system that will break down the barriers that women face in today’s society.", "By making this change, we are making a difference. There are so many women here today who are making a difference, too, in big and small ways, but that work is not valued in the same way.", "I grew up in a home with people who understood the importance of being active in the community and the value of making life better for everyone. I’ve seen first-hand the incredible difference that that can make, whether that’s by influencing decision-making, giving your time to help others, excelling in your field, being a positive role model for young women, or demanding equal pay for equal work.", "Together, we will build a strong and equal future for ourselves and for all women and girls, a future where women can truly have an equal voice, equal pay and equal opportunities.", "I encourage all members to vote in favour this bill." ],

There is an abundance of teachers, and this government saw fit to address that by making it a two-year course through teachers’ college instead of a one-year course, which only, really, doubles the cost of education. That’s simply all it did.", "I think that there needs to be some more work around generating good jobs in the area. When you look at fields that used to be guaranteed jobs, with an example of engineering—my son graduated from Queen’s University in civil engineering. After, he went out to work in Alberta, of course, as there was an abundance of jobs out there. He came back and he ran into some of his friends in Toronto who, two or three years after graduation, were in Toronto looking for jobs in their field. They were working as waitresses and different—basically, underemployed. One of his friends moved out west, and within three days she had a job in the engineering field.", "When I graduated, Ontario was the place to work. We had almost the opposite problem: There were more jobs than there were people graduating. Right now, if you talk to the professional engineering group—this government talks about needing more engineers to fill the jobs, but they talk about the huge number of unemployed engineers they have in Ontario. It’s a huge problem for them. There are graduates coming out with no place to work, and—I guess my time is running out—we see the same thing in the medical field.", "Thank you." ],

As long as this government continues to focus on the corporate model of child care, you are running exactly in the opposite direction of making affordable child care a reality for working women in the province of Ontario. Twenty-eight percent of women in this province identify that they only work part-time because they can only find part-time care. How can you ever achieve economic equality when affordable, quality child care is so far out of reach?", "Queer Ontario came out with a statement today based on Bill 3. This is what they say about the gender pay gap: “The gender pay gap in Ontario between women and men has stagnated at 30% over the past three (3) decades. Lesbian and bisexual women can be particularly impacted and trans women are even further challenged by the gender binary in work settings. Greater enforcement of pay equity laws is required, along with a broader, more inclusive understanding of gender variance.

I think it’s apparent to all three parties in the House. It sounds like the NDP will be supportive. I’m not sure about the official opposition yet, but I hope that all parties will find some way to be able to move forward on this, because the work we’ve been able to accomplish so far with our tremendous partners began in the Premier’s mandate letter that I got back in 2014. They asked that I work with the then-minister responsible for women’s issues, Tracy MacCharles, to lead the development of a wage-gap strategy, something that was actually going to close the gap in the context of a 21st century economy.", "It has been a complex task—some of the people who have helped us out are in the members’ gallery today—but it’s a crucial task, and it’s one we’re committed to ensuring that we continue on this journey and that we close that gender wage gap completely. What we did is that we also took a broader review of Ontario’s system of employment and of labour standards, and we’re developing the reforms that the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka was talking about.", "Ontarians are very supportive of the reforms that have taken place under Bill 148.

  "text" : [ "I am very pleased to rise today as the women’s issues critic for the Ontario NDP caucus to offer some comments on Bill 3, the Pay Transparency Act.", "Certainly, we know that the wage gap is not new. This has been a persistent feature of Ontario’s labour market for well over 30 years. Thirty years ago is when we had the Pay Equity Act, but it was the existence of the wage gap that led to the introduction of that legislation.", "We have seen, over those last 30 years and definitely in the 15 years that the Liberals have been in office, that Pay Equity Act has made virtually no difference in terms of narrowing that gap, closing that gap and making a difference for women in this province. This Liberal government has had 15 years in office to do something meaningful to try to close that gender pay gap, but it has waited until its dying days, the eleventh hour of its mandate, to introduce this legislation. If this actually was a priority for Kathleen Wynne and this Liberal government, they would have tackled it much earlier.", "One year ago—or almost a year ago—on April 11, 2017, I did bring in a motion calling on the government to pass pay transparency legislation. So to some degree, I’m heartened that the government has moved forward with Bill 3.", "Having said that, the content of the legislation matters. We have heard from people who have been working on this file for years that there are a lot of inadequacies in the legislation that we have before us today. In Bill 3, the requirements for the application of the legislation to the public service, then to employers with over 500 employees and then to employers with 250 employees—those requirements don’t even match the obligations that Ontario employers currently have under the Pay Equity Act, which applies to all employers with 10 or more employees in this province. The requirements of Bill 3 don’t come near to matching an employer’s requirements under the Ontario Human Rights Code, which obligates every single employer in this province not to discriminate on the basis of gender.", "So what we see here today is a half measure that is almost symbolic in nature, that is trying to placate those people who have been working on this issue for so long to try to really make a difference for women in this province.", "We know that the gender wage gap is real and that action is needed to close it. As I said, we have a pay gap that has remained fairly constant at around 30% for four decades. Since the 1980s, the gap has nudged 6% smaller, but we are still stuck at that 30% that we just can’t seem to get beyond. What this means, Speaker, when you think about what a 30% wage gap means: If a man were to retire today at age 65, a woman would have to keep on working until she was 79 years of age in order to have the same income, the same kind of earnings on retirement as her male counterpart.", "Another way to think about what the gender pay gap means, what this 30% gap means, is to think about Equal Pay Day. Equal Pay Day is coming up in Ontario on April 10. Equal Pay Day marks how long into the next year a woman has to work in order to earn the same kinds of wages that her male counterpart had earned in the prior year. In other words, women in Ontario have to work the full calendar year plus all of January, plus all of February, plus all of March, and the first week and a half of April in order to have comparable earnings to what a man in Ontario would have had.", "This has meant that when Ontario is measured against other jurisdictions, Ontario does not rate very highly in terms of its commitment to gender wage equality. There was a report from the Conference Board of Canada that marked Ontario with a C grade—a grade of C, toward the low end of the pack—in terms of its efforts to reduce gender wage inequality.", "Ontario’s annual sunshine list, which we just saw this week or last week, repeatedly, year after year, shows that maybe a quarter of the people on that list are women. Women are consistently underrepresented on the sunshine list, which, of course, only compares wages for those who earn over $100,000. That actually isn’t even scientific information. That’s just from a scan of the list, because it’s not actually reported by gender, but some interpretation of the sunshine list can be made based on the names of the people who are on the list.", "This gender pay gap in Ontario has been recognized as a systemic issue. When you look at the efforts that have been made to address it, it is not related to individual women who aren’t good negotiators in terms of negotiating a salary increase in their office. It’s not related to the jobs that women want to get into or the careers that they are interested in pursuing. Nor does it relate to the practices of some employers. There is a systemic set of issues in the labour force that disadvantage women and have disadvantaged them for years. This is related both to the failure of provincial governments to implement strong pay equity laws and enforce those laws, and to provide the resources necessary to enforce those laws, and also the lack of accommodation for women’s care responsibilities, among other things.", "Speaker, the other thing to keep in mind about the gender wage gap is that it has to be looked at by which women are most disadvantaged. We know that for indigenous women, the gap is much, much greater than 30%. Indigenous women face a 57% wage gap. Women with disabilities face a 46% wage gap. Immigrant women face a 39% wage gap. Racialized women face a 32% wage gap. That is all calculated on the basis of Statistics Canada data and census data.", "We also know that the wage gap persists regardless of level of education, regardless of occupation. There are 500 occupations that are tracked by Stats Canada in its Canadian income statistics data, and of those 500 occupations, women are paid less than men in 469 of them.", "I mentioned education. We also know, looking at the earnings six months after graduation for post-secondary students, that university graduates who are women are paid less from their very, very first jobs, from the first time they enter the labour force after graduation, compared to their male classmates who graduate from the same program in the same year and who get jobs in the exact same field.", "I do want to do a shout-out to OUSA, the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance. In 2015, three years ago, they launched a campaign to bring attention to the impact of the gender wage gap on post-secondary students in Ontario. They pointed out that female university graduates make an average of about $300,000 less over the course of their career compared to male university graduates. Their campaign focused on what they called the “bachelorette degree,” to point out the absolute hypocrisy of granting degrees in our post-secondary institutions that are supposed to enable young people to enter careers in the occupations that they have dreamed of, and yet women are earning degrees that are valued much less or much lower in the labour market—what they called a “bachelorette degree.” That is absolutely unacceptable in this province and at this time.", "I mentioned earlier the sunshine list. Certainly we know that the sunshine list does provide what some people have called a small window into equity and inequity in terms of pay for women and men. We saw that in 2016. An analysis that was done by the Toronto Star showed that women on the list earned an average of $124,000, while men made $130,000. There were twice as many men as women who were making more than $162,000. In the 2017 list, there were only four women who were in the top 20 spots on the sunshine list, even as this Liberal government claimed that it was on track to close the wage gap.", "I have to say, Speaker, that I was disappointed, quite frankly, in the response of the then-minister responsible for women’s issues when she was asked to comment on the 2017 sunshine list. She noted that it had been 30 years since Ontario passed the Pay Equity Act, and she said that she hoped that there would be a “trickle-down” effect as more women continued to advance within the government. I appreciate that the government has moved away from hoping that there would be a trickle-down effect to actually recognizing the need to introduce much stronger measures to try to close the gender wage gap.", "I want to talk for a bit about the current legislative framework that is in place to address wage inequities and how the Pay Transparency Act will fit into the current protections. Right now in Canada there are basically four kinds of legal remedies that women can use if they are discriminated against on the basis of pay in the labour market.", "First we have the Employment Standards Act, which really talks about equal pay for equal work. The Employment Standards Act requires employers to ensure that all employees are paid equally for what is essentially equal work. There were some changes made to the Employment Standards Act through Bill 148; hopefully those will strengthen the protections that used to be in place under the Employment Standards Act. But quite honestly, the Employment Standards Act protections were very narrow because, as I said, it was an apples-to-apples comparison of equal pay for equal work.", "The other key protection is the Pay Equity Act, which I have already mentioned. We had pay equity legislation brought into this province in the 1980s, and that was really a step beyond the Employment Standards Act because it talked about equal pay for work of equal value, which, as you can imagine, Speaker, is significant because there are a lot of occupations where when you’re looking at equal pay for equal work, there are no men, or very few men, who are employed in those occupations. Therefore, equal-pay-for-equal-work principles don’t really offer the same kinds of protections for female workers.", "The third legal protection that currently exists is the Ontario Human Rights Code. As I mentioned at the outset, the Ontario Human Rights Code applies to every employer in this province. It prohibits unequal treatment on the basis of employment and a number of other factors.", "Finally, there are charter protections. There is a charter guarantee of gender equality that also can contribute to protecting women from pay discrimination in the workplace.", "Unfortunately, Speaker, as I have noted, none of these four legal protections have actually had the impact that we would want to see in terms of closing that gender wage gap, and that is related to a number of issues. I want to speak specifically about the Pay Equity Act and some of the limitations of the Pay Equity Act in addressing the gender wage gap.", "The pay equity legislation required workforce analyses to determine proportional values and to establish comparator proxies where there were few or no men in the workplace. As I mentioned, the Pay Equity Act did have a modest impact. It reduced the gender wage gap by 6%. However, it did not have the widespread impact that one would hope. There’s also the problem that many workers are currently excluded from the Pay Equity Act, particularly those who are in very small workplaces—workplaces with under 10 employees—and also workplaces that are not unionized.", "One of the biggest impediments, however, to the effectiveness of the Pay Equity Act was what the Conservatives did to the Pay Equity Commission when they were in office. We know that they gutted the funding that was available to the Pay Equity Commission to enforce the act. Previously, until the Conservatives took office, the Pay Equity Commission was allocated approximately $6 million to do its work to enforce the act. Under the Conservatives, that amount, that allocation, was cut in half, to about $3 million. Now, Speaker, over the last 15 years that the Liberals have been in office, what we have seen is basically flatlined resources provided to the Pay Equity Commission. It has never recovered from that drastic cut that was implemented by the Conservative government.", "The other thing that the Conservatives did which really had a negative impact on the effectiveness of the pay equity legislation was to eliminate the pay equity legal clinic. This was an essential and valuable tool to assist low-income and non-unionized women to enforce their rights. This gutting of the publicly funded pay equity legal clinic and cutting in half the resources that were available to the Pay Equity Commission really restricted the ability of the commission to enforce pay equity laws in this province.", "We saw the Pay Equity Commission file its annual reports and we saw, year after year, reports showing the numbers of cases that were opened and also the length of time that was being taken to actually close a case. In 2010, the annual report said that it was taking three years for an investigation to be completed and resolved. In 2011, 88% of cases were taking up to three years for investigation and resolution. Similarly, year after year, the Pay Equity Commission is reporting that it takes years in order to follow up on a concern about pay equity or a lack of pay equity adherence in their place of employment.", "Speaker, in addition to the fact that the Liberals didn’t restore the funding to the Pay Equity Commission that was eliminated by the Conservatives, the other concern that has been highlighted by people around the effectiveness of the Pay Equity Act is the fact that the government itself was resisting adhering to its obligations under the act. We know that the government was going to court to try to resist its obligations to implement pay equity in the broader public sector. We heard that last year several MPPs, I am sure, met with the developmental services workers, who were here as part of an OPSEU delegation, who talked about the fight that they have been engaged in for decades to try to achieve the pay equity that they are legally entitled to under the act.", "Not only has the government gone to the Pay Equity Hearings Tribunal to resist its own obligations, the government has refused to work with agencies that are publicly funded to make sure that those agencies can meet their pay equity obligations. This is a huge issue in the developmental services sector, which is a female-dominated sector. It is staffed by women who are often the most vulnerable and they are completely shut out of their rights to equal pay under the Pay Equity Act.", "Certainly, the Pay Equity Act has been very limited in making inroads for women in this province. And so, again, I’m pleased to see that we have come to this point where we recognize that there is a need for another tool, that there is a need for additional legislative protections to help close that gender wage gap, because the current protections that we have in place have not been effective.", "What we saw last year is that the Equal Pay Coalition came to Queen’s Park. They had a media conference and were supported by many legal scholars, activists and advocates who have been working on this file for years. They proposed pay transparency legislation as an effective tool to help really try to jump start what needs to happen in order to close that gender wage gap. When they came to Queen’s Park, they brought with them legislation that was already drafted, and it was really strong legislation. One of the features of that legislation—which, sadly, we don’t see in Bill 3 that is before us today—was a preamble that very clearly situated the right to equal pay as a—" ],

That is what a human right is.", "You can’t say that workers who work in firms with 250 employees and more, their human rights should be protected, but that workers who work in firms with less than 250 employees don’t need their human rights, that it’s not a concern." ],

The rationale for that is because that’s how the Pay Equity Act is structured. The Pay Equity Act applies to every employer in this province who has at least 10 employees, so a pay transparency legislation should parallel what is currently in place with the Employment Equity Act.", "Unfortunately, as I mentioned, the legislation that we have before us today does not do that. It does not follow the current provisions of the Pay Equity Act, and it has a much more limited application.", "The Equal Pay Coalition also provided some of the other jurisdictions that are already taking action on this. They encourage the Ontario government to look at those other jurisdictions and develop legislation that would reflect some of what’s happening around the world.", "In Quebec, there’s a Pay Equity Act that includes an obligation for filing annual online public reports on pay equity compliance, which is a form of pay transparency.

It applies to companies with 35 employees or more.", "In Belgium, in 2012, a new law was adopted to reduce the gender wage gap. It applied to firms with 50 employees or more.", "In Australia, the legislation has been in place since 2012, pay transparency legislation that applies to all private sector employers with 100 employees or more.", "Finally, Speaker, in the UK, pay transparency reports were required through legislation as of April 2017, and it applies to all employers with 250 employees or more.", "There are lots of examples around the world of jurisdictions that are moving forward with pay transparency. They are requiring a much greater range of employers to comply with their legislation compared to what we see this Liberal government doing. In fact, what we understand the Liberal government intends to do was outlined in a press release because it’s not actually in the bill. It’s part of the regulations that will later accompany the bill, but we understand that the government’s intent is that the Pay Transparency Act will begin with the public sector. Then, following an unspecified period of consultation with the private sector, the government intends to apply the legislation to employers with 500 employees or more. Then, after another unspecified period of consultation, there is the possibility that this legislation will apply to employers with 250 employees or more.", "This is a problem, Speaker, when we see Ontario dragging its feet, lagging behind the actions that have been taken in other jurisdictions in the face of a wage gap that, as I said, has remained virtually unchanged for 30 years.", "When the Equal Pay Coalition was here last year, I have to say there was a lot of support for the legislation that they introduced.", "As I mentioned, I brought in a motion calling on the government to pass pay transparency legislation, expecting that the government would take up the draft that had already been written by the Equal Pay Coalition and move forward with it. Some of the people who responded to the initiative of the Equal Pay Coalition recognized the value of the pay transparency legislation to require annual mandatory reporting by private and public sector employers as a means of finally reducing the gender wage gap.", "We also know that some of the provisions of the Equal Pay Coalition’s draft legislation have been incorporated into Bill 3 by the Liberal government, which is a positive thing. We know that protecting employees from reprisal if they disclose their salary is very important, to create that transparency in the workplace, to shine a light on what individual employees are earning, by gender or by other characteristics. Those reprisal protections are very important.", "In fact, there was a study done by the Harvard Business Review that talked about the fact that there was a survey revealing that 41% of workers in the US were discouraged from talking about their pay, and a shocking 25% of workers feared retribution if they had a conversation or a discussion about what they were earning. So protecting workers from retribution if they disclose their salaries is really important, because it is a very real fear among workers.", "The Harvard Business Review study was also quite interesting because they pointed out that employers, for years and years, have had access to data on compensation. HR managers across the country use these compensation surveys to try to decide what salary they’re going to attach to positions in order to bring in the talent they’re looking for. These compensation surveys have been very helpful to employers in determining the composition of their workplace and the salaries that they’re going to have in place.", "The article in the Harvard Business Review notes: “These surveys are rightly justified on the grounds that hiring firms want to offer competitive salaries. But the problem lies in the asymmetry between the information available to managers compared to workers. In a wide array of circumstances, economic studies have found that the entity with more and better information comes out ahead. The labour market is likely no different.”", "So it’s important that workers have the same kind of access to data about what their co-workers are earning and what employees in different employment situations are earning, so that we can try to rectify that imbalance that has existed.", "We also know that many Canadians see the value of pay transparency legislation. There was another survey that was done in Canada, just in February of this year, by Maclean’s magazine. They asked people to state their agreement with the following statement: “I would be comfortable with my salary being made public if it could reveal salary inequity.” Nearly three quarters of Canadians, 73%—and 81% of the women who responded to the survey—agreed with that statement. So 73% of all respondents said that they would be comfortable with their salary being made public if it could reveal unfair discrepancies between men and women’s wages.", "This timidity by this government in worrying about what is going to happen if they apply this new legislation to employers, who are already obligated under the Pay Equity Act, is really unfounded, because we know that there’s a lot of support among working people in Canada and in this province for pay transparency legislation that applies to a broad range of workers.", "I’m going to move now to Bill 3 and talk a little bit about the background to this bill. As we heard from the Minister of Labour, he was given a mandate to work with the minister responsible for women’s issues to lead the development of a gender wage strategy. Now, I do want to comment for the moment on the process that led to the report of the gender wage gap steering committee and, eventually, to this legislation, which was just announced last week or earlier this month as part of the women’s empowerment strategy.", "We saw in this province, for the last two years, a focused effort to solicit the input of employers and workers across this province on changes to the Labour Relations Act and the Employment Standards Act. By comparison, when this government was looking at closing the gender wage gap, there was a glaring discrepancy between those two processes in terms of the resources that were allocated to the initiative and in terms of the kind of profile that the initiative got.", "The gender wage gap steering committee, who did remarkable work, really valuable work in developing their recommendations, were basically working as volunteers compared to the two retired judges who led the Changing Workplaces Review and the process of coming up with Bill 148. But that is just an aside. I wanted to get that on the record, because I think it’s worth reflecting on the kind of prioritization that this government gave to coming up with useful strategies to close the gender wage gap.", "Looking specifically at this bill and the contents of the bill, what it does is it prohibits employers from asking job applicants about their compensation history, so what they may have earned in previous positions. The applicant can disclose to the employer that information, but the employer is prohibited from asking about that. Employers who publicly advertise jobs have to give information about the expected compensation or expected compensation range, and then employers must file pay transparency reports with the ministry for review. Actually, we’re not sure which ministry, because the legislation currently does not identify which minister is responsible. That apparently will be addressed in regulation, along with a number of other missing pieces in this bill. But anyway, these pay transparency reports have to be submitted to the ministry. Then they must also be posted online, or in at least one visible place in each workplace. The ministry is also able to post the reports publicly in hard copy or online.", "The bill establishes anti-reprisal provisions for employees who inquire about compensation, who disclose their compensation to their co-workers, who inquire about the pay transparency reports and who ask their employer to comply with the Pay Transparency Act, and also employees who disclose information about the employer’s compliance or non-compliance with the act.", "The bill also provides that employees can make official complaints directly to the Ontario Labour Relations Board or, if they have a complaint about their employer’s compliance with the act, they can also deal with the matter through arbitration under a collective agreement, if there is a collective agreement in place.", "The important part of this legislation, and any pay transparency legislation, is that it shifts the onus of proof from the employee to the employer. So really, it shines that light on whether employers are actually complying with their existing legal obligations under those pieces of legislation that I mentioned earlier: the Pay Equity Act, the Employment Standards Act, the Ontario Human Rights Code and also the charter. The Labour Relations Board can take on an arbitration process.", "There are compliance officers who can conduct a compliance audit of an employer without need for a warrant. The act also mentions financial penalties for contravening the act. What those financial penalties are, we don’t know. However, those penalties are to be paid to the Minister of Finance.", "One of the big concerns with this legislation, as with so many pieces of Liberal legislation, is that far too much of the act is left to the regulations. The act states that the Lieutenant Governor in Council can make regulations about the content of the report, how often the reports are going to be required to be filed, who is going to be required to file them, whether employers can be exempted from filing reports, what kind of penalties are going to exist for not complying with the act, and which minister and ministry are going to be responsible for the administration of the act and other regulatory issues. There is a lot that is not spelled out in this act that we have heard from this government today and in press releases, but we will have to wait until we actually see the regulations to see how this act is going to work.", "In response to this Bill 3, which was initially introduced as Bill 203, there have been a number of concerns identified. Specifically, the Equal Pay Coalition has pointed out that the reporting requirements that the Liberals have announced that they are intending to proceed with fall far short of other jurisdictions’, the other countries that I mentioned, and that they don’t match the legal obligations already in place under the Pay Equity Act and the Ontario Human Rights Code.", "The other issue that they pointed out is that civil service workers’ pay structures are already transparent. As I said, those civil servants who earn over $100,000 are named on the sunshine list; unionized employees have their salary structures or their pay rates already set out in publicly available collective agreements. So for the Liberals to say, “We’re going to introduce this legislation and we’re going to start with the OPS,” really won’t make that much of a difference, because we already know what the pay rates are for OPS employees. Those are already set out in collective agreements.", "Some of the other concerns that have been identified: A lawyer, Inna Koldorf, says that companies are going to find ways around the legislation by advertising broad ranges of salary. We don’t know. It’s going to be in the regs, what has to be reported, but currently the act does contemplate that there will be salary ranges included in this report. This lawyer, Inna Koldorf, says, “What glares at me right now is the fact that there’s a permission to use ranges as opposed to just salary rates. And I think that’s going to give employers a lot of flexibility when it comes to publicly advertising information.”", "There is the concern that a class of employers can be exempted from the act, which can refer to either employers with certain numbers of employees or to entire sectors of employers. That gives this government, or whoever is responsible for administering this act, quite a lot of flexibility if there were an interest in restricting the application of the act.", "An interesting observation was made by AMAPCEO, the union that represents 14,000 professional public servants. They point out that the new legislation will prohibit employers from asking job candidates about their past compensation; however, the sunshine list reports the salaries, by name, of all public servants who are earning over $100,000. Employers will be able to do a Google and potentially find out what a job candidate had been earning in their last position in the OPS. AMAPCEO has called on the government to remove the names of individual employees from the sunshine list, while still identifying job titles and salaries, to close this loophole and to provide privacy and personal safety and the same kinds of protections that now, under this act, will be available to other workers in Ontario: to be protected from being asked by their employer to disclose their past compensation.", "In the time that I have left, I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the other concerns I have heard that are perhaps not specific to this bill but more general in nature.", "We heard from the Minister of Labour and the minister responsible for women’s issues about all of these different initiatives that this government has undertaken. What I have heard when I have talked to women across this province is that this government is not connecting the dots. We have a women’s empowerment strategy—this is the centrepiece of that strategy—that doesn’t mention violence against women, no mention of violence against women. We know that it is lack of economic opportunity in their workplaces that makes women vulnerable to becoming victims of violence.", "Shortly before the women’s empowerment strategy, we saw this government announce a new Gender-Based Violence Strategy. That strategy doesn’t even mention sexual harassment at work. This is a time when the #MeToo movement is creating unprecedented demand for supports for women who have been sexually harassed at work, and when sexual harassment has been identified as a key barrier to women achieving empowerment.", "We see a government that is taking credit for providing paid leave for survivors of domestic violence and sexual violence but, frankly, had to be pushed, resisting every step of the way, into including that amendment in Bill 148.", "I’m proud of the work that the NDP caucus did in this Legislature to put paid leave for domestic violence and sexual violence on the public agenda, to work with a coalition of advocates and labour leaders to try to push this government to include it in Bill 148, because if they had their way—we saw from first reading of Bill 148 that they had no intention of providing paid leave for domestic violence and sexual violence—no intention whatsoever. We saw that in the first reading of Bill 148, and we saw it in the second reading of Bill 148, after they had heard widespread input throughout the public input process on the first reading of Bill 148, when people were coming and telling this Liberal government that they needed to pass Peggy Sattler’s bill on paid leave for domestic violence and sexual violence. Yet what did they do? They came back with unpaid leave for domestic violence and sexual violence, causing all of these advocates to have to come together one more time to finally get this government to agree to make that important change.", "This is also the same government that, during the debate on Bill 148, refused to lift the server exemption from minimum wage requirements. There is extensive research to show that lower minimum wages have been shown to make servers more vulnerable to sexual violence and harassment.", "I just wanted to talk a little bit about the research on servers, and the actions that are being implemented in other jurisdictions to acknowledge the risks that we are putting women, largely, who work as servers in the hospitality industry—the risks that we are exposing them to when we continue to allow a lower minimum wage.", "There was a study published just last May that found that sexual harassment in the workplace “increases financial stress, largely by precipitating job change, and can significantly alter women’s career attainment.” The study found that women who reported having been sexually harassed at work were 6.5 times more likely to change jobs, compared to women who had not been harassed. Often when they changed jobs, when they moved employment, it wasn’t into a job with a higher salary or more growth potential.", "That confirms what I had been saying earlier about sexual harassment as a real barrier to enabling women to achieve empowerment, and also to help close the gender wage gap.", "With regard to the liquor server exemption from minimum wage requirements, there is great research that has been done in BC that confirms that the liquor server wage exemption, which they also have in BC, has a very negative impact on women, who make up the majority of liquor servers in that province and in this province. It makes women more vulnerable to sexual harassment and sexualization of the workplace. If they don’t play nice, they won’t get paid; they won’t get tipped.", "This research points out that this is unfair to the public. It shifts the burden of compensating these employees onto customers because of the expectation that they will tip. It also effectively represents a wage subsidy for restaurant and bar owners and may incentivize employers, specifically restaurants, to start serving alcohol so that they can pay their employees at lower pay rates.", "Women who work as servers and who do resist the harassment that they experience from customers risk losing a tip. Without minimum wage requirements that apply to all workers, effectively within licensed establishments we are normalizing sexualized behaviour and conveying to the people who work there, the women who work there, that this is just something they have to put up with if they want to earn a living.", "We also know that there are a number of US jurisdictions that are taking action to level the playing field to recognize the vulnerability that we are creating for liquor servers when we allow a lower minimum wage. In New York, there are going to be public hearings on this issue. There’s a ballot question that is in place in Washington, D.C. They’re looking at getting this issue on the statewide ballot in Michigan. Seven US states—Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin—mandate that tipped workers be paid as least the same minimum wage as everyone else.", "This government had the chance to equalize the minimum wage for liquor servers and chose not to. They did not agree to amend the legislation, to support the amendment that was brought forward by the NDP caucus to remove those exemptions from the minimum wage requirements of Bill 148.", "This is also the same government that has refused to move forward on another one of my private member’s bills that would make sexual violence and harassment training mandatory within Smart Serve certification, which would also go a long way to making workplaces safer for women in Ontario.", "Speaker, I want to close with a return to the Equal Pay Coalition. I have to congratulate the organizations and the legal scholars who are part of the Equal Pay Coalition, who have worked for years to push the government to take action. They talk about the need for 12 steps that would really constitute a comprehensive strategy and an effective strategy to close the gender wage gap. They have called repeatedly on this government to take those 12 steps.", "Step 1 is to treat closing the gap as a human rights priority. I talked about that earlier today. We have to recognize that women’s rights to equal pay and employment opportunities are not something that we’re going to do out of the goodness of our heart. Those are fundamental human rights that all women are entitled to achieve.", "Step 2 is to raise awareness through annual Equal Pay Days and education. Certainly I appreciate that this government has moved forward with Equal Pay Days. I am concerned about the fact that we’re marking Equal Pay Day in April, but at least we are calling attention to the size of the gap.", "They’ve called for the development of a closing-the-gender-pay-gap plan by 2025.", "They’ve called for pay transparency laws that are comparable to existing pay equity laws.", "They’ve called for employment equity laws and policy.", "They’ve called for increased access to collective bargaining, another step that would make an enormous difference for women.", "They’ve called for increasing the minimum wage—something that we had been calling for, long before the Liberals—and affordable and accessible child care.", "They’ve called for mainstreaming equity compliance into government laws and policy; in other words, taking an intersectional gender lens to everything that this government does." ],

There’s a balance with regulation. Regulation is very helpful to be able to specifically identify those areas and get to those places where you want to get to. It also enables you to enhance legislation later on or adjust for something—an unintended consequence. So that balance between regulation and legislation, I think, is critical, and I think there is a balance there. I understand, when you look at that, you can say that there’s some risk in doing that, but I think that risk is worthwhile because it enables you to be able to adjust in a way that’s more effective and efficient later on through the regulation posting process.", "Of course, this legislation will require all public job postings to include salary ranges and will bar employers from asking applicants about their compensation. It would also eventually require certain employers to record, report and post compensation data that includes gender and other diversity characteristics.", "I heard the member discussing the minimum wage and the server’s wage. Our oldest daughter was a server. One day, she was serving and somebody said something to her that was very inappropriate. She basically said, “That’s not appropriate.” She ended up getting fired—this is about 10 years ago. I know what you’re saying about the minimum wage, that gap that’s there. I’m not sure that that created that problem. I think that the problem that exists is the way that we treat each other and how we view our behaviour just between each other.", "Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I know the polling is showing that 81% of voters want anybody else but this government. So all of a sudden, we’re looking at fairer pay. We’re forgetting about how poorly run the province is. People are not going to forget that. We’re looking at the manufacturing industry gone. Leland Industries is leaving and saying that the reason they’re leaving is because they can no longer afford to operate a business in this province.", "It’s a horrendous record they have. Sure, there’s a month left before we have an election, but you can’t just change the page like that and expect people to forget the horrendous job that this government has done. I think people in my riding are just—they would like to have the election tomorrow to put an end to this government, because it’s just painful to watch them go down and squirm.", "But I think we have to look at trying to curtail—I mean, this is certainly well-needed legislation, rushed through. There has been no briefing to our party. We haven’t seen the details. That’s just the way they’re running it. Everything is at the last minute here.

Nonetheless, again let’s just say that she’s done some work on it.", "The suggestion has been—they kind of danced around the process of how this bill came together. The province began this process four years ago. In the course of doing the essential groundwork, the working group brought together representatives from equality advocacy groups, labour organizations, human resource professionals and businesses. They called the body the gender wage gap steering committee. They held extensive province-wide public consultations and developed a report that provided the government a range of options to consider. I was wondering, and I asked, in the course of the four years of doing that consultation, was the NDP involved in that? Did they make any presentations? No—just to put a little bit of perspective on it.", "Now, in this case, Ontario took some immediate steps on a number of the steering committee’s recommendations, and in the course of the last 12 months brought together another similar group to further discuss the report and to provide practical input on some of these specific initiatives and interests.

It has not, all of a sudden, been discovered by this Liberal government. It has been in existence for decades and decades. It has not been closed for almost 30 years, since the Pay Equity Act was first introduced. This Liberal government has been in a position to do something to address the gender wage gap. For 15 years they have occupied those seats on the benches across the way, and yet they have chosen to do nothing until they’re in their dying days of their final mandate.

Currently, private and public employers in the United Kingdom with 250 or more employees must report their gender pay gap statistics. In Australia—down under—employers with more than 100 employees must provide gender wage statistics and answer questions on other workplace equality indicators.

I have to say that having been involved with a group that sometimes would give women positions just because they were women—I do not agree with that, I can tell you right now. I believe that you have to have good candidates, whether they’re male or female, but I do believe there are lots of very highly qualified and capable women candidates to be on these boards.", "Our government is leading by example.

I have also reviewed a written submission from the NDP chief government whip, the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane, Mr. Vanthof, that is broadly supportive of Mr. Hillier’s submission. I am now prepared to rule on this matter without hearing further from the member, as the standing order 21(d) permits me to do so.", "The member states that the government has indicated that it intends to bring forward certain amendments to the bill when the bill is eventually at that stage in committee. The member alleges that the anticipated amendments are of such a nature and of such significance that he is unable to meaningfully participate in the current debate since the current version of the bill is incomplete as a result. The member therefore says he is unable to fulfill his duties and functions as a member, which is a breach of privilege.", "I will note that when this bill was last debated, the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington raised a point of order to challenge the orderliness of Bill 2 on substantially the same grounds as are raised in his point of privilege.

It is difficult to reconcile the member’s plea that he has been prevented from participating in the debate when quite the opposite is the actual case.", "I understand the nuance of the member’s argument with respect to the fact that certain possible amendments to the bill were not available for him to substantively address during his speech, but that fact did not prevent the member from being able to stand in the House and participate in debate.", "Further, the possibility that amendments to a bill will be put forward in a committee exists with any bill; there is nothing about the legislative process on Bill 2 that is different from any other public bill. I will finally say that the member’s fear that he will be deprived of meaningful participation on Bill 2 ought to be tempered by the realization that he—and all members—are protected from arbitrarily having amendments sprung on them that are beyond the scope of the bill as it was agreed to in principle at second reading. Admissible amendments must fall within the umbrella of the bill as agreed to, to that point.", "For the various reasons I just mentioned, I cannot find that the member has made out a point of a prima facie case of privilege.", "Therefore, it is time for question period." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, for recognizing me to speak on this very important bill, Bill 13, the Ontario Rebate for Electricity Consumers Act.", "As the members would know, this bill is very comprehensive in nature, in providing some very important relief for Ontario consumers of electricity. It’s a bill that really covers the entire breadth and scope of our province and the needs of Ontarians in their everyday lives.", "This bill, if passed, really would put a three-part plan in place. One, it will rebate Ontario’s portion of HST for families and small businesses, a savings of 8% or $130 annually for the average household. Essentially, Madam Speaker, it is a tax cut. What the bill provides for is to cut the 8% provincial HST tax off electricity hydro rates. So that’s what it is in essence. Consumers, right on their bill, no longer will pay—if this bill is passed—the 8% portion of HST on all electricity use. That is a very significant tax cut—a cut in HST—that is provided for in this legislation.", "The second thing it does is it increases protection for rural and remote customers of electricity, resulting in a net benefit for these households of 20%, or $540 on average. So we are looking at those consumers in rural or remote areas who live in low-density areas. We recognize that these are places where there are not a lot of people living, that there are fewer people living in this area and that they’re far away from where the majority of the people in this province live.", "Of course, Speaker, it is costly to supply electricity in those areas. You don’t need to understand all the ins and outs of economics in the electricity sector to understand that if you’re going to provide a product at a far distance, it is going to cost more money. Therefore, we know that the distribution charge in those areas tends to be significantly higher because they are further from where most Ontarians live and they are low density. In other words, there are fewer people who live there so it costs more to provide electricity in those areas. We are taking an additional step in reducing the distribution cost for those consumers to provide for them a savings of 20% from their bills, which will be roughly about $540 per year on average, a very significant plan in terms of providing savings for rural and remote customers.", "The third thing this bill does is provide supports for our large and medium-sized businesses. The first part of the plan that I outlined, which was cutting the provincial HST from all hydro bills, would apply to all residential customers and small businesses as well. This third part of the plan deals with large and medium-sized businesses. What it does is it expands the industrial conservation initiative, making it possible for newly eligible medium and large businesses to achieve savings of as much as one third of their bill.", "This program has been in existence for large businesses for some time. Basically what it does is it incentivizes those businesses to move their production or move their use of electricity to low peak times. That has two very important results. One, not only does it reduce the cost for the manufacturer to use electricity when it’s cheapest to use, but also, most importantly, it takes a load off the entire electricity grid. What it does is it allows for fewer people, fewer businesses, large businesses, using electricity at peak times when it is most costly to produce electricity—to a period which is at a low peak time or a low time when it’s cheaper to produce electricity. So it’s a win-win: a win for businesses to be able to use cheaper electricity, but also a win for the entire system and therefore a win for all users because all of a sudden, you don’t have to produce electricity when it’s the most expensive time to produce electricity.", "What we are doing through this program is we’re expanding the criteria for the program for other large businesses and for medium businesses as well. Our hope is—and I think there’s a good indication that we have support from business groups like the Ontario Chamber of Commerce—that that is going to create more opportunity for large and medium-sized businesses to participate in this program, again saving money for themselves, but also saving money for the entire electricity system. That results in lower hydro rates for consumers as well. This is a very comprehensive plan that has been put forward by the government, again, really thinking through all different aspects of the users in the system.", "Now, it’s interesting that I really don’t hear a lot of opposition to this plan from the opposition parties. They may try to spin it every which way. This is exactly the kind of thing they were trying to promote. It will be very interesting to see them vote against this bill and tell Ontarians that they really don’t believe they should get a break. But I recall that this is exactly the kind of thing they were hoping the government would do, and now the government is doing it. Of course, you hear all kinds of spin or rhetoric from the opposition parties, but that’s the nature of the game and I guess we all understand. Ontarians will see through it.", "Madam Speaker, I really wanted to take some time, in the time that’s allotted to me, to have another very important conversation, because I think when it comes to talking about electricity, the cost of electricity, what it takes to produce electricity and what kind of electricity you produce, for all those things you see very simplistic rhetoric coming from all sides, from all directions.

This is the kind of conversation that I have with my constituents all the time when I am out every week knocking on doors in my community. It’s a healthy conversation to have.", "Now, I’ve taken some time to learn a little bit more about our electricity system: how it operates, what the challenges are within the system, where the opportunities are and what the government has done over the last 10 or so years to improve our electricity system. One of the things that I’ve learned, first of all, is that the economics around our electricity system are very similar to the economics around the health care system. It’s complex, it’s unique, and one has to be able to understand it fully.", "Madam Speaker, I’m very sorry. I am remiss that I did not tell you that I will be sharing my time with the members for Barrie and Northumberland–Quinte West and the President of the Treasury Board. I just got that in—so thank you very much for the helpful note that came my way to tell you. I was just so into the things I wanted to talk about; now there’s pressure on me to leave some time for three other members who will be speaking after me.", "As I was saying, Madam Speaker, it’s important to understand—I think it’s incumbent on all members to make sure that our constituents understand how the electricity system works, because it is a complex system. It’s a system that you can’t really put out in a 30-second sound bite or a 140-character tweet. I think it’s just like trying to explain to somebody how our health care system works—and Madam Speaker, you are a nurse by profession, so you very much know how the health care system works. It’s a complex system. It has a lot of design aspects to it, and it’s important to understand the entire breadth and scope of it.", "When I’m asked the question by my constituents as to why we have seen increases in the price of hydro, which is a legitimate question to ask—" ],

We got rid of it. We are the first jurisdiction in North America which does not, anymore, burn dirty coal to produce electricity. That is incredible. That is amazing. This is what President Obama is now saying the United States should be going to, and other jurisdictions are looking forward to it. So in fact, Ontario has been a leader when it comes to eliminating the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the province—in fact, in the country.", "To the point, Madam Speaker: You may remember that former Prime Minister Harper was even trying to take credit for that action that was taken by the Ontario Liberal government. It was out of nowhere. It was kind of amusing to watch, how he was trying to take credit: “Oh, Canada has done great stuff, because we eliminated coal.” Well, no, Mr. Prime Minister. It’s not the federal government. The Ontario government has taken that very important and difficult decision of taking coal—dirty coal—out of our system and no longer relying on that to produce electricity. That was a huge source of emissions, and it caused serious problems.", "The other thing we have done, Madam Speaker—time is limited for me—is that we have invested a significant amount of money in making our system reliable. We are talking about $30 billion invested in new and refurbished generation since 2003 and over $13 billion of improvements in the Hydro One system, including upgrades to over 11,000 kilometres of power lines.", "All of this is to say that this has a cost to the system, and that’s where we have seen increases within our system, because all that investment has resulted in making sure that not only do we have a clean electricity system, we have a reliable and secure electricity system. But we are at a point now that we have done those investments. We are starting to see that the costs that were increasing are plateauing.", "We are also making sure that there is relief provided to hydro customers.

Let me repeat that: The independent Financial Accountability Officer said that the claims about our energy policy—confirmed that the average family in Ontario spends less money on electricity than in every other province except British Columbia. It also confirmed that total home heating and cooling costs are in the middle of the pack when compared to other provinces.", "Ontario’s electricity prices are in line with comparative jurisdictions.

Ontario will benefit from our leadership.", "That said, we know that the investments we have made to modernize and clean up our electricity supply have put cost pressures on some families.

We will be given back the provincial sales tax that we pay on our hydro bills, which we didn’t pay until it was put on some years ago by this government. So we get it back—8%.", "Additionally, we’re going to get another 20% if we happen to be in rural Ontario. That’s wonderful. We appreciate that. Now, we have to look at a couple of things. Rural Ontario is paying more than urban Ontario, to start with. Basically, what you’re giving us back is money that we never should have paid in the first place. Also, electricity costs in the last 12 years that this government has been in power have gone up 400%. That’s about 28% a year. We get a gift for a year, and at the end of one year, the gift runs out, and then we go back to increasing rates of hydro.", "The bill also doesn’t talk about where the billion-dollar cost comes from—because when you give us money, it has to come from somewhere. Where does it come from? Well, there’s only one public purse, and there’s only one taxpayer. So the guy who pays the hydro bill who’s getting 28% is going to pay the 28% somewhere else, whether it’s another tax, more debt or something of that nature.", "Wind and solar power don’t work because they require big subsidies.

When they tried to tell this to the ordinary folks at the plowing match, guess what happened? They all got booed, and booed severely. The general public does not believe this bafflegab that they’re trying to press on the people of Ontario. It was incredible, the amount of people in that audience that didn’t and won’t believe what this government is trying to shove down their throats.", "It’s interesting that they will talk about this 8% reduction in their bills to ratepayers in Ontario, and they’ll show that very proudly on the hydro bills, but they won’t do that with the cap-and-trade system. They’re going to hide that. They will not put that as a second line item because they don’t want people to know what it’s costing them for cap-and-trade.", "I had a cottage owner come to me a while ago. He showed me his hydro bill. A lot of people; a lot of the MPPs in this Legislature have got these bills. He shut his power off all winter—shut it off. He used zero power.

I said, “Delivery of nothing.”", "You know, it would be pretty easy to make a living in the sales business if you were selling stuff and you could get $100 from somebody and not have to deliver it. That’s a pretty good deal. That’s what this government is trying to shove down the throats of Ontarians, and they’re just not believing it." ],

No other province has a delivery rate. No other province has a line loss charge, but Ontario does. So when they talk about their competitive electricity rates, we can all see that it is, at best, an unctuous argument that is not being fully disclosed and revealed to people.", "Speaker, why we’ve seen this 36-cent solution offered is the result of a small event in Scarborough–Rouge River.

He came up to me. He said, “Peggy, what can you do about the Liberals’ bait-and-switch with our hydro bills?” This is someone who works as a credit counsellor with many low-income people in my riding. He deals on a daily basis with people who are behind on their hydro bills, who are struggling to make ends meet, who are daily confronted by this heat-or-eat choice that so many Ontarians have to make and that we’ve heard so much about. That really is a crisis in this province, despite the Minister of Energy’s refusal to acknowledge it as such.", "This constituent told me about the growing number of clients who are bringing in their hydro bills to show him, to get some guidance, some advice, some assistance on what they can do to manage their income and their expenses. They end up going straight from his office to the food bank because they can’t afford to buy groceries after they have paid their hydro bills. This is a person who deals with a number of individuals who live in social housing. They are on Ontario Works or on ODSP.", "In my community—and, I’m sure, in many communities across this province—many of these social housing developments are aging. They were built several decades ago. Many of them are heated with electric baseboard heaters. People who live in these units have very, very limited ability to reduce their usage. They can’t afford retrofits; they have no capacity to bring in new conservation measures. They are at the mercy of these hydro bills because of their electric heating.", "This weekend I also met with the local coordinator of London’s Keep Hydro Public campaign. This, as many members know, is a non-partisan campaign focused on halting the privatization of Hydro One. This local coordinator told me that the Keep Hydro Public lawn signs we have seen popping up across the province—they’re flying off the shelves in London. There are more requests than they can possibly keep up with. They’ve got dozens of calls coming in on a daily basis. When they’ve been out canvassing door-to-door asking if people want these lawn signs, she told me that at least 90% of the people that they talk to say, “Yes, put up a sign.” For the ones who don’t want a sign, it’s because of landscaping or something else. They’ve even got a car screeching to a halt on the street saying, “Can you please deliver one of those signs? I want to put one of those signs on my lawn.”", "We had Western Fair in my community a couple of weeks ago. Keep Hydro Public had a booth at Western Fair. They collected over 700 signatures in just a few days. Every single person who stopped by the booth wanted to sign the petition. She mentioned that this was a bit of a change from last year. Last year, people were asking questions about asking what this was about. This year everybody knows what it’s about, and they want to do something to try to stop the privatization of Hydro One.", "The Keep Hydro Public campaign also had a booth at AMO in August. Many members attended that conference. She told me that there was huge support from mayors and from counsellors across the province who stopped by the Keep Hydro Public booth and expressed their support for that initiative.", "I was talking to a city of London councillor recently who told me the same thing. She said that she went to AMO. Everybody she talked to at AMO was raising concerns about hydro privatization and how the sell-off will affect hydro rates and how it will affect the ability of municipalities to do local economic development. The cost of hydro, as we know from the chamber of commerce, is a huge barrier to business growth and development, and it has a real impact on the health of local economies.", "The third conversation I had this weekend was with a senior. This is a retiree who lives on a fixed income and who had taken a much-anticipated trip to Scotland over the summer. He was away for four weeks on vacation, came back and opened up a hydro bill that was the highest bill he had ever received in all of his years living in London. He had used no air conditioning. He had never once opened or closed the fridge. He had never once turned the lights on or off. He had not been watching TV. He had not been using the computer. Basically the only electricity that was used was what was needed to keep his appliances plugged in.", "Speaker, I’m sharing these conversations because they shed real light on the complete inadequacy of the solution to out-of-control hydro rates that is before us today in this bill. This is a bill that was introduced as part of the Liberal government’s elaborate attempt to change the channel, to better position themselves for the next election and to look after their own interests rather than the interests of the people of Ontario. It was one of the first pieces of legislation introduced following the prorogation of the Legislature in September. It was part of the “great reset” that started with the new speech from the throne, which had as its centrepiece the bill which we are debating today.", "This bill promises to rebate the provincial portion of the HST on hydro bills in Ontario to respond to Ontarians’ concerns about rising prices. I do want to say that New Democrats have no problem with removing the provincial portion of the HST from hydro bills. In fact, we have been calling for that for at least six years, since the HST was first applied to hydro, because at the time we argued that hydro should be exempt from the HST. The 8% that the Liberals are so generously proposing to remove should never have been added in the first place.", "Electricity is an essential service. It should be exempt from sales tax, just like all other essentials. All Ontarians, regardless of where they live in this province, rely on electricity to heat and light their homes, to run their refrigerators to store their food safely, to cook and to clean. They need hydro for basic communications. We know that there are Ontarians with medical needs—for example, dialysis machines—who need hydro to run those machines that keep them alive. The list goes on and on.", "An exemption should have been made for hydro to be removed from the HST at the very beginning—which, of course, is what we were pushing for at the time—but the Liberals, in their wisdom, refused to exempt electricity from the sales tax. With this bill, they are still refusing to exempt electricity, and are instead offering an 8% rebate.", "Some may ask: “What’s the difference between a rebate and an exemption if the bottom line to consumers is the same?” The big difference is that a rebate can be eliminated at any time. We know this because of our experience with the Ontario Clean Energy Benefit, which was a 10% reduction in hydro bills that was in place from 2011 to 2015, which was then removed.", "It’s interesting that when this 8% rebate was first announced, the finance minister refused at the time to say whether and when it would end. We’ve since heard the Premier say that it will remain in place, but it’s impossible for us to know whether this is just a strategy to help the Liberals through the next election or if it really is a commitment from the government.", "We have experiences that would suggest that it might just be a strategy. We saw this when the gas plants were cancelled, which in many ways led to my election in the by-election in 2013. This was a $1-billion seat-saver strategy to help the Liberals win GTA ridings in the 2011 provincial election. The clean energy benefit was a two-election strategy that helped the Liberals out in 2011 and then again in 2014. This seems to be the modus operandi of this Liberal government: They use taxpayer dollars to shore up support in advance of an election and hope that people don’t see through the strategy.", "The other big difference between a rebate and an exemption is that people can see a rebate on their bills, compliments of the government of Ontario, just like they saw the 10% clean energy benefit that was previously in place.", "This time, however, I’m not sure how appreciative the people of Ontario are going to be. Instead of the 10% reduction that was in place until 2015, there will now be an 8% reduction. Instead of simply exempting hydro from the provincial portion of the HST, a cumbersome bureaucratic process is going to be required to rebate the amount of tax paid so that hydro customers can know how generous this Liberal government is.", "The government has claimed that the reason they’re taking this approach is that an exemption would take too long and that it would require complicated negotiations with the federal government, but there is no reason why this 8% reduction couldn’t be implemented as a rebate initially until the permanent exemption is in place. One has to think that the federal Liberals would be very willing to help fast-track the negotiations that would be required, given the help that they received from the Premier in the last election.", "I also find it ironic that at the same time the Liberals are touting the transparency of the rebate on their electricity bills, they have no problem whatsoever with the OEB burying cap-and-trade revenues in the delivery charges on people’s gas bills. But for my constituents in London West, the most insulting thing about the rebates that we are talking about today is that the only reason we’re debating this bill is because the Liberals lost a by-election in Scarborough–Rouge River.", "People in my riding, people in southwestern Ontario, and people in many regions of this province often feel that policy decisions that are made by this government do not take into account regional perspectives. They are made with a GTA lens that doesn’t reflect the needs of other areas of the province. The fact that the results of this by-election in Scarborough–Rouge River triggered an “aha” moment for this Liberal government is astonishing to my constituents. We have been raising concerns about this issue since long before I was elected in 2013, and in fact it has become increasingly urgent since that time.", "I want to read to you some of the emails I’ve been receiving on this issue. This is from two years ago: “I am writing today in regard to the increasing hydro rates and the recent rate hike. As a single person living alone, it has become increasingly harder to pay the monthly expenses and having a hydro bill that has doubled in the past five years hasn’t helped.”", "Here’s one from more than a year and a half ago: “I am absolutely outraged at the insane hydro rates I am paying. I live in a small house in Oakridge. Last month my hydro bill was $497. This month it is $512. This is destroying me financially.”", "Or here’s one from April, 2015, more than a year and a half ago: “I feel like I can’t breathe. I’m disabled and live on a fixed income. I struggle to pay my bills. Hydro is going up again in May. I’m overwhelmed. I’m scared that I can’t afford to live in my apartment anymore because hydro is so high already. What do I do? Why is this happening? Please, is there something you can do to help” me “and others like me? Does Wynne even care about us and the working poor?”", "Or here’s another one, almost a year ago: “I am concerned with the ever-increasing costs of hydro. I am middle-class. I live in a single-family house and my hydro bill is ever increasing. It has increased $150 to $200 a month in the last five years with little to no increase in consumption.”", "So, Speaker, that this is suddenly news to this Liberal government, as I said before, is shocking to me and my constituents in London West. In August, like everybody else in this House, we learned from the Ontario Energy Board that there are 12,400 Londoners who were behind on their hydro bills in 2015, an increase of over 1,000 families since 2013. London Hydro had to write off $692,000 in 2015 because they have given up trying to collect those monies owed. People simply don’t have the resources to pay their bills. And I know we’ve all dealt with casework from constituents whose hydro has been cut off because they simply can’t afford to pay.", "As we know, Ontario has the highest average electricity rates not just in Canada but across North America, with some minor exceptions. But basically, Ontario is leading the way. This has made energy poverty a very real and frightening prospect for people who live in my community of London West and also for people across the province.", "We read stories in the media on a regular basis. There was a family in Moosonee who said they had cut down on entertainment and groceries, reduced buying fruits and vegetables, unplugged all of their appliances and used the BBQ for cooking. The only reason they were able to light their house is because their adult son was paying them rent. Yet these people, despite all of these measures they had taken, were unable to afford their hydro bills.", "Speaker, vulnerable households in this province are those who pay about 30% of their income on energy. We know that many of these are renters, who make up 28% of Ontario households overall but almost half of all energy-vulnerable households. What this government is proposing to do with this 8% rebate is a drop in the bucket for these energy-vulnerable consumers across this province.", "In the very few minutes I have left I wanted to reiterate some of the points that were made by my colleague the member for Toronto–Danforth when he made his lead-off speech in the House. He talked about the reason that this bill is so inadequate: It does not address the three big factors that have contributed to skyrocketing hydro rates in this province. Those are privatization, which he estimates has added about $750 million to $1 billion a year to people’s hydro bills; the second factor is the oversupply of power, which the IESO says has contributed to about a 30% increase in electricity costs over the last decade; the third is the drop in demand which, again, the IESO says has contributed to about a 40% increase in people’s hydro bills over the last decade.", "These are the real factors that have led to the crisis that we have before us in this province today. Yet there is nothing in this bill to address these factors.", "In London, we have a historic and very proud relationship with Adam Beck, the father of the electricity system in this province and a former mayor of London, highly revered in my community and across this province.", "One of the quotes that I’d like to share from Adam Beck has real relevance for what we’re talking about today. He said: “It is the duty of the government to see that development is not hindered by permitting a handful of people to enrich themselves out of these treasures”—meaning hydroelectricity generation—“at the expense of the general public.” That is what Sir Adam Beck told us so many years ago, and it remains true today.", "Instead of this government fulfilling its duty, which Adam Beck had pointed out, preventing the further privatization of our electricity system that was begun by the PCs and has been entrenched by the Liberals—instead of taking those meaningful actions that would really do something about rising hydro rates, like halting the privatization of Hydro One, we see this drop in the bucket with the bill before us today." ],

I don’t think anybody would argue that those changes needed to take place. We took a very dirty system and made it clean by eliminating coal-fired generation. That was another crucial thing that I believe the opposition supported.", "The actions that we’re taking under Bill 13, the Ontario Rebate for Electricity Consumers Act, are important as well. Rebating Ontario’s portion of the HST for families and small business is a savings of 8%—$130 annually for the average household. That’s being done through legislation. That’s still significant and important.", "Increasing protection for rural and remote customers for those people who are eligible, particularly those in low-density areas: This is really important and will result in a benefit for those households of up to 20% of the total cost, or $540 on average.", "One of the pieces that I think hasn’t been probably spoken about nearly enough is expanding the Industrial conservation initiative by lowering the level at which they qualify in making medium, small and large businesses eligible for savings of as much as 33% or 34% of their bill. That’s really significant as well.", "I’m sure you don’t mean to minimize the impact of these changes and the actions that are taken.

He talked about the spin and he talked about rhetoric. I want to suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that the facts I’m going to bring are actually from the Auditor General’s annual report of 2015. The Auditor General at that point suggested that our gas plants cost us $1.2 billion for energy that we didn’t get. He talked about global adjustments from 2006 to 2014 being $37 billion. From 2015 to 2032, an additional $133 billion will be spent on global adjustments. Those numbers are of a magnitude that most people can’t even comprehend how much money that is, but that’s taking away from our hospitals, it’s taking away from our school system and it’s taking from the most vulnerable people who need all of our social services in our communities.", "Renewables: We’ve overpaid, by his facts, $9.2 billion on these contracts for energy that we do not need. They want to continue to talk about all of this—they inherited a system that was unreliable. Again, according to the Auditor General, outages are 30% longer since they’ve taken power. From 2012 to 2015, they happened 24% more often. He states that they’re the least reliable of all the large Canadian distributors from 2010 to 2014, and there has been an increase of 275% in outages from 2012 to 2015. Sixty thousand people in our province have no power in spite of all these programs that they purport and use as their speaking notes to say that Ontarians have access.", "Mr. Speaker, let’s not treat the taxpayers of Ontario as fools. It is their money they’re recycling back into them to try to win favour. That’s $1 billion that’s not going to be there for our hospitals, our schools and our less fortunate people across our province.", "I think the member from London West said it well: People are seeing through this.

I think that as I start, it’s important for me to underline and underscore exactly what it is that we’re announcing and debating. I understand that the opposition parties will continue to do their best to minimize exactly what this announcement represents for all Ontarians, and even more for some Ontarians. I’m going to get to that, I think, right off the top.", "Number one, I want people to know that we will be removing on January 1, 2017—assuming the legislation is able to be passed—8%, or the PST portion of the HST, off of everybody’s electricity bills in the province of Ontario. I understand the effort to minimize this, but that represents approximately on average $130 for everyone in the province of Ontario that is paying their hydro bill. That is not an insignificant amount.", "In fact, I would say, Speaker, before I go on to the second component of the announcement, that in the years in this chamber that we have been debating energy and energy pricing in the province of Ontario, I don’t think I have heard another idea come forward from the third party, the NDP. In fact, I think the NDP had this piece in their platform document. If not in 2011, then they did have it in 2014. If it wasn’t in the first election that I just referenced, it was certainly in the second, so at least once they have had this in a platform document. Yet somehow today they find themselves in the position of having to argue against a piece that they felt was important enough to contain in a platform document.", "So, number one, Speaker, that’s been done: Effective January 1, assuming the legislation passes—and hopefully it will pass—we’ll be in a position of removing $130 on average from everybody’s electricity bill.", "The second part of this is a piece that I think is important and worth noting: If you’re a Hydro One customer in the province of Ontario and you live in a low-density area—and you can find that right on your bill. If you find your Hydro One bill, on page 2, it will tell you if you’re in a low-density area. If you’re not seasonal or under any other restriction, most of those folks in Hydro One low density will receive an additional 12% off of their bill, in addition to the 8% from the PST portion of the HST. The total of 20%, as explained to me, will average out to approximately $540 every year for people in the province of Ontario. That is not an insignificant amount of money.", "As I said a couple of times already, I understand it’s the role of the opposition to argue and critique these particular policy pieces. But I would say this goes farther than anything I’ve heard either party over the last two or three years represent or suggest they might implement, should they have had the opportunity. So this is a very, very significant move on our part: $540.", "What’s important to also mention is that I know that the Minister of Energy, when he brought this forward—I believe he asked for unanimous consent. What that would mean, to people who are following this on television, is that had unanimous consent been granted, that would have ensured our ability to move this forward by January 1, 2017. But, for some reason, the opposition parties—I’m not sure if one or both—did not agree to unanimous consent on this legislation. And so, now our work will continue to ensure we are able to move forward with this policy, should the legislation pass by January 1, 2017.", "Speaker, another part—and I do want to thank former Minister Chiarelli, as well as current Minister Thibeault, for this piece—is the low-density piece. The rural part of the ridings is a part that I have been very focused on over the last number of months and have advocated on. I want to thank both of them for their work on the file.", "The other thing I would like to reference before getting into some other remarks is that there has been a suggestion made that the only reason we are moving forward on this file is because of the results of the recent election in Scarborough—I forget the particular name of the riding." ],

I know that this has not yet, as far as I’m aware, been part of the conversation to this point.", "I had an event on this in my riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan just this past Saturday in Kakabeka Falls at the Legion. Kakabeka Falls is in the city of Oliver Paipoonge, which is in my riding. We had a pretty nice turnout. I spoke to them about some of the cost drivers in the electricity price in the province of Ontario today. When I went through my remarks, I simply said, “As you are seized with this issue and as opposition members continue to talk about it, ask them how they may have avoided some of the cost increase, if not all of the cost increase, that has occurred since we came into government in 2003.”", "One of the pieces that I reminded them about—one gentleman and I had a fun little conversation: He said, “Well, you guys wanted to get rid of coal.” I said, “Yes, we did, but all three parties—the Conservatives, when Ernie Eves was the leader, and the NDP, when Howard Hampton was the leader in 2003—all of them agreed in the 2003 election that they would close coal as well.” So I said to the people who were at my meeting in Kakabeka Falls that, if they were going to fulfill their campaign promise in 2003, should they have won the election, either they had to make the commitment and close coal or they would have just ignored the commitment in their platform. The point of course was, let’s work on the assumption that they were going to close coal.", "Coal, in 2003, was about 5,000 or 6,000 megawatts of energy in the province of Ontario. It was about 20% or 25% of the total generated capacity of energy in the province of Ontario. So if you were going to close it, which both parties—not just the Liberals; the NDP, under Howard Hampton, and the Conservatives, under Ernie Eves, made the same commitment. So if you were going to close coal, 20% of our generated capacity, how were you going to replace that energy? Of course, the answer is that, no matter how you would have replaced it, it would have cost a lot of money to replace 20% of the total generated energy capacity in the province of Ontario. So I say to my friends in the riding—and I say this to them all the time. If they want to be critical of the price, you have to ask them how they would have done that and how much it would have cost. That’s point 1, Speaker.", "Point 2, which I like to remind them about as well, is that when we came into government in 2003, there was an artificial cap on the price of electricity. People, in their rate base on their bill, were not paying the true cost of the power. I think the Speaker will remember this; he was in government at the time. The cost on the bill—whatever it was showing up on your rate, the price per kilowatt hour—wasn’t the real cost of energy in the province of Ontario.", "I’m not sure why the party or the government of the day made a decision to put the cap in place; they may have felt it was the appropriate thing to do and supported in other ways. But the point I say to my friends in my riding and that I mentioned at my meeting in Kakabeka Falls the other day was that that also represented about 20% of the cost at the time, 15% or 20%; I forget what the amount was. That’s another significant driver in the cost because, if you remove the cap, you’re no longer paying it out of the tax pocket; now you’re paying it out of your rate pocket, which shows up on your bill.", "So we’ve got the coal piece, which represents 6,000 or 5,000 megawatts of energy; we’ve got a cap piece that has to be replaced. Somebody has to do it somehow.", "One of the other criticisms that we’ll hear often and that the opposition parties will use is about the Green Energy Act and the cost associated with bringing wind and solar on. Fair enough. That’s their position. I don’t know if it means that they support it or don’t support it. But when they talk about green energy, they only focus on the wind and solar. They don’t talk about—and somebody mentioned it in their remarks earlier. I can’t recall who it was—I apologize—but somebody talked about hydro and the need to bring more water power into the province of Ontario in terms of its total mix. Someone was referencing Sir Adam Beck and the mayor of London, so maybe it was the member from London.", "The truth is, we’ve done that; we’ve done it in a large way. But when people talk about green energy, they’re not talking about water power. They’re not talking about the fact that we’ve brought significant water power energy into the mix. They’re only talking about the wind and solar because that’s what they want to criticize.", "Beck III: We worked on that project for I don’t know how long, and when it was concluded, it cost about $1 billion. It represents about 1,000 additional megawatts of water power energy in the province of Ontario. So we have been doing that. One thousand megawatts: That’s a lot of juice. That project finished some time ago, I believe.", "Another one, in northeastern Ontario, if there is anybody—I see at least one member here who will be familiar with the Lower Mattagami project. Hundreds of tradespeople from Thunder Bay, in my riding—carpenters from the carpenters’ union, electricians, all sorts of workers were at that Lower Mattagami project for years. It was a long project. The Lower Mattagami project, Speaker, represents about 450 megawatts of water power energy in the province of Ontario. So with Beck and with the Lower Mattagami, you’re at 1,400 or 1,500 additional megawatts of water power energy. It’s not the only new water power that’s come on stream since we formed government, but there are two huge, huge water power projects.", "People want to just criticize the Green Energy Act. They want the people in the ridings to just hear about solar and wind, but they don’t talk about that piece at all. So we have brought on significant energy. They want to criticize the Green Energy Act and the cost drivers that it represents when it comes to the price on their hydro bill. Speaker, the truth of it is that the total procurement on the green energy side, including the water power that I have just described, does not represent a significant component of the price increase since we came to government in 2003. It simply does not.", "Others have spoken in the chamber already about the investments. They can talk about whether the system is more reliable today than it was in 2003. I don’t know anybody who has bona fides on this particular file who would say that it’s not more reliable today than it was in 2003. I believe, absolutely, most people would agree. Don’t talk to us about it; go outside and talk to the people that know. They will tell you that it’s a more reliable system than it was 10 and 13 years ago, and that, of course, comes with a cost. We have invested significantly.", "The investments in the infrastructure, the artificial cap, the coal replacement policy—I ask my friends, when they want to criticize it, what would you have done about those three component pieces of the electricity system in the province of Ontario? How would you have avoided those costs? They wouldn’t have. They wouldn’t have, Speaker, unless they were just going to leave the system to decay even further than it was when we came to government in 2003.", "I want to talk about delivery charges briefly. I hear the criticism of that from the opposition members as well. You will remember when that first started to show up in the hydro bill. It was in the late 1990s when the government of the day broke up what was then called Ontario Hydro into four or five different component pieces, different business units, if you will. One of them became Hydro One, another one was OPG, and there were two or three other business lines created through the breakup. It was at that point that for the first time—I believe for the first time—on your hydro bill, you saw the delivery charge broken out. It was always there, but for the first time it was broken out.", "People will see that, and they get frustrated by it. I argue to them, well, here’s the history; here’s why it is there now. But when you turn on the tap in your house and the water comes out of the tap, do you just pay for the water on your city water bill? I ask my friends in Thunder Bay: Do you just pay for the water that comes out of the tap, or do you pay for the pipes in the ground? Do you pay for the pumping station to get it through the pipes? Do you pay for the treatment plant—and our example in Thunder Bay, the Bare Point treatment centre, state-of-the-art, $50 million eight or 10 years ago, beautiful facility? The point is, it costs money. The pumping stations, the treatment plant, the pipes and everything that goes into delivering the water that comes out of your tap when you turn the tap on, you have to pay for it all.", "It’s the same with your energy system. We have to pay for the poles, we have to pay for the wires, we have to pay for everything that goes into the system as well as the generation, and it’s not a cheap system. It’s not a cheap system.", "So, Speaker, I remind people of that when they wonder about the delivery charge. That’s the history. That’s where it came from and that’s why it’s there. It’s part of the component costs of getting the energy to you on time, when you need it, and you can count on it.", "I want to talk a little bit—I’m down to about six or seven minutes here. I want to talk a little bit, if I can, just about municipal affordability and people that are even living in the unorganized parts of our province. Many of us came to government or ran for the first time—including me—in 2003, and we came here with some municipal council experience. I spent six years on Thunder Bay city council, from 1997 to 2003. No disrespect to the Speaker, but I remember the relationship that existed between the government of the day and municipal councils. I would say by and large, right across the province of Ontario, it was not a good relationship. I would say that one of the most egregious pieces of the damaging of the relationship between the government of the day and municipal councils was the downloading exercise that went on in a very significant way. Anybody who served on municipal councils during that time will know that.", "We stand here on this side of the aisle now and we listen to the criticisms that come from opposition parties—specifically, I would say, in this example, the official opposition—and they want to frame the context—they ran an election on this already and they’re going to run another one in 2018, I guess—for people in municipalities, ratepayers and taxpayers across the province of Ontario that, “Under this government, your life has become way more unaffordable”—that’s why they’re using the hydro example—“than it was when we were in government.”", "Speaker, I know this is easy for you; you were there for a long time, and some of your members as well. But, my goodness, the downloading exercise that went on in the late 1990s and the early 2000s—I can’t say this with absolute certainty but I’m going to say it with almost absolute certainty—might represent the biggest tax increase on a property taxpayer’s bill in the history of the province of Ontario. You can call it a tax increase, you can call it a tax shift or you can call it downloading, but small rural northern municipalities all across this province became responsible for miles of bridges. They became responsible for miles of roadway.", "I was in Kingston not that long ago, and my friend the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs was there. We both had an opportunity to speak at the conference. I believe—again, I’m going from memory here—that the Minister of Agriculture said that, in his area or in north or eastern Ontario—I can’t remember the geographic description that he used—something like 43% of the roads and bridges were downloaded to the municipalities in that area. They became responsible for the costs of maintaining those roads. They became responsible for all of the bridges as well as everything else that went on.", "So I tell people in my riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan and my constituents in Gillies and O’Connor and Conmee, in Oliver Paipoonge, in Neebing and Atikokan and Thunder Bay—I remind them of that and I say, “Just think about it for a second, because now through our uploading exercise through the OMPF and a variety of other programs, provincial assistance to municipalities has increased since 2003 to today by $2.7 billion.” That represents the uploaded costs on OW, social housing, land ambulance, public health units—all of that work that we have been doing to take those costs back off of the municipality taxpayer that were downloaded by the official opposition when they were in government. We’ve taken it—maybe not all of it, but a lot of it—back, and I can quantify $2.7 billion of it for you here today; an incredible amount.", "Here’s what I also tell them. I just emailed my constituency office a little while ago, I tell my friend across the way, trying to get the numbers on OCIF, the Ontario Community Infrastructure Fund. That’s not in that $2.7 billion that I just referenced, by the way. It’s not in there.", "Interjection." ],

Again, it’s 13 years of failed policy with respect to electricity.", "The other very worrisome concern—and this can only contribute, essentially, energy-generated policy and poverty—is the loss of business in the province of Ontario and the movement of investment out of the province even with a low Canadian dollar.", "It’s certainly something I see in my travels down in my rich riding of Haldimand–Norfolk.

Really, it’s all about appearing to do something rather than actually doing something to drill down on some of the core problems that have been created. Essentially, it’s an approach of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Peter is not happy about this. He is getting hit with a double whammy on his taxes and on his electricity bill.

So back then, under the Mike Harris-Ernie Eves government, people in Ontario were paying 4.3 cents a kilowatt hour for electricity.

Many people in my riding—and I have visited them—who do pay rent do have to pay for their electricity as well.", "I think the real kicker is that, for well over 100 years, electricity has served us very well in the province of Ontario. It’s a wonderful invention. I use it in spite of trying to heat with wood—sometimes I can’t meet the demand just with a couple of wood stoves. I use a fireplace in the fall and the spring, but that’s not effective in the deep of winter. The real problem here is that the wrong people have gained control of this precious resource. They have destroyed the economic advantage of what I consider a wonderful invention.", "People know this.

They have noted and explained to us a drop in electricity use, and certainly what I consider a startling decrease in the industrial use of electricity. But prices went up. As prices went up earlier this year, we were told it was because of the decreased demand. That really flies in the face of basic economic theory, where price is set by that tension between supply and demand. Normally, when the demand goes up, the price goes up. Normally, when there is excess supply, the price goes down. But in this case, we had a decrease in demand and the prices went up. That flies in the face of basic economics.", "Again, why is that? Well, we do know that government continues to sign very expensive contracts with wind and solar companies. We also know that over 90% of the successful bidders attended these high-priced Liberal fundraisers we heard so much about.", "Here again, there is good reason why so many people are afraid to open up their electricity bill. I really wonder if the members opposite, the cabinet and the Premier, are living in the same Ontario that the rest of us are.", "As we see these electricity bills climb to absurd levels, we hear more and more outlandish ideas around energy from this government, and they’re countered by experts, in spite of what we hear across the way. In her December 2015 annual report, the Auditor General revealed, “Most of the increase in what consumers pay for electricity has come from generation-cost increases, which currently account for about 60% of the overall cost of electricity. Generation costs have increased by 74% over the last decade.” The Auditor General goes on to say, “Global adjustment fees have increased significantly, from $650 million in 2006 to $7.03 billion in 2014.... Electricity consumers have already paid a total of $37 billion, and they are expected to pay another $133 billion in global adjustment fees from 2015 to 2032.” Again, it’s the result of signing expensive contracts to generate power that we don’t need in the province of Ontario.", "The IESO, the Independent Electricity System Operator, in its long-term outlook, has confirmed that the cost of delivering electricity has skyrocketed by $5 billion over the past decade. That’s a 32% increase. They note the drop in overall energy demand, which, inexplicably, in my mind, drives up the average unit cost of electricity. They talk about a 41% increase.", "These outlooks reiterate the dramatic drop in industrial energy use. Companies have either cut production or have moved out of Ontario, in spite of the benefit of the low Canadian dollar. This, by extension—again, basic labour economics—does not bode well for the future of this province when we see the loss of something like—I think the figure is now up to 350,000 lost manufacturing jobs in the last decade.", "So what do we have to look forward to, Speaker? More legislation, Band-Aid legislation like this one and long-term legislation like the climate change plan, which, again, will give a lot of people even more reason to be afraid to open up their electricity bill." ],

I say this, of course, not only as a parliamentarian but also as a physician. There’s a long list of medical illnesses—asthma, COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis.

While we were in government, we made strides towards those ends, so it’s not something that is novel, that the provincial Liberals really took on, that is their own creation.

Sure, you can go out, dig a well and pump water by hand.

I would say that the cost of electricity is the number one issue for the people of my riding and, I believe, for the people of Ontario. So it’s a good opportunity for me to spend a few minutes to talk about Bill 13, the electricity rebate act.", "I had a unique perspective last week because I was driving the tractor for the NDP float at the plowing match. It was fun. I was following the Liberal float. It must have been painful for the Liberals, because the people at the plowing match were not that receptive to the government party. Rural people are naturally friendly, naturally reserved, and not everyone at the plowing match was, and a lot of it had to do with electricity rates. Actually, they were pretty polite, considering some of the things that rural Ontario is going through with electricity rates.", "But as I was driving the tractor, I was reminded—I always remember comedy; I try to relate things to comedy. My favourite comic strip is the Wizard of Id. If you remember the Wizard of Id, there’s a little despotic king. He’s got a problem with his height. He’s a very short, despotic king. He’s got Rodney the knight, who’s his pseudo army, and he’s got the wizard, of course. The despotic king was standing in his castle, speaking to the peasants. It was an election campaign speech and he was promising, “When I’m elected, I promise a chicken for every pot.” The peasants were throwing things at him, and he couldn’t understand what was wrong. So he asked Sir Rodney, and Sir Rodney says, “Well, King, it’s because you confiscated their pots and melted them down for swords. So the chicken doesn’t do them any good.” That’s kind of like Bill 13. Bill 13 has got some good things in it, but Bill 13 is coming after years and years of struggle.", "If you go out to my riding—and I’m going to use my riding as an example and the ridings close to mine—we’ve had local businesses shut down. We’ve had big businesses shut down: just north of me, the Kidd Creek smelter in Timmins, a huge employer. Why did it shut down? The price of power. We’ve got sawmills in my riding that have shut down—the price of power. Pulp mills have shut down—the price of power. This isn’t something that happened yesterday. This has been building up over years.", "Quite frankly, people who have lost their jobs because of the high cost of power, people who are afraid of losing their homes and people who have actually cut the power—I have cases in my riding of people who cannot pay for the power, so the power has been cut off. And, yes, they’re going to have trouble with their septic system. They’re going to have trouble bathing. They’re going to have trouble, because these people won’t be able to buy a $2,000 or $3,000 generator or put up solar panels. These people have been thrust back 100 years. As the member from Haldimand–Norfolk said, he has been thrust back a few years burning wood. I burn wood as well, but if we had to, we could heat with hydro. A lot of these people can’t.", "The government is going to say, “Well, once again, they’re exaggerating.” Really? Over half a million people can’t keep up with their hydro bills; 60,000 have been cut off. Now the government throws out kind of a lifebuoy and expects people to be overjoyed. This suffering has gone on a long, long time.", "I believe the member from Thunder Bay–Atikokan mentioned that the NDP had the policy in a couple of election campaigns to take the HST off of hydro, the provincial portion. Actually, we fought to never, ever have the HST portion put on hydro; the Liberals put it on. So he’s right: We’ve been fighting for this for a long time. Actually, if the government hadn’t put it on in the first place—because I believe the numbers show they’re going to spend $1 billion doing this for the upcoming year. Well, that means that they’ve already taken $6 billion, give or take, out of people’s pockets in the last six years. Now, they’re saying, “Well, next year, we’re going to give you a rebate, and you should be happy.” People are angry, and they’re rightfully angry, because people are struggling.", "Delivery charges: You notice that they’re going to somehow help with delivery charges for the people in low-density rural Ontario. Fantastic—but we haven’t been able to pay those delivery charges for quite some time.", "I’ve had the opportunity of being in the House all day today. I actually like staying in House because you hear some interesting—it’s not quite the same on the TV in your office. It’s kind of interesting in the House. I was listening to the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington about how there are no delivery charges in other provinces, and I don’t really agree with that. There are delivery charges, but they’re paid for per kilowatt and they’re just in the price, and everybody pays the same delivery charge. What’s different in Ontario is that, instead of having so-many-cents per kilowatt or whatever on every kilowatt, we charge different prices depending on where you live. That is really hard on the people in low-density rural Ontario. And it does cost more, in some cases, to put hydro into low-density rural Ontario. It does. But you know what? We should make a decision: Are we Ontarians? Are we all one type of Ontarian? Or are we going to pay a penalty depending on where we live? That’s a big issue.", "So the government has finally come to the realization: “Oh, well, you know what? We’d better throw the people in rural Ontario a bone. We’d better throw them a bone.” But we don’t know if there’s a string attached to this bone, so if they grab the bone, then the next election, the string might pull the bone away again.", "But that’s the issue. People are angry because this issue has been around a long, long time. Are we against these proposals? No. But for the government to act like these proposals are somehow manna from heaven is absurd.", "I was in the House, I believe, earlier today, and I heard the Attorney General. I get along fairly well with the Attorney General—we’ve worked on several committees—and I appreciate something he said. He said, “Well, we’ve been in this government for over 10 years.” So at least he’s taking responsibility for some of the things that have happened in the last 10 years—because, yes, they did shut down coal. We’ve been pushing for that.", "They also put in the smart meters, which haven’t helped people in rural Ontario at all. They haven’t really conserved energy at all. They’ve been a big cost. So, again, they should take responsibility for that.", "They should take responsibility for the gas plants, because we all remember the gas plant scandal and why somehow the taxpayers of Ontario were on the hook for $1 billion because a couple of gas plants got moved in an election campaign. That’s also adding to the cost.", "What we’ve got here is we’ve got an issue where this has been brewing a long time. People specifically in rural Ontario have been suffering a long time. I believe now the suffering is starting to move into urban Ontario, because even with their lower delivery charges, they’re still starting to feel the pain. I don’t think they feel the pain yet as much as rural Ontario. That’s why the government is reacting, saying, “Well, there’s going to be some kind of rebate on delivery charges in rural Ontario.” That’s why they’re reacting. But, to the Attorney General’s credit, he did take responsibility for the 10 years.

The Liberal government has made it much worse; I’m not denying that. They haven’t helped the situation. But the people who started the process of separating everything out and making people pay different prices in different parts of the province—was it the Liberals? No. It was the Progressive Conservatives. We would have to question if they were progressive on that one, but they are the ones who started it.", "Speaker, do you know why? I’m sure you do, and I’m sure your friends there do—but do you know, for the people at home, why they did that, why they separated all these things out?

That, quite frankly, is ridiculous.", "I have a lot of friends who are Conservatives. I have some relatives, believe it or not, who are Conservatives, who I respect greatly. But they have got to wonder. At least you can depend on Conservatives to be Conservatives. Conservatives believe in the private sector. They believe that the market should control as much as possible, because they believe the market is always more efficient, except when it’s close to an election and they want to talk about how they’re going to try to save Hydro One. Come on. Conservatives—you used to be able to depend on a Conservative being a Conservative. That’s what I liked about Conservatives. I didn’t really agree with them lots of times—sometimes I did—but at least you knew where they stood. These guys, I don’t know. It’s tough with these guys.", "I distinctly remember—and this was before I was involved in politics on a provincial level—that when the Harris Conservatives tried to sell Hydro One, who fought them?

They were going to be the saviours. They get elected and they’re doing exactly the same thing that the Conservatives would have done.", "Let’s make it really clear, Speaker, why the government is trying to sell Hydro One. It’s got nothing to do with transit; it’s got nothing to do with infrastructure. It’s got to do with balancing the budget so they look good by the time the next election rolls around in two years. That’s all it’s about. They’re playing with numbers. They’re playing with numbers.", "Why that’s important to the people at home who get hydro bills, who can’t pay them and who are in fear of opening them—what that’s got to do with them is that every time we’ve privatized a part of the essential service of the generation and the transmission and the distribution of electricity, every time we’ve allowed a piece of that system to get privatized, it has cost the person who buys the electricity more money. Every time. The government can say, “Oh, no, we’re broadening the ownership”—which is another farce; they’re selling Hydro One. Don’t give me this “broadening the ownership” crap.", "Another one they shouldn’t ever say again is, “Well, we’re selling 60% but we’re going to keep 40% and that keeps us with controlling interest.” Again, come on. Even kids—the pages—could understand and would understand: If there are 10 people in the room and you have six on your side and four on the other side, the guys with six win. So if the public still owns 40% of Hydro One and they’re saying, “Well, you know what? I think maybe we should do this and this because the people might not be able to pay for this,” and the six on the other side say, “Well, we bought this company to make money and that’s what we’re going to do,” guess who loses? The four people who defend the public interest.", "How the government gets away with saying, “Well, we’ll have 40%, so we’ll still have controlling interest”—why they don’t get laughed out of the House is beyond me. I didn’t spend a lot of years going to school, but I paid dearly for my education, and six is always bigger than four—always.", "I’ve only got a couple of minutes left.", "Where this is so important is for the people at home, and not just individuals but businesses, who need to pay for hydro to create jobs.", "One time the Minister of Environment and Climate Change—I was speaking on hydro and he interjected that we didn’t have the most expensive hydro. Well, I’m not going to talk about other jurisdictions. I’ll talk about a business in my riding: Koch elevators. They’re a big farm; they’re a big grain drier. They do a lot of work for a lot of people, and they can’t afford hydro. In peak times when they are drying grain—you use a lot of hydro—you know how they generate their hydro? With diesel fuel. It’s cheaper in the province of Ontario for a company to burn diesel fuel than buy hydro through this government’s policies. You can talk all you want about other jurisdictions, but if it’s cheaper for diesel fuel and a company like Koch Farms—the Koch family, they’re not going to move. They’re proud northerners. They support northern Ontario and they do what they have to do to support the farmers of that area. A lot of other companies would have already moved.", "Yes, there are some good things in this bill, but after 13 years of Liberal mismanagement—and some of that mismanagement wasn’t even mismanagement; some was just due from inheriting an attempted deregulated mess from the Tories. So with some of the things they had no choice. But there are a lot of other things.", "I heard this from the member from Thunder Bay–Atikokan: that we had the chance to pass this unanimously without any debate.

That doesn’t make any sense.", "These are the guys who actually took a good program like the Green Energy Act—it was a good idea—and they actually used it to divide and conquer rural Ontario. They took a good idea like green energy and they polluted it so badly with their lack of moral compass—and plenty of Liberal ideology there—and they’ve almost totally destroyed green energy in this province. That’s the problem. In the last election, when people voted for Kathleen Wynne, they didn’t vote for that. They are sorely disappointed. I have a lot of people in my riding who are proud Liberals but certainly not proud of what’s happening now.", "We need to look at hydro from the perspective of the people in this province who depend on it as an essential service, and not just once in a while when an election comes up or when pressure gets too bad.

Obviously, the bill would rebate Ontario’s portion of the HST for families and small businesses. This is an average saving of about $130 annually. We’re increasing protection for rural or remote customers, and this would result in a benefit for these households of about 20%, or $540, on average. And we’re expanding the industrial conservation initiative, making it possible for newly eligible medium and large businesses to achieve savings of as much as a third of their bill. As a business person, someone who was in business just a couple of years ago before running for office, I know how important this is to our manufacturers across Ontario and therefore to job creation, and to the prosperity in so many communities across our province.", "Over the weekend, I was in my riding of Etobicoke Centre at a number of events.

It’s known as Vision Extrusions. We were there the Friday after the throne speech. I reference this, because, as everyone in the chamber will know, as part of the plan, as part of this particular legislation, we’re talking about improvements or enhancements to the industrial conservation initiative.", "I point that out because that particular business, Vision Extrusions, based in Vaughan, based specifically in Woodbridge, is a company that has been growing by leaps and bounds over the last number of years. At the same time, it is making continued investments in the work that they do and the hundreds and hundreds of people from my community and beyond my community that they’ve managed to employ because of their investments. They have been working closely with our government and others in the energy industry to arrive at a place where we can take a look at programs like the ICI program and provide this particular enhancement.", "I would say, with respect to the reaction that the Premier and the Minister of Energy received that Friday at Vision Extrusions, it is clear that by moving forward with this enhancement, we are helping in a meaningful way to support continued economic development in my community here in the GTHA. More jobs are being created, more families are being supported, and that business will continue to expand.", "As I’m fond of saying here, I hope members on all sides will continue this debate vigorously but, ultimately, make sure that we support Bill 13 and move it forward." ],

I don’t blame the companies; they’re private companies. The gas plants are private companies, and they all have to get their cut. That’s where it went wrong. The privatization of Hydro One—you’d expect it from the Conservatives. I’m extremely disappointed that the Liberals are going down the same route that is going to, in the end, make it an even more unaffordable essential service.

It took the media bringing this to light for them to actually address it.", "We know now why the Liberal government wanted this legislation drafted behind closed doors.

They were forced to bring in these reforms because they got caught.", "I’m going to talk a bit later—I brought a private member’s bill, and my colleague from Chatham–Kent–Essex; and you, Mr. Speaker, brought a bill even earlier than that—that the Liberals could have addressed all of this many, many times previously, and they didn’t. In fact, they voted unanimously against my private member’s bill. I’m not sure how they can say in good nature today that this is all their doing and that they want to correct, when they really have not truly addressed it.", "We in the Ontario PC caucus remain committed to developing political financing legislation that creates a level playing field and is in the best interests of Ontarians, not the Wynne Liberals’ own political survival. It’s about fairness and it’s about the ability to debate and to be a part of democracy.", "There are two significant caveats with this bill that I remain concerned about. One is that it does not end the cash-for-access pattern that has been displayed by the Liberals. This is the Liberals’ primary fundraising tool—almost $19.6 million for the Liberal Party coffers since Kathleen Wynne was sworn in back in 2013. According to the Globe and Mail, the Ontario Liberal Party held more than 150 intimate cash-for-access fundraisers in Ms. Wynne’s first three years in power.", "For example, on the evening of March 2, 2015, Premier Kathleen Wynne gathered with eight guests who paid $10,000 each for exclusive face time. Three months earlier, 22 donors spent $5,000 apiece to be entertained by Finance Minister Charles Sousa. Days later, eight people paid $5,000 each to attend a reception with then-Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli, according to the Globe. These were just three of the more than 150 intimate cash-for-access fundraisers that that party, the Liberal Party, held in the last three years. It is believed that some of these events were attended by the banks that made nearly $60 million off the privatization of Hydro One.", "Mr. Speaker, we’ve heard often that they want to spin this and say that we all have fundraisers.

Frankly, they have to look in the mirror and address those at some point in the future. In 2018, they’re going to have to actually listen to the people of Ontario, who did not give them a mandate, frankly, to sell Hydro One, which they keep going on about as the best thing for Ontarians, when it’s really what they believe is best for their short-term needs.", "The second caveat with Bill 2 is the amendments the government says that it plans on introducing. I’d like to know why they aren’t in the bill now, when we’re debating it. Again, it seems to me that as long as they’re controlling the message, as long as they have the total ability to utilize their majority and ram things through, then they’re happy. They don’t want to truly debate. I would suggest to you that at times, they usurp democracy, because they want to be able to just write the rules that are in favour of them. They want to continue to go down the road they’ve enjoyed for the last 13 years.", "The point is, these amendments could have been put in the bill when it was reintroduced. They prorogued after the summer.", "I want to pay tribute to my colleagues Steve Clark from Leeds–Grenville and Randy Hillier from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington, who spent the bulk of their summer going across this great province, doing what we’re supposed to do: listen to people, the people of Ontario, who brought their thought processes, who wanted to bring a number of amendments to the table. Yet this government prorogued, which actually killed that bill. They brought it back under a cloak of secrecy. They wrote it behind closed doors again, without any ability to have input into what that bill was going to be.", "Evidently, this government is looking to push Bill 2 through the Legislature, with apparently only modest participation by members of this House—and, by extension, frankly, the people we are privileged to represent. This never works out well, not when we, the members, are the ones responsible for explaining and justifying this legislation to the Ontario public.", "I’ll use an example: the Green Energy Act. There was one again where they usurped local democracy, and look at how much face time it gets in this House, Mr. Speaker. Just think of how much we’ve talked about the Green Energy Act this afternoon, which they purported to be the end of the earth for all. It was going to save the world. The environment minister still suggests his thought process is going to fix the planet. With all due respect, had they allowed open debate by democracy, had they allowed democracy to truly shine through, perhaps that bill would have come through and we wouldn’t have paid out $137 billion that is not going to benefit the Ontario public.", "I join my colleagues the MPPs for Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington and Leeds–Grenville in sounding the alarm on the government’s very peculiar proposal to transform this Bill 2 significantly at committee after second reading, if it’s passed. This is peculiar, as it means this minister has no intention of presenting and debating the bill’s chief principles and merits in this Legislature—cash-for-access, lobbying restrictions, members’ integrity, pre-election advertising and the enactment of it all.", "This no-collaboration, no-consultation approach toward the other parties is downright disturbing and frankly disrespectful. It’s part of the undemocratic pattern that we’ve seen unfold, certainly in my almost five years here. To use a phrase I use because of my riding, it’s almost Groundhog Day over and over again. “We’re going to tell you what’s good for you. We’re not going to ask for any input.” Although they will say, “We want to be open. We want to be collaborative. We want to be accountable,” yet they just steamroll what they believe is best for them, not for Ontarians.", "Remember the summer hearings? During the summer, the government dragged people out to hearings on the original Bill 201, the one that was riddled with loopholes and did not include a ban on the cash-for-access political fundraisers or restrictions on corporate or union members working on campaigns. It was all a sham, Mr. Speaker. Consider that they killed the original Bill 201 when they decided on a whim to prorogue, and that this new bill is only a hybrid version of the original as it precludes everything the original bill included at first reading. We now know that those 100 hours of hearings were all just for show.", "It hearkens back to the budget. Those hearings were held all across the province, giving people the false sense that they actually had a say in how the government was going to go forward with their budget, with something so critical; and yet, at the end of the day, they presented the budget even before those hearings could be recorded and actually reviewed. Respect for people who participate and sincerely want to see change has been neglected again.", "Third-party advertising appears to still have loopholes. This Liberal government has gotten itself into a serious pickle over political fundraising. From big-ticket fundraising to fundraising quotas, they’ve used and abused the rules around political fundraising, unlike anything seen before. They’ve clearly decided they’ve padded their bank accounts enough, so now it’s time to change the rules.", "I’m now going to talk a little bit about it, as I said earlier. Back in October 2015, I tabled a private member’s bill to adopt third-party advertising limits. The Premier and the entire Liberal caucus voted unanimously against capping third-party advertising in Ontario. To them, the Election Finances Act didn’t need much fixing, even though the legislation had been drafted over 30 years ago. As I mentioned earlier, my colleague Rick Nicholls from Chatham–Kent–Essex had tabled a similar bill in 2014, and you, Mr. Speaker, the great representative of Wellington–Halton Hills, had tabled a similar bill in 2011. Three different times: This government, if they were really sincere about fixing a challenge that they now say purportedly absolutely needs fixing, could have done it with no problem whatsoever, had they wanted to truly make it different and do the right thing.", "Now they seem like they’re keen to steamroll this reform forward, but here’s the catch: Their definition of third-party advertising does not include all advertising, does it? Bill 2 states that third-party advertising means “political advertising placed by or on behalf of a third party” and “an expense incurred in relation to,", "“(a) the production of a third party political advertisement, or", "“(b) the acquisition of the means of transmission of a third party political advertisement to the public.”", "I ask them: What about issue advertising? To me, third-party advertising means advertising in any broadcast, print, electronic or other medium, including by telephone, Internet or text messaging, if the purpose of the advertising is to take a position on any issue within the competence of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.", "My PMB had the definition of third-party advertising amended by adding “or issue advertising” after “political advertising.” Without such protection for voters, I wonder what kinds of loopholes or circumventions they’ve allowed in with their vague definition.", "It’s interesting what happens when the media gets involved and the public starts to challenge them on things that are actually seen to be self-serving. All of a sudden, they have now found religion on electoral reform and financing.", "The Liberal government voted against my motion, your PMB and also my colleague from Chatham–Kent–Essex. Three times in House, as I’ve stated, they had the ability, just in the short term, to actually change this, to do the right thing, to make it fair for all people and to actually respect democracy. Now, all of a sudden, because they got caught with their hand in the cookie jar, they decide they need to do this.", "If they don’t want to listen to me, and they think this is just because I’m on the opposite side of the House challenging them, what about the multiple recommendations from Greg Essensa? As Chief Electoral Officer, he has been calling on the government a number of times to do three things: (1) to adopt third-party spending limits, (2) to adopt third-party contribution limits, and (3) to strengthen the reporting requirements for third parties and adopt stricter registration and anti-collusion permissions.", "This is, as it was in my bill, about fairness. The principle of fairness is paramount and fundamental to engaging everyone in our democratic process. We want the new legislation to provide a guarantee that everyone plays by the same rules and that anyone, regardless of their financial status, is able to participate on an equal basis.", "Consider Mr. Essensa’s findings: In the 2000 general election there were 20 registered third parties, and they collectively spent $1.85 million. Of note, the collective advertising spending of third parties amounted to 5% of all election spending in this general election. There were three third parties that spent between $100,000 and $1 million, and there was one third party that spent over $1 million; it spent $1.08 million.", "In the 2011 general election, there were 22 registered third parties, and they collectively spent $6.08 million. Of note, the collective advertising spending of third parties amounted to 14% of all election spending in this general election. There was one third party that spent between $100,000 and $1 million, and there were three third parties that spent over $1 million, one of which spent almost $2.7 million.", "In the 2014 general election, there were 37 registered third parties, and they collectively spent $8.64 million. Of note, the collective advertising spending of third parties amounted to 17% of all election spending in this general election. There were six third parties that spent between $100,000 and $1 million, and there were three third parties that spent over $1 million, one of which spent almost $2.5 million. None of these expenses included such things as web-based campaign videos, telephone town halls or demon dialers.", "At the same time, voter turnout has been falling steadily. Ontario used to enjoy a 65% voter turnout, but then, by the 2000 election, a 57% turnout; in the 2007 election, a 54% turnout; in the 2011 election, a 48% turnout; and in the 2011 election, a 48% turnout. The 2014 election saw a record high number of spoiled ballots: 31,399 Ontarians declined their votes in the last election, the highest rejection level since 1975. But boosting voter engagement and participation is not Bill 2.", "I remain very concerned. Some of the other loopholes are how much money the government can actually spend. I hear from constituents on a fairly regular basis, even as recently as a couple of months ago, that the current Liberal government spending—I’ve asked the question, “How much are you spending on ads to tell us how wonderful health care is under your government?” What about the money to actually go to the front lines so people can get appointments at the time they need them, so they can actually get the medicines they need when they need them, as opposed to the self-serving messages we hear and have to be subjected to in our media?", "There are a number of challenges still within there. Just today, my colleague raised a concern in regard to the amendments the government says it is actually going to plan on introducing—they could have been put in the bill when it was reintroduced—and a breach of members’ privileges, when they can’t debate a partial bill.", "We have to ensure that the public trusts all of us, that they know there is actually debate going to happen on bills that are going to have such an impact on all of us over the years. This is a fundamental democratic issue, Mr. Speaker. If people do not trust that the government is here to serve them, the people we are given the privilege to serve, then it’s a dark day for democracy here.", "There are a number of very specific things I want to talk about, like cash for access, which, as I say, all of a sudden became a challenge when the media came out and actually started challenging the government. They all of a sudden sprang into action: “We’re going to fix this. We’re actually going to take the opportunity to change this,” although in 2015—I just have to say it again—they had the ability to amend it at that time with my PMB. Every single member across there has to go and look in the mirror and look at their constituents and answer the question, “Why did you vote against that bill then, and all of a sudden, just because the media brought it to your attention, now you’ve found there’s a huge need for change?”", "We know Premier Wynne allowed her ministers to fundraise from stakeholders with active files before their respective ministries. She also admitted that cabinet ministers were given fundraising quotas they had to meet. The Ontario government should not be for sale to the highest or the largest Liberal donor, and government contracts, grants or subsidies should never be traded for political favours. Unfortunately, the current legislation does nothing to address the perception that stakeholders trade cash for access. We will continue to hear of secret fundraising targets that give the impression that Liberal ministers are being instructed to cash in on their public office in order to fundraise. We’ve actually seen now, Mr. Speaker, that senior bureaucrats are going to be the veiled bagmen or bagwomen to go to these events, that it won’t necessarily be the minister anymore, but we still fear that the same old regime is in place.", "We still believe there’s a need for a public inquiry to investigate the fundraising practices of the Liberal Party and members of Premier Wynne’s cabinet. It is this unethical behaviour that is so offensive to Ontario families and businesses who work hard to pay their taxes and play by the rules. People shouldn’t have to ask whether or not there was a conflict of interest. Let’s make it clear right from the beginning.", "The coming government amendments: The government plans to introduce amendments to the bill during committee which will substantially alter the intent and function of the bill. In doing so, this government is depriving the Legislature of the ability to debate this new incarnation of the bill and its merits. Debate on a bill is meant to function as a safeguard for the public interest. It’s fundamental to what we do. That’s the whole reason you have the opposition and the third party: to be able to challenge the government, particularly in a majority situation that they, in my belief, are actually taking advantage of. They’re trying to steamroll through without debate, and that’s just simply not what Ontarians expect. It’s not what Canadians expect.", "Eliminating the pre-election government advertising: The Ontario Liberal Party shouldn’t be using taxpayer money on self-congratulatory messages, as I just mentioned. It’s shameful. I hear it day in and day out from people, that they can’t get a doctor, they can’t find the service for their children, and yet they have to hear on the radio how wonderful the system is.", "We’re very fortunate. I’m going to suggest that right off the bat. We still, as Ontarians, are very, very fortunate. But at the end of the day, what could we have with all of that money and all of the money that they spend on the highest debt level for a province in Canadian history? Some $330 billion is what the Auditor General is suggesting the debt will be. Just think if that money, $11 billion a year, could go into front-line programs and services in health care, in education, in social and community services, in accessibility concerns, for long-term care and seniors. Just think what we could have.", "I believe that we should have had stricter penalties. In my private member’s bill, I actually put in that if people were caught gaming the system—third-party advertisers gaming the system—they would not be able to participate in the next election. There has to be some teeth in any legislation that we put forward or they’ll just pay the fine. Just saying, “Well, you’re just going to have to pay a little fine if you get caught” is not acceptable. That’s not going to change the culture. It’s not going to change the activities and the way people look at this.", "The Chief Electoral Officer has said that collusion is too high a threshold to try and prove. So, Mr. Speaker, we want to ensure that there’s actually some teeth in this. We want to ensure that people have the ability to debate. We should have the ability to debate on behalf of the constituents we’re given the privilege to represent. We’ve brought this bill to the table. The Liberals unanimously voted against it. The media got involved and brought it out and the public perception got so strong that finally they came and said, “You’re right. It has to be fixed.”", "But if they were truly sincere, if they truly wanted to be who they purport themselves to be, they would open this bill up to ensure that it was going to be debated fairly, equally. We called for an inquiry. We called for a select committee to ensure all members of this Legislature and, in fact, the Green Party could have some stake in the game.", "At the end of the day, please respect democracy. Please respect the people that we’re all given the privilege to come and represent in this great House and ensure that we all have an ability to debate this bill before you ram it down and there’s no ability to change it." ],

I’ve got to raise some money for the Liberal Party of Ontario.” This caused great consternation across the province.

We can only think of perhaps the backroom deals that went on with the Premier before the election, promises that, if you were in fact to put forth third-party advertising, you’d get something in return.", "However, it’s unfortunate that the government is possibly—" ],

I was wondering all along, was this process going to be a genuine, transparent process? And in fact, I have to tell you that all the concerns that we had, all the fears that we expressed as a party and, actually, through documentation, when our leader, Andrea Horwath, wrote the Premier and said that this process clearly is a flawed process—you’ll remember, of course, that the Premier drafted, herself, the first draft of Bill 201. What we had argued was, let’s get this right. Let’s make sure that the informed voices, our independent officers of the Legislature, our electoral officer, the Auditor General, the Integrity Commissioner—let’s pull them in at the beginning so that we don’t have to backtrack when we see that there are gaps in the legislation.", "Not only are there gaps today, Mr. Speaker—after the prorogation we have a version of Bill 2 that went through the amendment process—but then we have this shadow. And that’s exactly what it is: We have the press release shadow from the clause-by-clause process that we went through. It’s very disappointing. It’s quite precedent-setting, Mr. Speaker, that we have a piece of legislation before us, and then we have these amendments—these talked-about amendments, the substantive amendments that this government has promised to bring to the Legislature when they actually had the opportunity to bring a complete bill before this House. They have been bragging about these amendments, these transformative, substantive amendments, and yet they did not include them in Bill 2.", "Our House leader, Mr. Vanthof, the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane, did write to the Speaker of the House on this very issue, and in support of the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington. In fact, our caucus was committed to that process—in that he had said an argument that is strengthened considerably by the September 8 prorogation of the House. So when the government prorogued, they had the opportunity to bring forward a piece of legislation which was whole, and yet they did not.", "Part of the correspondence that we sent the Speaker of the House said that, as of August 29, 2016—we wrote, “While we maintain strong reservations about the announcement, it was clear that the changes proposed were, in the government’s own words, ‘extraordinary’”—so they were admitting that there are changes coming to Bill 2—“and would drastically alter the bill.” We don’t really know what that bill is going to look like going forward.", "“Had the House not prorogued, the government would have a viable, if problematic, argument for waiting until the next round of clause-by-clause consideration to introduce these substantive changes. Although the government had the option to redraft the bill and introduce new legislation that reflected this change in direction, first reading committee hearings do not force the government to proceed with a bill. A case for consistency could be made to continue with Bill 201 and make the amendments at the next appropriate stage.”", "So why I’m sharing this with the folks that are watching, including my parents, is that the government had the opportunity to bring forward a piece of legislation which we could debate on the floor of this House, as is our right to do so as members. There is a parliamentary tradition in this place that we have the opportunity to see a whole piece of legislation.", "The reason why I’m a little sensitive to this is that we did travel around the province. I do want to thank the clerks, the research staff and the translation staff who actually helped make that process a good process.", "I also want to thank the citizens who came out. They came out from across the province. Of course, they were not speaking to the substantive changes because these substantive changes were not part of the draft legislation. But they did raise some very good concerns around government advertising, around the conflict of interest and, ultimately, about the cash-for-access culture that has become part and parcel of this place.", "I also wanted to thank the independent officers of the Legislature who gave us good advice, some of which is not captured in Bill 2, especially from the Auditor General and her needed oversight over government advertising—not part of this legislation at all.", "I want to thank the leader of the Green Party. He came. He wasn’t part of the process of travelling around the province, of course, but he did come to speak to the committee. I did have the opportunity, actually, just last Monday to talk. We were sitting on a panel on migrant farm workers together, and he said, “What is going on?” I explained, and he said, “So it was basically a farce.” And I said, “Basically, it was.” I hope he doesn’t mind me sharing that. But he didn’t have to do the travelling.", "There is a sense of frustration on this side of the House—and I think you got that yesterday from the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington. I will say also that the Conservative members were so frustrated during clause-by-clause that we got to the fifth clause after five hours. The Attorney General brought down a little press release, the statement from Minister Naqvi, which was read right into the record on the fifth amendment—unprecedented, really; not ruled out of order, of note—and which drastically changed the work that we were doing in that committee.", "It’s understandably frustrating. The PC committee members who had served the entire summer until this point walked out. I am pleased, though, that I was able to do some of their work for them because we had some shared concerns around transparency, around accountability, around conflict of interest, around the integrity of the process, to be quite fair.", "When this press release was read into the Hansard at clause-by-clause, we basically got a little show. One of the members was asked to read it into the Hansard.", "I think, for us, because we were consistently trying to put the electorate at the centre of this process—and there was a lot of talk about leveling the playing field. Even when we were in Ottawa, there did seem to be moments where we were actually trying to figure out third-party advertising and advocacy groups weighing in on elections. At the very beginning, there was a moment when I thought, “Okay, we’re invested in this.” Even the reporter from the Ottawa Citizen, David Reevely, said, “It seems like this might be—is this a real process?” I said, “You know, it’s early days.”", "So it is obviously disappointing for us to have prorogation and have this reset, and then have this government introduce this shadow of this piece of legislation and not have it for us, as parliamentarians, to actually debate. It seems a fair thing for us to have some frustration over. That is why I think our House leader goes on to say here:", "“However, because of the prorogation, this House is no longer dealing with Bill 201, and the government was required to table the bill as a result, which significantly changes the way we should examine the current bill. I share those frustrations. While it is true that all parties speak to amendments during the course of debate, such a blanket statement fails to reflect the reality that opposition parties did not have input in the drafting of government legislation and can only affect it through amendments.”", "We have the Attorney General, who has said, “Bill 2 is here.” I’m going to talk about some of the weaknesses that are still contained within Bill 2, and that we are still committed to trying to fix, because we have to honour the people who came to the committees over the summer. We have to be true to and respectful of the people of this province.", "We are going to continue to try to make Bill 2 a better bill. We’re still going to follow that course. But to have the minister responsible for the introduction of Bill 2, the Attorney General himself, introduce this piece of legislation, then also say that there’s this other part of it that will substantively transform Bill 2—I think it’s precedent-setting for this House, which is why we’re disappointed with the determination that the Speaker made earlier.", "Simply put, Bill 2 did not have to be rushed back in an incomplete state. This is important. With no Canadian context to offer insight into the possible impact of the proposed yet undisclosed changes, it can be argued that the government has a responsibility to present these ideas before the Legislature so that they could be appropriately debated, in keeping with parliamentary tradition.", "And there are legitimate questions as to how such things would work. What changes to existing legislation are required to implement a new process? Most importantly, there is a responsibility to provide Ontarians with the opportunity to reasonably examine these proposed changes both in the context of a bill and through their elected representatives on all sides of the House, including New Democrats, including Progressive Conservatives.", "I’m sure that we would all agree that any member making such a charge should allow the opportunity to do the necessary research to ensure that such a step is appropriate. That did not happen.", "The government has every right to use its powers to pass legislation; however, this right is exercised in conjunction with the opposition’s responsibility to hold the government to account, an obligation that requires a minimum standard of disclosure, so that MPPs on all sides of the House can do their jobs in an informed manner.", "This does set a very dangerous precedent, I think, Mr. Speaker. Although Bill 2 may not be subject to the same degree of public scrutiny as other bills, the government’s attempt to minimize parliamentary scrutiny has the potential to set a dangerous precedent, and now it has passed. This can happen with any piece of legislation going forward now, because any future government that seeks to change policy in the province of Ontario can cite this case.", "That seems to be the way that this Liberal government is operating. This is not the government that Kathleen Wynne, the Liberal Premier of this province, promised the people. You’ll remember, Mr. Speaker, that she promised a new government, ruling from an activist centre, being open and transparent. We’re debating a bill that we don’t have all the materials for. It is really astonishing. It’s astonishing that this is the new open and transparent Kathleen Wynne government. And yet this bill that we have before us is not the whole bill.", "New Democrats at the committee—105 amendments were made—tried to reflect the voices of the people whom we heard throughout the committee process. We tried to bring substantive changes to banning cash-for-access by tightening conflict-of-interest rules. The Liberals voted it down. We tried to ban partisan government advertising, which would ensure that the Auditor General has oversight of advertising. This government voted it down.", "It’s interesting, because when the Auditor General came to the committee, she basically said—and it was very powerful—that her job right now is essentially a joke, because the Government Advertising Act was so changed through the Budget Measures Act, 2015, that she can only say whether or not a commercial or advertising is compliant with that piece of legislation. Well, that’s a flawed piece of legislation, which gives the government full access to use Ontario taxpayer dollars to advertise whatever they want. That is a, I think, fundamental breach of trust and breach of our democracy, by using their money to advertise government initiatives and put a spin on it.", "In fact, during the committee, the Auditor General was very clear. She gave us three very good examples of where she would have said that this government has overstepped that line. One, of course, was the climate change advertising, where we see David Suzuki talking about the Ontario Climate Change Action Plan before this House even saw it. Looking scared, he’s delivering a speech to scared schoolchildren. We, as a Legislature, had not seen that piece of legislation.", "There was the issue of $160 billion on infrastructure. Well, the Auditor General says it is not clear, it is not completely open for this government to say that they’re spending that because that covers potentially three other successive governments. It’s a 12-year commitment. And yet this government says we’re doing this now.", "There are so many examples which cause the taxpayers of this province and the citizens of this province to really question what is happening here when they watch their TV and they see this government advertising. One constituent came to me after spending eight and a half hours in an emergency room waiting room. The commercial saying that they have reduced wait times by such-and-such an amount came on four or five times. This constituent was so angry because she had to sit in that waiting room for eight and a half hours and watch government advertising saying that those wait times don’t exist anymore.", "The final example that she mentioned was the ORPP. And, of course, for the government to say that they were going to address the pension crisis—it was probably, just to use the Premier’s language, “a stretch goal.” We all wanted that lady to get over the river, but to spend $70 million to basically lobby the Trudeau government at a cost to the taxpayers was really, I think, another example of this government using their power—their majority power—and this very weak piece of legislation called the Government Advertising Act to spend taxpayer dollars to put their spin on what is happening in the province of Ontario. I believe the Auditor General when she says that her job now to oversee this is a joke. She actually warned the government that this would happen back in 2015.", "So we really fought—it was really a lot of what I talked about at the committee. But also, we looked to protect free speech while cracking down on super-PAC-style third-party political advertising. The government also voted this down, this amendment that we brought forward. We brought forward amendments around new rules for lobbyists, because you can’t talk about cash-for-access and not address the lobbyists and the lobbying act, and, of course, the Liberal government voted this down.", "Finally, and, I think very importantly, we also said that we need new rules for conflict of interest. This is to address what really is the fundamental issue of why we started down this journey as a Legislature. When the public at large learned, through the media reports from the Toronto Star and the Globe, that massive amounts of money were being donated to the Liberal Party, which were directly connected to a ministry and a stakeholder, they were aggravated, and for good reason. They definitely felt—and this came through and I’ll read some direct quotes from Hansard—the citizens of this province heard very clearly, I think, that policy and legislation were being influenced by donations. This came forward at every stop along the way.", "And just to go back to the premise of what we’re dealing with, Bill 2 has some good parts in it. We all agreed to ban corporate and union donations. We all thought that the limits should come down significantly, and they have. Those are good components of Bill 2. But what it doesn’t address, really and ultimately, is cash-for-access because that is directly connected to conflict of interest. So we have a piece of legislation here which is silent on conflict of interest.", "The Integrity Commissioner was pretty clear on this, as well. We would love to see the Integrity Commissioner have additional powers to ensure that conflict of interest is not happening. Right now the only avenue that we have in this Legislature is for one MPP to file a complaint against another MPP, which is a very uncomfortable thing to do, I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, as I have had to do it. I think that there needs to be a strengthened position from the Integrity Commissioner’s office, where perceived conflict of interest can be investigated, because this government has given that Integrity Commissioner many examples to look into.", "To go back, though, how we got here is that once the exposure of these high-priced-ticket, stakeholder-directed fundraisers started to happen—I go back to July 6: “An Inside Look at Cash-for-Access Ontario Liberal Fundraisers.” This was from Adrian Morrow. He writes, “On the evening of March 2, 2015, Premier Kathleen Wynne gathered with eight guests who paid $10,000 each for exclusive face time. Three months earlier, 22 donors spent $5,000 apiece to be entertained by Finance Minister Charles Sousa. Days later, eight people shelled out $5,000 each to attend a reception with then-Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli.", "“These were just three of more than 150 intimate cash-for-access fundraisers the Ontario Liberal Party held in Ms. Wynne’s first three years in power. At the events, contributors paid thousands of dollars each to bend the ears of the Premier and members of her cabinet privately, typically over cocktails and dinner at five-star hotels or high-end restaurants.", "“The Liberals have refused to disclose who bought tickets to the fundraisers….", "“A Globe and Mail investigation has assembled likely guest lists….", "“The analysis reveals that attendees included construction firms with lucrative government infrastructure contracts, electricity companies with an interest in seeing the government continue outsourcing much of the province’s power generation, pharmaceutical corporations that depend on the province to list their drugs for coverage and the banks that made nearly $60 million off the privatization of Hydro One.", "“There is a pattern of industry-specific events,” the article goes on to say, “in which corporate elites, union leaders and lobbyists in a given sector were invited to pay for time with the Premier or the minister involved in their file,” outside of business hours.", "That’s the other piece. We all have a responsibility to meet with stakeholders. Stakeholders can come to this place during business hours.", "“Cash-for-access,” the writer goes on to say, “has become the Liberals’ primary fundraising tool. From Ms. Wynne’s February, 2013, swearing-in to the end of 2015, the party held 223 fundraisers, of which 159 were private affairs for 50 or fewer guests. After event costs, the Liberals collected $19.6 million for party coffers.”", "Interjections." ],

It has no conflict-of-interest provisions to ban ministers from fundraising among stakeholders, nor does it require politicians to disclose when they are lobbied.”", "A reasonable person would conclude, “‘No one would have dropped that type of money unless they thought or knew it would help them gain access and be listened to,’ confided one insider at a major corporation that does business with government. ‘A two-hour dinner with the Premier or minister is pretty watertight when it comes to an opportunity to have your voice heard.’”", "This is the context and this is why the context is important.", "So the summer went on, we still kept meeting with people and we still kept raising the issues, but then, on August 4, the Premier once again was noncommittal on ending cash-for-access fundraising but was “very open to having that conversation.” There are a lot of conversations that happen here in this place.", "The problem is that as the summer went on, the committee members—the PC members and myself—discovered that the government was not serious about addressing the cash-for-access issue.

In this letter, the Premier says, “Our government is in the midst of election finance reform through an open, transparent and credible process that includes engaging opposition parties....”", "What we have before us is not an open process, it is not a transparent process and it certainly is not a credible process that we are dealing with here.

It has been an issue, with political staffers in ministers’ offices taking the lead on stakeholder relations for fundraising. This has been well documented. There is a complaint before the Integrity Commissioner. Unfortunately, the Integrity Commissioner does not have the legislation with which he can do his job, which we tried to change in this process.", "You have so many loopholes that the natural conclusion you can come to, after travelling the summer, listening to Ontarians, responding to this constantly shifting, make-it-up-as-you-go-along election financing from the Liberal government, is that they are going to do whatever they’re going to do because that’s what they’ve done so far, and past behaviour is very indicative.", "The good thing, though, is that people have caught on; they really have. The media watched it. We did make an effort to stay in touch. This is sort of inside baseball a little bit, but it does affect our democracy. That’s the key part: There was such a breach of trust, I think, when this entire situation was exposed that the people of this province really and genuinely, and for good reason, wondered, “What is going on here? Why is the Premier sitting in a corporate boardroom on Bay Street with people who want something directly related to a piece of legislation that is currently before the House?” Any reasonable person would conclude that there is a conflict of interest there, and the Integrity Commissioner did make that ruling as it related to the finance minister and the Minister of Energy. That’s very clearly outlined in his report back to this Legislature: that a reasonable person would conclude that if you have five or six bankers in a boardroom with the Minister of Energy and they are bidding on Hydro One—they’re part of the bidding process; they’re seeking part of Hydro One—that a reasonable person would conclude that that’s a conflict of interest.", "Bill 2 was an opportunity to address that breach.

So much for openness; so much for transparent; so much for leading from the activist centre.", "Then we have this promise that, “Change is coming.

The scandal was the Liberals using their advantage as the governing party to collect large cheques from people seeking favour with cabinet members. It was cabinet members trading access for cash, or giving the appearance of doing so.”", "It goes on to say—this is an editorial of the Globe and Mail, September 1: “Do the Liberals now expect anyone to believe that, just because a cabinet minister can’t attend a fundraiser, he or she won’t be beholden to major donors?”", "I would say no. The people of this province know what is going on, and they have the evidence to show it. It’s very unfortunate that this is a missed opportunity that the Premier and the Liberal government of Ontario have really just thrown away, when we had the opportunity to make Bill 2 a comprehensive bill which would truly restore some confidence in our democratic process and our democratic institutions.", "We are going to continue, as this drama unfolds—because who knows what’s coming? We don’t know. We don’t know what’s in store for us. We don’t know what’s in store for our constituency associations. But we do know that the Liberals have $20 million in the bank, and we do know how they got it." ],

The auditor was public about criticizing the government, saying that if that ad had been under the old rules, she would have deemed it to be partisan. But basically, the rules have been weakened so that she can no longer comment on it. She also pointed out the ORPP ads—some $70 million being spent—that I’m sure would also be deemed to be partisan. The government does have a real advantage in that they can spend money on essentially partisan advertising that the other parties can’t.", "Mr. Speaker, I think the new aspect of this bill that the government has brought forward, trying to ban MPPs from any fundraising, frankly, is ridiculous. To compare the cabinet ministers going out and having a goal of $500,000 to raise, versus individual opposition MPPs running a fundraiser once a year—which is in no way selling access; it’s just raising money for a riding association. I see absolutely nothing wrong with MPPs doing a fundraiser to be able to fund an election every four years. I think that’s part of this bill where I guess the government is just trying to be vindictive or something, or trying to make it seem like the activities of opposition MPPs are somehow similar to selling access, like the cabinet ministers have been doing." ],

It is your primary job in this House to deliver complete information, not only to elected members but to the public at large, especially on something as important as electoral finance, which will play a role in deciding future governments. You’re abdicating your responsibility to do that, and I hope members of the community and the electorate judge you accordingly, because you are really diluting the future process by not giving the complete picture.", "Secondly, the criticism has been levied on this bill and on the previous actions of the government by the Integrity Commissioner and the Auditor General in respect to campaign financing and also advertising, things that have happened in the past that should never have happened. We look to other jurisdictions to see legislative road maps. Let’s look to Alberta, where that government, under Rachel Notley, an NDP government—their first order of business was to bring in electoral finance reform to ban corporate and union donations. They didn’t have to wait until they got caught—not that I think they ever would, because they have high moral standing in that government. But they didn’t wait; they did it immediately because it was the right thing to do." ],

A number of my colleagues worked incredibly hard, as did members on the opposition benches, to travel the province and hear from people.

Creating a clear definition of what third-party advertising actually means—I think that makes a lot of sense also.

  "text" : [ "Good morning, Madame Speaker, and thank you for the opportunity to rise and speak with respect to Bill 194. Last week, I spoke with respect to this matter and I had some harsh words with respect to Bill 194. I think they were entirely fair. The concern I had and have with Bill 194 is this: At the time that it was being enacted, we knew that the US DOC had recommendations to President Trump with respect to Bill 232.", "That particular bill was considering three options with respect to trade tariffs which Canada could be subject to. The concern I raised with the government was that Bill 194 was an antagonistic measure in response to something happening in New York.", "While there may be some merit to that as an option of last resort, as a starting point it is imperative that we try a diplomatic approach to deal with our friends in the US, to try to encourage President Trump to consider other alternatives, specifically with reference to Bill 232. The reason why I said that was in Bill 232, there are three options that were presented to President Trump. Now, it’s really interesting to note the dates. As of last Wednesday, the recommendations to President Trump were to be considered on April 11 or thereafter. We stood in this House and debated at length about the effect of poking the President in the eye when something as detrimental to Canadian steel—and let’s just digress here for a moment.", "We have three integrated steel producers in our country, all of which are located in Ontario and one of which is located in my community of Sault Ste. Marie. The Sault Ste. Marie steel market cannot survive two of the three options presented by Ross in Bill 232. My suggestion, my strong encouragement to the government last Wednesday, was, “Let us not poke the President of the United States in the eye. Let us have meaningful and diplomatic negotiations with him to demonstrate to the President that the US economy requires ours as much as we need them.”", "At that time, I had already reached out to State Senator Schmidt in Michigan. He shared my concerns. Thereafter, I spoke with the senator, and he is very worried that Michigan, his home state, will immediately proceed into a recession if Algoma in Sault Ste. Marie closes. The Upper Peninsula in Michigan relies heavily on the tourism industry which comes from our community in Sault Ste. Marie. They rely heavily on providing Sault Ste. Marie’s Algoma mill with the raw materials to produce steel. Many communities in Michigan will fold if my community of Sault Ste. Marie folds.", "The auto sector, Detroit, will be hit incredibly hard. Minnesota will be hit hard. Wisconsin will be hit hard. The Virginias will be hit hard. There are a number of states in the US that will suffer dramatically if Canada suffers as a result of these trade tariffs.", "My strong encouragement to the government last Wednesday was that this is not the time for poking the President of the US in the eye. It is the time to be diplomatic and reach out to our friends. On Thursday, I stood up and made a member’s statement and said, “Let us all make one phone call. If we split up a list of names and we all make one phone call and demonstrate to a person south of the border in power what this tariff will do to their country, to their economy, to the people they represent, that is the way we will resolve this issue with the US over trade, and steel in particular.”", "I find it very interesting, and a little too coincidental, that we sat here on Wednesday—a full month and a half before President Trump was supposed to make a decision on Bill 232—and on Thursday, the very next day, a full month and a half before he was supposed to make his decision, President Trump announced that he was not even going to proceed with any of the recommendations that the DOC presented to him. In fact, he took it a step further. Option 1 under Bill 232 suggested a 24% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum. President Trump decided to go with a 25% tariff on steel, and it’s expected that that decision will be announced later today and made official.", "My community cannot sustain that tariff. My community will not be able to survive. There will be 2,800-plus people in Sault Ste. Marie who will be unemployed. There will be 6,000-plus people on pension in Sault Ste. Marie who will not be able to find work and will not receive their pensions. The indirect spinoff: There are another 6,500 people in Sault Ste. Marie that have indirect employment within our steel plant. They will lose their work. In a community of 72,000-plus people, imagine the effect of 6,000-plus pensioners no longer having income and no longer being able to find employment, and 3,000 people, almost, losing full-time employment with a median wage of $80,000-plus a year. Imagine another 6,500 people that will lose their employment as a result of the indirect employment they obtain out of the steel plant.", "The effects are highly detrimental to my community, but it will flow. Other communities in the north will not be able to survive. A number of our employees at Algoma Steel work in the surrounding areas outside of Sault Ste. Marie; a number of the pensioners reside outside of Sault Ste. Marie. I said last week that mills like Domtar in Espanola and EACOM in Nairn Centre will not be able to survive, because there will no longer be train access, because Huron Central Railway will shut down. This has such a serious effect.", "I appreciate the government’s efforts with respect to Bill 194; I appreciate the process that was considered. I’m curious if the Premier attempted, and I hope she did, to reach out to the state officials in New York before resorting to Bill 194. I would be encouraged to know whether or not those attempts were made, and I would like to know what the fruits of those discussions were, because I’m sure our Premier would have sought to speak with those state officials in New York before resorting to Bill 194. I would like to know what stemmed from those discussions, but notwithstanding, it was premature. We had a month and a half to address Bill 232, because that is the bigger risk. And you know what? That risk is now in front of us. That risk is real, and it has my community shaking. It has many communities shaking within this country and the other steel markets within Ontario. And it has people in the US shaking.", "There is room for Bill 194 as an option of last resort, but I still beg all of my friends—" ],

We have some serious concerns with some of the context around this bill. The principle of the bill, we could support, but there are several issues with this legislation, particularly when you look at the greater context. When I made the opening statement, the response to the minister—perhaps my most quoted statement in the House since I’ve been here—it’s: This is not the time to poke the President in the eye. Really, this isn’t the time to do that. This isn’t the time to do that. The government has chosen to do that—as a legislator, something that’s perhaps even more telling and egregious.", "So today we’ve got the francophone youth Parliament here. Often I go to schools and I explain how the legislative process works: The government introduces a bill, first reading, second reading, it goes to committee, where experts and lay people and people impacted, like people from the steel industry across this province, like workers across this province, auto workers across this province, people in the forestry sector, people in supply management—they could all be impacted, indirectly and directly, by this legislation. The government says this legislation is to protect workers. We say we have to be cognizant and recognize its impact on all workers. The way that is supposed to happen in our system is: After second reading, a bill goes to committee, which hears the opinions of the people of the province who are impacted by the legislation. Amendments are put forward. Then, it goes to third reading, where it is again fully debated, and obviously, with a government majority, it will pass.", "If used or interpreted incorrectly, the impact of this legislation could be international—obviously, its impact will be international. But some of the impact, the collateral damage of this legislation—I don’t think any of us can really gauge what that’s going to be. The best way to gauge that is to ask experts to come to committee and comment on the legislation. That’s how our parliamentary system is built—but not with this legislation. This legislation is having first, second and third reading with absolutely no input from anyone other than the governing party, which is now in the dying days of its term. Now is especially the time to make sure that its legislation is transparent and that all impacts are evaluated. In the last three months of their term, as a totally lame-duck government, they now have decided to put forward legislation without any input from the public, from impacted workers and, quite frankly, from this House.", "There has been no opportunity to put forward amendments. It’s one thing if we—the opposition parties and the government—can put forward amendments and they are debated and rejected, which happens here all the time. It always frustrates us, because we don’t have the mandate. In a majority government, the governing party has a mandate; they put forward legislation. It’s our role to criticize. It’s also our role to put forward amendments to make the legislation better on behalf of the people of Ontario and on behalf of the people we represent. So we’re often frustrated that we put forward amendments and the government routinely doesn’t accept any. That’s frustrating. But in this case, the government has put forward a time allocation motion that strips the whole process altogether. This legislation came from the Premier’s office. The rest of the whole process on this piece of legislation is, quite frankly, a sham. No changes are going to be made, no matter what anyone says in this House, because there was no committee process.", "Often, when time allocation motions are put forward, we raise the issue that committees should travel across the province so that people across the province will have a chance to have input on proposed legislation. That’s almost always not the case. The committee hearings are held in Toronto. We often criticize the government for seeming to be more cognizant of the wishes of the folks who live close to Queen’s Park than the outsides of the province. That’s also the case with this. The folks who work in steel in Sault Ste. Marie—they obviously don’t have a care in the world about them. If they actually had allowed a committee to sit and talk about it, they should have gone to the Soo, to Hamilton, to places like that, that are going to be impacted, perhaps, by the collateral damage of this bill. They should have toured the forestry sector in northern Ontario. They are very worried about the trade negotiations that are happening right now and about the collateral damage that this bill can have.", "But in this case, we don’t even have to mention that they didn’t travel to other parts of the province. With this piece of legislation, it’s obvious that the Liberal government of the day doesn’t care about anyone, or anyone’s opinion, whether it be lay or expert, other than their own opinion. It’s very obvious, Speaker. With this piece of legislation, the only people that the Liberals truly care about are themselves and their own interests. If that wasn’t the case, they would be happy to have committee hearings and hear from trade experts, from experts in various industries and from procurement experts; to talk about the best way to implement this type of legislation and how it could best be done. They would be more than happy to do that. But, Speaker, they’re not. They have truncated, they have kiboshed the whole process. There are no committee hearings—none. Not even an attempt to talk to the public—none.", "This open and transparent government—that was the last campaign; now they’re the fairness government. Where is the openness and transparency when you take out the committee process? You just take it out. They’re not only poking the President in the eye, they’re poking everybody in the eye because, quite frankly, they don’t seem to care. They care about themselves. This bill may very well not be about the next election, but it certainly appears to be so because they’ve made absolutely no attempt to make sure that it’s done correctly. They’ve made no attempt." ],

However, we are here to talk about something important: our work to protect Ontario businesses and made-in-Ontario jobs.", "Recently a tide of protectionism and protectionist sentiments has risen across America. Whether it’s the unfair NAFTA negotiations, discriminatory Buy American legislation or the new proposed steel tariffs that would severely tax any imports to the US, one thing remains clear: Our partners south of the border have no intention of exempting Canadian workers and businesses from the impacts of their economic nationalism. That’s why we have to be prepared to respond to these unfair policies. We have to stand up for our workers and our businesses. This bill does exactly that.", "It would irresponsible of the government to allow US states—and I want to emphasize here, we’re talking about states; this is a province-to-state interaction, not a national trade interaction, which of course we have no jurisdiction over.", "But it would be irresponsible of our government to allow US states to continue winning public procurement contracts in Ontario while our own businesses are shut out by state laws from similar opportunities in those American states. This is why we need to pass the Fairness in Procurement Act, because, as the government of Ontario, we do control public procurement in Ontario. That’s the thing that this bill addresses: public procurement in Ontario. When Ontario taxpayers spend money, we should have a fair playing field vis-à-vis the US states across the border. It will act as a powerful deterrent and, as a last resort, would allow us to level the playing field.", "I want to share with the House the relationship that we have with our partners in the US. Hopefully, this will provide more insight into why we are proposing this piece of legislation. Speaker, in 2015-16, the Ontario government awarded more than 500 US-based businesses with contracts worth approximately $460 million. A third of this, approximately $160 million, went to 77 New York-based corporations. Ontario’s economic success is linked to our strong business relationship with the US, but this isn’t just a competitive advantage for our province; our partnership underpins the competitiveness of this entire region. Both Ontario and New York state benefit enormously from a strong and integrated partnership that supports good jobs on both sides of the border.", "Yet, as we know, New York state and Texas state have passed Buy American legislation, which undermines the spirit of our partnership and gives their businesses and workers an unfair edge. We are concerned that other states are considering similar proposals. In the face of these developments, our government cannot and will not stand idly by and have Ontario businesses discriminated against. While we do not think it is optimal, we want the US to know that we are ready and willing to respond if necessary.", "We are fully committed to standing up for Ontario businesses, and I encourage the opposition and the third party to get some backbone and join us in doing so too. This is not something to make political, and, frankly speaking, I do not think it is fair when the parties opposite spend debate time finding that it is. This is about hard-working Ontarians and protecting the jobs of hard-working Ontarians. Our government will continue to advocate for open, transparent and competitive procurement and to stand up for the well-being of Ontario workers.", "That’s why our Premier has met or spoken with nearly 40 US governors to talk about the benefits of our partnership. Think about that: Almost 40 of the US governors have spoken with Premier Kathleen Wynne. I am proud to stand beside a Premier who continues to lead advocacy efforts when it comes to protecting Ontarians. It ultimately resulted in New York state scaling back its Buy American legislation to be less harmful than earlier versions of their proposed Buy American legislation.", "But, Speaker, it’s not enough from our partners south of the border. Our government will stand up for Ontario workers and businesses, especially in the face of US protectionism. We’re sending a clear message. Our US partners need to know that if they choose protectionism, we will respond. Our government has fought hard to protect the values we all hold dear and to protect the jobs that help sustain those values and our way of life. Our government has never been afraid to do whatever is necessary to stand up for the workers of Ontario.", "Buy American protectionist policies at the state level can have an impact on vital economic sectors like construction, sectors that provide good-paying jobs to our highly skilled workers and businesses that provide affordable goods and services to our citizens.", "Our government believes in a level playing field for Ontario businesses and workers. We must protect Ontario businesses and Ontario jobs in the face of these harmful Buy American policies. We have been clear that if any state takes action to harm Ontario workers and businesses, we would respond in kind. That is why our government introduced the Fairness in Procurement Act, 2018, the bill that we are debating in third reading here today.", "This legislation, if passed, would provide Ontario with an important tool to ensure our industries, our businesses and our workers are fairly treated. It would provide Ontario with the ability to quickly and decisively respond to US subnational jurisdictions—that is, states and municipalities—that uphold their own Buy American policies. I think it’s important to note that first of all, the American subnational, the American state or municipality, would already have enacted their own Buy American legislation. The proposed Fairness in Procurement Act is also meant to discourage other US subnational jurisdictions, both at the state and the local level, from considering similar Buy American provisions.", "The people of Ontario and New York state have benefited enormously from our close and integrated relationship. Our government would like to keep it that way. But now, our businesses are being blocked from bidding on US public procurement contracts, even though US businesses from New York state can bid on Ontario public procurement policies—public procurement paid for by Ontario taxpayers.", "Our close relationship with many US states is measured beyond the value of goods and services that flow between our borders. It is a relationship that relies on its deeply interconnected economies, and we believe strongly in keeping it that way. Ontario and New York state have both benefited from this deep integration, from good jobs on both sides of the border to competitive growth and access to government procurement opportunities.", "Beyond economic integration, we also share similar values—" ],

We’re just identifying a problem that we already know exists. So I am curious: What is the solution that is being brought forward? We are not hearing it.", "There are a number of initiatives that we can be undertaking to more appropriately utilize our time, but we’re spending our time doing other things that, quite frankly, aren’t helpful. But I’m happy to recognize the importance of climate change as an issue. I believe that the government’s efforts through the cap-and-trade program are sorely lacking in that area. I do not believe that there is any sense in sending money from our province to foreign jurisdictions when we could use that money here in Ontario. We can use that money to assist businesses here in Ontario that are struggling.", "Yesterday when I rose, I spoke about the climate change motion. I referenced some initiatives going on within my community that would make a significant impact on environment-related issues. I spoke about the Ellsin tire plant in Sault Ste.

Marie. We actually have the technology available where we could take tires, recycle them, break them down right to carbon black. We could produce new tires. It’s not the recycling that exists to date. This is a great environmental initiative. Think of the amount of landfill space occupied by tires. Think about the disaster that presents when fires occur. The environmental footprint is enormous. We have a solution, but because of government red tape my community cannot further that investment opportunity that would create jobs in my community and resolve a major environmental issue. It’s proven.", "We can’t get an extension of a five-year permit so that these people, who have invested millions of dollars within my community—we can’t get a permit so that they can just simply show this plant to potential investors. They need to be able to run it for 12 hours a month. Nobody is going to spend millions of dollars to purchase this technology and then operate a plant like this if they can’t see it happen. They want to be able to watch a tire move across that belt, go through the ovens, get reduced, and they want to see that carbon black at the end. They’re not going to be able to do that if we can’t get a permit to operate for 12 hours.", "The Minister of the Environment has said, “No, you can’t get that permit unless you apply for a permanent permit.” It doesn’t make any sense. These are the types of things that are stifling our ability to grow jobs. It is stifling our opportunity to improve the environment—red tape. It would be nice if we were in this House speaking about actual initiatives that advance reducing our carbon footprint, actual initiatives that will make a difference, not just simply speaking about identifying a problem that we already know exists.", "I spoke yesterday about the ferrochrome processing plant that Noront Resources wants to build in northern Ontario. This plant will create, just to build it, about 400 jobs; to operate it, about another 400 jobs; and an indirect spinoff of approximately 3 to 1, so potentially another 1,000 to 1,200 jobs within a community in northern Ontario. Sault Ste. Marie, Thunder Bay, Sudbury and Timmins have been asked to put proposals in.", "I’m sure the member from Thunder Bay–Superior North, the minister, would be very happy to see 400 jobs in his community, and another 1,200 potential, indirect jobs. I know my community would be very, very happy to have those. I know Sudbury would be very happy, and I know Timmins would be very happy to see those jobs, but we’re not going to be able to do it if we can’t get the Ring of Fire development done. They can operate in an environmentally safe and responsible way. Those opportunities exist right within the north, to be able to grow jobs and still have it done in a safe and responsible way.", "Let’s imagine that Noront cannot develop the proper infrastructure. Well, they will still mine the resources, and those resources will be shipped off to China or other locations, like in South Africa, where there’s a significant ferrochrome market. Those plants will turn that ore into ferrochrome and produce stainless steel. We will not see the benefits that those plants would provide to the environment if they operated within Ontario, within our environmental restrictions here in our province. If they are operating in some of these foreign markets where those restrictions do not apply, that carbon footprint is felt by the world. Whether you produce ferrochrome in Ontario or whether you make ferrochrome in India or China or South Africa, the carbon footprint is felt around the world. If we really want to do something to help the environment, let’s make sure that business is here in Ontario, so that at least we can control the carbon that is emitted from these places.", "What do they need? They need a road. They also need some help on energy rates. Let’s promise them that we’ll give them six cents a kilowatt hour. Let’s do something to incentivize these businesses to operate in Ontario, if we want to reduce their carbon footprint around the world. These are the types of the initiatives we can take.", "It’s unfortunate that we’re here spending valuable time discussing a motion with no teeth, no solutions, no plan, while we have important things to address, very important matters that matter to our economy and matter to the environment—" ],

This is a day in which the world stands together in support of a woman’s right to live free from violence. International Women’s Day is an important time to recognize the achievements and contributions of women. It is also a time to reflect on the work that still must be done.", "The theme for this year’s International Women’s Day is “Press for Progress.” This is a call to action for all of us to press forward and continue to lead change. Our government continues to press for progress. Our government is committed to ending gender violence and to improving gender equality. We want all women, and everyone who identifies as a woman, to benefit from a more fair and equal society.", "Over the past few weeks, our government pressed for progress by launching two major new strategies: It’s Never Okay: Ontario’s Gender-Based Violence Strategy; and Then Now Next: Ontario’s Strategy for Women’s Economic Empowerment. These investments will have a significant impact going forward on the lives of women and girls across the province. They are a response to the voices of the many women and girls who have come forward to press for progress in Ontario and around the world this past year.", "Speaker, we are in a moment. Our government has seen women marching in the streets for change. We have heard survivors of violence say #MeToo over and over again. We have travelled throughout Ontario and spoken with agencies and people with lived experience of violence. We have been so grateful for their guidance. We have heard the stories of women who continue to live in dangerous situations because they can’t find safety. We know that women are waiting to receive counselling services or struggling to get through the legal system. We have been listening, and we have taken action.", "We have announced It’s Never Okay: Ontario’s Gender-Based Violence Strategy. It’s an up-to-$242-million commitment to ending all forms of violence against anyone based on their gender, gender expression or gender identity. As a result, there will be more services and better supports for survivors. For example, up to 1,000 more women and children will have a safe bed when escaping violence. As well, the sexual assault centre system will receive up to a 35% overall base-funding increase. This will add 90,000 hours of counselling coverage for rural and remote communities and services to male survivors. We will also provide more help for kids and families to end the cycle of violence, with more programming for children and youth in shelters. We’re increasing base funding for the Family Court Support Worker Program by up to 148%, because family breakdowns are when violence is most likely to occur.", "We want to change minds and challenge attitudes about violence and improve the justice system’s response. As one example, Ontario is going to pilot Canada’s first-ever LGBTQ+ community legal clinic. We will also build up the Partner Assault Response Program to help offenders take responsibility and break the cycle of violence. We are creating a stronger system overall so survivors and families can get the support they need and so people can live free of violence and the threat of violence in this province.", "We also recognize that more needs to be done so that women can benefit equally in Ontario’s economy.", "There are still gender biases that influence people’s views about what career paths women should choose, or how their work is valued. We know that, measured by annual wages for all workers, women earn 30% less than men. And we know that women are significantly under-represented in leadership positions. A recent report says that by addressing gender inequalities in the labour market, Ontario could add about $60 billion to the province’s GDP within a decade.", "It’s time to close the gender wage gap, particularly where it is the greatest: for indigenous, newcomer and racialized women, and those with disabilities.", "It’s time for women’s economic empowerment, because it’s fair and it means a stronger, more inclusive economy.", "Just two days ago, I, along with the Minister of Labour, Kevin Flynn, and our Premier, Kathleen Wynne, announced Then Now Next: Ontario’s Strategy for Women’s Economic Empowerment. This strategy lays out a three-year plan to increase gender equity, challenge bias and eliminate barriers that women face at work, at home and in their communities. These are the same barriers that prevent women from benefiting equally in the economy. The strategy is the first of its kind in Canada.", "Our government will be taking action in a number of areas. First, we’ll be uncovering and closing pay gaps by tackling the gender wage gap through pay transparency. Just this week, my colleague Minister Flynn introduced historic legislation that will set the stage to require employers to disclose employee pay based on gender and other characteristics, and to improve pay transparency at hiring, which will empower women to bargain at a fair wage. We’ll also strengthen Ontario’s Pay Equity Office to improve compliance.", "In addition, Then Now Next: Ontario’s Strategy for Women’s Economic Empowerment will expand and strengthen women’s centres. These centres provide low-barrier wraparound supports to women rebuilding their lives, including those experiencing violence, as well as immigrant and racialized women.", "We are encouraging more women on boards by leveraging government buying power to encourage large firms to reach the target of 30% women on private sector boards.", "We are removing barriers to indigenous women’s leadership through targeted programming developed with our indigenous partners.", "And we’re establishing the Ontario Women’s Entrepreneurship Association.", "Speaker, these actions, and much more under the new strategy, will help create a province where women can succeed on any path that they choose.", "Our government is positioning itself as a leader in Canada that is investing in women’s futures at all economic levels. Our government, led by Ontario’s first female Premier, Kathleen Wynne, is leading change. Our cabinet is now made up of 47% women.", "I believe that having more women in positions of influence, not just in government but in all areas of life, is changing the future.

I want to thank all those who will be involved in the discussion.", "I thought I’d bring a little bit of a background with regard to the special purpose account. The account was created back in the 1990s by the Progressive Conservatives and the member from Timmins–James Bay, who is here and who was here at that time. At that time, it was deemed that the licensing structure that had been created for hunters and anglers, the royalties from commercial fishermen and the fines that are given out for issues resulting from not following the regulations—that money would be pooled together in a special purpose account and be solely used to reinvest into the management of fish and wildlife resources, so it was resource management. Also, there was a council that was available at the time to help make decisions, a heritage council, as to how that money was spent.", "It was back in 2011, when I was elected, seven years ago, that a local group, the Aylmer District Stakeholder Committee, came with a problem, with an issue. Just to put into context this Aylmer District Stakeholder Committee—it’s not just a group of people who love to hunt and fish, which it is, but it’s also an organization that was created by this Liberal government back in 2003, I believe, when David Ramsay was the minister of the MNR. He had organized this stakeholder group to help them manage the resources in units 92, 93, and 91, I believe—but anyway, the southwestern Ontario area. They had great success. They actually created this system where, through a project, they were helping warn cars from going up and down our busy highways—they’re not as busy as in Toronto—with warning lights for areas where the deer normally cross, so that people knew during times of the year when the light was flashing that it was time to be watching out for the deer. It’s quite an effective program.", "This group had great success with Donna Cansfield. They think she was one of the best MNR ministers they ever had to deal with. I thought I’d share that with you, just so you don’t think that this group is not really knowing what they’re doing or that they’re partisan. They’re far from partisan. Their heart is in fishing and wildlife management in this province.", "On that committee, there are two previous managers of hunting and angling for the MNR. We have MNR biologists and local farmers and hunters in that group. It’s a well-educated group.", "That’s why this bill has come to fruition.", "I’ve been a member of the Legislature for seven years. I’ve had five different MNR ministers to deal with. I keep bringing up this question because we don’t get the answers.", "The issue is, this group had gone to the minister to seek some funding to do a deer study. They work with the local MNR to decide how many deer tags they’re giving out each year so they can maintain the population. They wanted $10,000 to do a study. There were told there was no money for that project. They said, “Holy smokes. How much of that SPA money was spent? Where in our region was it spent?” They said, “We don’t have that detail.”", "In my area, we have 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 hunters through the season. We have wild turkey and deer. They come and buy their licences and their tags.", "They’re saying, “Out of all that money that’s generated in our area, we can’t get the money back to study the resource that’s generating that money.”", "We continued to push the issue. The first minister said, “I’ll get back to you,” and never got back to me. I get it. The other ministers—I got zero answers.", "The Aylmer district stakeholders did a freedom-of-information request. The MNR told the Information and Privacy—wherever that goes through—that records don’t exist for that detail of how the money was spent. They said, “That can’t be true. There has to be something.” So they did it again. Luckily, we were able to get a little bit of information. When they received the information, I thought, “Great. There’s detail. You can see where the money was spent.” They went through it, and they gave me a copy of it. It really raised some flags. I’ll just highlight some of the issues:", "—$500,000 spent on accommodations;", "—$300,000 spent on meals;", "—$4,000 spent on media;", "—purchase of home, $53,000;", "—psychologists, $12,000;", "—housekeeping services, $15,000;", "—personal household goods, $154,000;", "—meals, $96,000;", "—tuition, $1,700;", "—hospitality, $15,000;", "—cleaning service, $29,000;", "—laundry services, $14—they even billed laundry services for $14;", "—stationery and office supplies, $147;", "—bedding and linen, $7,660.", "There has to be an explanation.

They’re the ones who make sure that our forests are in good shape. They take care of the land that they’re on. It’s not like northern Ontario; northern Ontario is crown property that you can go hunting on. In southwestern Ontario, the people don’t realize that we don’t have a lot of crown land—very little, in fact. It’s all privately owned land. So not only are they hunting on land, but the farmers themselves have to maintain that property, with their own money and such, to keep the wildlife going. If they spill extra grain or corn during harvest season, they’re okay with that, because they know it’s going to be feeding the deer and the wild turkeys. They make sure things are kept in place. Not only are they doing that; they’re paying their fees. They expect their fees to go to support wildlife resource management. So that’s why my group said they wanted the study: because they’re the ones—the MNR—who decide how many deer tags to give out, how many deer can be harvested that year.", "Then, other things started happening. Hunters couldn’t get access to their tags to actually go hunting. They bought their hunting licence, then they went into the draw to get their tags, and all of a sudden they weren’t getting their tags. They can get that for maybe a year, and then they’re supposed to get rotated, but there’s something wrong with the program, and unfortunately they’re still paying in their money. They’re okay with paying that money and maybe missing having the ability to hunt that year, except when they realize that the money they’re paying into is going for cleaning services, psychologists and steak dinners.", "What else has happened? Well, the Thames River used to be open to walleye fishing in the spring. In 2008, the government shut it down, saying, “We want to do a study for two years. For two years, we’ll do a study, and then we’ll reopen it.” It’s still closed today. They haven’t done the study. Well, that’s what the SPA money is for, if you need the money to do the spending. That’s what those anglers buying their licences expected: Use the SPA money, do some research while this walleye fishing is shut down, and reopen it. It’s a great economic booster for our area.", "Moose hunting: Guys in the north realize it—a lot of moose hunters in my area. This government has destroyed moose hunting in this province, and we don’t understand why. They’re collecting hunting and fishing licences for resource management, but they never manage the resource—the moose. We found out years ago that for the aerial count that they used to do for moose, they cut corners, or they didn’t do it as often or it got cancelled. They weren’t using the money for the right thing.", "Then this government, two years ago, added a user fee onto the deer and hunting licences, but that didn’t go to the SPA fund. Who knows where that money went? So now we’ve got the hunters and anglers throughout this province paying more, because the fees go up all the time. Now they have a fee. Now they’re paying HST on that fee. They’re not getting the access to hunt and fish in this province, and now they have reports showing that the money is not being spent as it should be spent: on managing fish and wildlife. They’re paying more and getting less.", "With regard to the heritage committee, I know the government mentioned that we already have a committee. I’ve got members in my riding who are part of that committee. They had no say. The ministry didn’t listen to anything they said. They were there just to rubber-stamp. This is why I’ve included this council in my piece of legislation: to actually have some say in the proper management of our fish and wildlife.", "Two things were a shock today. I had a quick email from the OFAH that I saw. They’re worried that this fund will be cancelled if they kick up a stink. I’ve never said that. I’ve never heard the third party say that. I really haven’t even heard the government say they’d ever cancel it, so I don’t know why, if we actually question the transparency and accountability of this fund, they’d be afraid it would be cancelled, unless they’re hearing something else from the other side. I hope there haven’t been threats to the OFAH that they will lose this funding, because there’s no reason why they should ever lose this funding, considering it is licence fees.", "Second of all, the response from the minister today was quite convincing to me that this government, over its 15 years, has officially downloaded the running of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to our hunters and anglers of this province. She has said that it’s to pay their benefits—to pay to have the staff on the ground. Well, that is not the reasoning of the SPA fund. Those staff, those COs, those biologists and all those people were there prior to the special purpose account being created. They should be there today. That money is needed to be used for projects to keep resources managed. It should not be used to maintain the ministry staff. That is wrong. We all pay taxes in this province, and the tax money in the general revenue should be paying for the staff, day in and day out. The extra funding from the SPA fund from the hunters and anglers of this province does not need to be going to actually running the ministry.", "You’ve lost that over the years. I don’t know where you went wrong, but you owe the hunters and anglers an apology. We need to add this transparency. Support my legislation. We’ll know how the money is spent and where the money is spent. There will be a council of grassroots hunters and anglers telling you how to spend the money, and there will be a way for the people of this province to question the spending of this government and get the answers that they deserve, which we’ve been shut out of." ],

We think that’s a good thing.", "But I have to start this debate by saying that I remember in 1997 when Mike Harris decided to introduce legislation that was supposedly going to make sure that all of the dollars that we collect from the sale of licences for hunting and fishing or fines and all that stuff would be used to make sure we do restocking and that we do proper work when it comes to managing those biosystems.", "Remember how, with Mike Harris, the mantra was “Promise made, promise kept”? Well, this was promise made but not quite kept, because clearly when they drafted the legislation, they made it possible for it not to be transparent. It’s interesting that a Conservative member comes by today and says, “Well, promise made, and maybe I should try to keep it 20 years later.” But I’m with you. I think 20 years or two years, it’s never too late. I think that transparency on these particular types of expenditures is important.", "I think you touched the nail on the head, which is that anglers and hunters and utilizers of the forest are not interested in seeing bad management of the system. They want to make sure that whatever happens when it comes to harvesting, either fishing or hunting or any other activity in the bush, we do that in a responsible way, that we make sure that in the future there are fish and wildlife there for everybody to be able to benefit from, whether for ecotourism or for hunting and fishing.", "The member is quite right to say that a lot of anglers and hunters and those who utilize the forests, as well as in ecotourism, are somewhat upset that, quite frankly, these dollars aren’t being used for what they are intended for. I think that’s a very fair point that the member is raising: that we should, in fact, make sure that all of those dollars raised are used as they were intended.", "I remember at the time this bill was brought in, in 1997, I made the point in the debate back then. As I read the legislation, I said, “Listen, this is one of these things where the government is saying all the right things but in the end the government is going to be able to utilize the money for other things.” We were told, “No, no, no. You don’t know.” I think it was Mr. Snobelen who was the Minister of Natural Resources at the time when this was done. I’d have to go back and check, but I’m pretty sure it was him. But that we’re doing it now is a good thing.", "Because we’re talking about MNR, I just want to put a couple of things on the record very quickly, and you kind of touched on them.", "More and more, we are downloading our responsibilities within MNR. This hasn’t just started with this minister; this has been going on for a while. We’ve been downloading more and more responsibilities onto the forestry sector, onto the mining sector, onto anglers and hunters, you name it. The MNR is a shell of what it used to be. I’m sure that if I was minister today, as the minister herself is not exactly happy with the limitation of her ministry as it tries to do what it is mandated to do by legislation—because we have the Public Lands Act, we have the sustainable forestry development act, we have all kinds of legislation that says the ministry has to do all of these things, and the ministry doesn’t have the capacity to do them in many cases.", "One of those places is cottage lot development. I’m going to put it in this debate because it’s the only time I can actually reference it, because we’re talking about this particular act. We have not developed a cottage lot on crown land in years. In fact, I think the last time they were done was when I was first elected in the early 1990s. What’s happened is that government after government, because they were trying to save money, did not give the MNR the money they needed in order to do cottage lot developments. We have all across northern Ontario—as you probably have in your area, but in your cases it’s mostly private land. Where we come from, if you want to build a cottage, it ain’t private land; it’s crown land. You cannot get a permit in order to build a cottage on crown land in northern Ontario. You can’t even get a land use permit in northern Ontario, as we all know, and it’s a real problem.", "One of the things that is important to me as a northerner—and I know as New Democrats we’ve talked about this before—is that we need to be able to make sure that we go back to a system where we do lake studies and we do the work that needs to be done to make sure that whatever we bring online for sale is sustainable to the environment, but in fact we get into the business of making sure that people are able to buy cottage lots so they can then build cottages in areas they’d like to. It helps the local economy. Everybody from the guy who sells the Ski-Doo to the woman who sells the boat to the real estate agent to the lumber mill to the grocery store to the fishing bait shop—everybody benefits from it. I would just put that on the record.", "I know that my colleagues would like to say something so I’m going to wrap it up right now." ],

All of the funds are being dedicated. That’s why this special fund exists, and that’s why it continues to be done. It has been accounted for. Treasury Board has guidelines on it and it has continued to be done.", "I want to talk a little bit about what it does, because I think there may have been some misunderstanding about what it does and why it is that it has continued to be helpful to the province of Ontario and to anglers and hunters throughout.", "I was a little puzzled by the wording of the bill when I read it, because the bill amends section 85 of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to remove one clause and to remove the possibility of the fish and wildlife special purpose account to be used for the payment “for a matter related to the activities of people as they interact with or affect wildlife or fish populations, including any matter related to safety.”", "I don’t think we should remove from the act the possibility of supporting programs for the safety of hunters, for the safety of anglers, and also one of the programs that I’ll talk about—which has been a real success—which is Learn to Fish. It’s a program that leads to teaching people how to fish safely and in a sustainable manner. That’s an important program and it would not be here, it would not be available to people if the fund did not exist.", "I’m trying to understand where the member is coming from. I assume he does not object to some of the things that have been paid for by the fund: the Learn to Fish program and the stocking of fish throughout Ontario. It’s been a great priority of this fund to continue to ensure that there are fish in our lakes.", "I think it is also important that we have conservation officers enforcing our laws to ensure that we don’t overfish and overhunt, and that the system is fair to everyone. That has been part of the priorities as well.", "It also funds public education development, and that is also a good thing, because I think that is what is helping us maintain biodiversity and ensuring that everybody is able to continue to have access to the bounty of our land: the fish and the wildlife. It also allows—and this is important—for research and monitoring to be done.", "Part of the issue is whether all programs are being funded. No, not all programs are being funded. I understand that initially the deer monitoring program was not funded because there was not enough money. But let me reassure you, research and monitoring continue to be done. It’s crucial. We will not be able to manage our fisheries or our wildlife unless we continue to do good research.", "I understand that the member does not really object to this, but I think he objects to the fact that people who are doing this work are employees of the government and that they have benefits; indeed, they have access to health care and they have access to the possibility of accessing a psychologist, if they need to. That’s part of their benefit package. We’ve spent the last week talking about our commitment to health care and mental health. Surely, we’re not going to say that the employees at MNRF are not entitled to have access to mental health.", "I understand the concern, that we want the fund to be used to support wildlife and fisheries. It is, but the commitment of the ministry is much wider than just this fund to support wildlife and fisheries.", "I want to quote the same gentleman I quoted this morning, Angelo Lombardo, the executive director of the anglers and hunters, who in August 2017 said the following: “When media reports of MNRF’s misspending broke last fall, the fishing and hunting community was quick to assume that we were right in the middle of the next big government scandal. Fortunately, it quickly became clear that that was nowhere near reality and those who raised concerns about how our licence dollars are being spent were playing fast and loose with the truth.”", "Indeed, he is the one who continues to say that MNRF continues to do the good work that needs to be done. He’s the one who mentions, “We cannot grow and stock fish without people. We can’t do assessments or surveys without people.” I think it’s important that we recognize that the biologists of MNRF are important to continuing this work. It’s conservation officers, biologists, scientists and technicians who could be paid through this.", "He concludes by saying, “The unintended unfortunate consequence of the-sky-is-falling headlines that continue to surface is that it brings unwarranted negative attention to a good thing.”", "That’s a little bit of what I want to say here, which is that this fund is a good thing. I know the member has concerns about the governance of it. I looked into this. I have another quote here from the chair of the Fish and Wildlife Heritage Commission, Kathy Reid. She complained to us. She’s worried about this private member’s bill, and says, “Since 2002, the Fish and Wildlife Heritage Commission has provided invaluable feedback and recommendations to the Minister of Natural Resources on a variety of hunting and fishing issues, including hunter education, youth engagement and the famous fund expenditures.", "“By proposing to introduce a new stakeholder advisory group”—which actually duplicates the work that they’re doing—“the member’s private member’s bill fundamentally ignores and discredits the important perspective of the commission and the stakeholders that this member represents”—and I want to take the opportunity to thank them for the great work they are doing for it.", "I want to reassure the member—and my time is coming up, but I want to share it with other members. The money is being spent on wildlife and fisheries. I agree, and I can guarantee you that we want to publicize this work better. Certainly if there was a miscommunication of non-access to the proper information, I would be quite happy to commit today to ensuring that the proper information on how the fund is spent will be made available to the public.

He has asked questions, introduced petitions and raised this issue in debate.", "Unfortunately, transparency does not seem to be high in the priorities of this government. The money in this special purpose account comes from Ontario anglers and hunters and is supposed to be spent to maintain healthy wildlife populations and to promote angling and hunting opportunities in Ontario, and that is all. It’s some $60 million each year. The annual report is supposed to show how that money is spent.", "Let’s look at the annual report. It has lots of graphics, but very little detail. Only when a local group from the member’s riding made a freedom-of-information request were they really able to find out what the money was spent on. As my colleague from Elgin–Middlesex–London has pointed out, it wasn’t all spent on maintaining a healthy wildlife population. He went into some of the details of things that are pretty far removed from trying to manage fish and wildlife populations.", "Part of the problem—and I think the member from Timmins–James Bay talked about that—is that the core funding of the ministry over the past number of years has been flatlined. Essentially, the MNRF has been starved the last number of years. I think they’ve had to look for money just to try to keep the doors open and keep things going, and it may very well be that money is coming from the special purpose account for core operations in the ministry that it really shouldn’t be getting used for.", "I do want to talk about a few other issues within the Ministry of Natural Resources that money could be spent on; for example, wolves and caribou. There’s one thing the money could have legitimately been used for, and that would have been to remove the wolves from Michipicoten Island before they decimated the island’s caribou herd. The wolves got onto the island in 2014 when the ice allowed them to cross from the mainland. Since then, the caribou population on the island went from about 450 animals to as few as 30. Just this winter, the few remaining caribou were removed from the island. It seems to me that it would have made much more sense just to take the wolves back where they came from, because now the wolves will have to find other prey on the island.", "On the topic of wolves, another proposed idea right now in the ministry is the ban on hunting wolves and coyotes—the big expansion on the ban on the hunting of wolves and coyotes. We’ve all heard reports of coyotes in the city of Toronto, so I can’t believe they are in any way under threat, but they’ve been included in the proposed ban. The Ontario Fur Managers Federation wrote to the ministry asking for the science behind this proposal, and suggested that in this case more research needs to be done both into the consequences of this ban and into whether the Algonquin wolf is indeed a native species or a hybrid species. I think that’s rather critical. I want to quote from their submission to the ministry: “We believe that more research needs to be carried out on the evolution of hybrids and what changes the protection will have on our current ecosystem.”", "I’m not a biologist, but I would hope that the ministry would make their science public to answer these concerns. This government has a habit of acting without considering the unintended consequences of their actions. In this case, the unintended consequences might well be a dramatic decrease in deer population. If there are more wolves, they will need more food. That will impact the deer population, the moose population, the beaver population. Has the government considered what more wolves are going to mean to these species—and what about to the people in ridings like mine who depend on hunting deer and moose to feed their families through the winter? More wolves and coyotes are also going to mean more losses for farmers, again, because the wolves and coyotes will need more food.", "If the MNRF has solid science to prove the need for this ban and studies into how such a ban would impact other species, they should share that science. Unfortunately, in my experience, this government is more likely to make decisions based on what an environmental lobby group says rather than based on science.", "I did want to talk a bit about the many challenges that are happening with wildlife rehabilitation centres in the province of Ontario, but I think that will have to wait for another time.", "I just want to congratulate the member on bringing this bill forward. I know it’s something that’s homegrown from his riding and that he has been very persistent on it. He has a dedicated group of volunteers who are really trying to do good work in the province. They want to see that $60 million a year that comes from hunting and fishing licences go back into supporting the management of the wildlife in the province of Ontario. I think he should be commended for bringing this bill forward." ],

Because we have had some historical cutbacks within the MNR.", "When I’m in the bush and walking a trail, doing some partridge hunting with my dog, Abby—a great dog, beautiful dog—my sons and I meet up with a game warden out there—he’s walking—and we get into a discussion about him not having the proper ability to put enough gas into his four-wheeler in order to do the inspections that we need. That’s the kind of stuff that the MNR needs to talk about and really focus on.", "When I go into classrooms, and the Gore Bay Fish and Game Club—get to know them, Minister, because they’re fantastic. The C.C. McLean classroom students, grades 3 and 4, have been raising chinook fish in their classrooms. I think that this year, they’re going to be on their third year. They’re hatching and they’re fertilizing this year. This is a new part of their program, as far as what they’re doing. It’s amazing, how you can see these children come to life, because that’s exactly what they’re doing.", "I’m glad our agriculture critic, the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane, is here.", "Like agriculture, when you grow food, you have an ownership into it. These kids have an ownership into these fish. They like to see them in their streams, and they like to go out and watch them.", "Also, they do a lot of interaction with the tourism that comes in as well. “Oh, you caught my fish. You caught one of my fish.” This is connecting with these kids, because they’re coming back and they’re staying in their communities.", "Another person I want to give a shout-out to, who has educated me quite a bit in regard to fish hatcheries, is Rolly Frappier. Rolly Frappier worked very closely with a young childhood friend of mine who is now the chief of Mattagami First Nation. They have opened up their fish hatchery. They’ve had to look outside of the MNR in order to do this. Why? It’s because we’ve had some larger pressures of fishers and anglers on the lakes, on Mattagami Lake and Minisinakwa River. They’ve developed, and they’ve engaged with their schools.", "It is amazing what you can do. It’s a great educational tool that the MNR could be involved with as well.", "I did want to say that I want to give you a shout-out, and I’m going to give you an update. By 6 o’clock tonight, I’m hoping to get a call in regard to a helicopter that is going to be leaving the airport. They’re going to be serving the Michipicoten Island to try and identify a last bull caribou in order to have it relocated over to Caribou Island. I’m hoping they’ll be able to do it. They’re going to be back. I’m expecting an update.", "Michipicoten: The previous member brought up an excellent point, which is, why did it get to a point where we looked at an entire population of caribou being exterminated from an island? A healthy population of 450: Why did we wait so long to take action? We knew the wolves were there; we knew. These are actual caribou, the real ones. You can see these ones, Speaker. They’re right there. It’s a beautiful area—opportunities to learn, opportunities for tourism, everything. But we watched it and sat idly by—a complete devastation.", "It’s only because pressures were put on by Michipicoten First Nation and a lot of advocates who were in that area. Again, Michipicoten First Nation took the lead and also helped financially. There are other organizations that have now come on board with the relocation program in order to assist.", "Why do we need other organizations to come in and assist financially? Isn’t the role of the MNR to manage our resources?", "I want to give a shout-out to Christian Schroeder, who lives on Michipicoten Island, who has been living with these caribou for a very long time, who is more than likely one of the experts on the issue; and also, Leo Lepiano, who is from Michipicoten First Nation, who has been working tirelessly on this along with Gord Eason, who is a retired MNR gentleman, who has been an advocate, trying to get this done.", "I’m glad that we’re doing something; I’m glad that we did. Not only did we relocate caribou from Michipicoten Island to Caribou Island, but we also relocated others to the Slate Islands—a healthy population that we’re going to be bringing over.", "Actually, it’s how we started the new population that is on Michipicoten Island now. We relocated about seven or eight. You know what? An insurance policy is what we’re doing, to maybe reintroduce one day these caribou to Michipicoten Island. By the same token, on the Slate Islands, what we did is we took the steps to doing something. We relocated some caribou to that location, but we only relocated one bull—big concern. Everybody knows that there are some inbreeding problems and concerns that might happen from there.", "It’s been three weeks to four weeks now that we’ve been fighting to get that last bull moved over. At the last hour, I’m glad we’re going to do it. We’re taking the steps to do it now. We’re putting the money—this money—as to what the MNR is supposed to do in order to relocate them, but I am concerned we might be too late. So is Michipicoten. They are out there, and I’m hoping I’m going to get a call by 6 o’clock saying, “We’ve relocated an extra bull. We’ll be able to have a healthy population and give them the opportunity to survive in order to thrive and reintroduce them to Michipicoten Island.”", "When you look at all of this, this is what you should be focusing on, Minister.

They want to be engaged in the programs but we’re not funding them, because they want to count deer and it’s not perceived as a priority for our ministry in this region to go and count deer, because the deer stocks are healthy. So the member, quite rightly, is supporting his group, but he has also signalled that he wants to politically interfere with funding decisions at the ministerial level. That in itself is just wrong. You have to take a step back on that. You do not interfere with government. You can advocate for your community, but you don’t now politically interfere with scientists who are spending scarce taxpayer dollars in order to get your way.", "Speaker, you heard very clearly from the minister. I appreciate the notion of transparency. It’s a very important criterion for our government. We brought in the transparency protection act. If the MPP is not getting, in a transparent and quick way, access to estimates—and not just at the end of the year when they come forward.

The idea of this account was to pool together all revenues from hunting and fishing licences and then put 100% back into wildlife management, in an effort to improve hunting and angling across the province. Sadly, the 100% has not happened, Madam Speaker, and still isn’t happening.", "This account, worth over $70 million a year, was to be spent only on resource management: projects like fish habitat restoration that we need in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound and across many Great Lakes communities and northern Ontario. Sadly, the government appears to have ransacked the special purpose account money on personal perks, allowing it to be spent on real estate fees for a homebuyer, moving expenses, rental accommodations and even paying for therapy sessions with psychologists. A report from 2011-12 shows that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry spent $69,000 of this money to buy and sell a house, and another $55,000 on psychologists and other medical services.", "As I’m sure all of you are asking by now, or should be, what does buying a home and paying almost $14,000 in home moving expenses have to do with fish and wildlife conservation? There’s a $9,000 expense for doctors’ appointments, and another $39,604 in other medical services. There’s $165,000 for hospitality expenses, suggesting the ministry knows how to throw a big party, and $6.5 million in non-consulting fees.", "Other spending anomalies include $172,000 for car accessories, while only $160,000 was spent on cars themselves. I don’t know how the ministry managed to spend more money on accessories than they did on the actual vehicles, but I invite the minister to show us how that looks. It’s clear that none of these items are for the fund’s intended purpose: to improve angling and hunting in Ontario.", "The member from Beaches–East York was just talking about benefits, Madam Speaker. I think I want to allude back to my colleagues, who have said that the core funding should be there. If this government wasn’t wasting so many billions of dollars, core funding like benefits would be there for all of the employees. It shouldn’t be put on the backs of the anglers and hunters who want to sustain and ensure that that fishery or that hunting opportunity is there.", "The downloading of core responsibilities: I know that in my riding, many of the hunters, fishers and anglers have said to me for many years, “Where are all the conservation officers”—people like Joel Tost and Billy Grieves, who were great conservation officers in the Bruce Peninsula. There are less of them today. Again, back to that core downloading: They’ve been doing that and putting it on their backs, and those core conservation officers are not nearly as plentiful as they used to be. They were there to truly be working with the conservation groups, anglers and hunters.", "And yet when a conservation group applied for a $10,000 grant for a wildlife project, the government told them no. There was no money left in that $70-million-a-year fund, because the government used it for all kinds of other purposes.", "Because of this wasteful and scandalous spending, my colleague is proposing that we amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to restrict the purposes for which the minister may pay out money from the ministry’s special purpose account. It also requires the minister to establish an advisory committee to advise on the operation of the separate account, and a procedure for receiving complaints from members of the public about decisions that the minister makes for payments made out of the separate account. In her opening statement, the minister said that she’s all for transparency, so I hope she would be supporting something like that, supporting that openness, transparency and accountability.", "I am very deeply troubled about the waste and mismanagement at the ministry, while hunters and anglers are facing increased fees and while local conservation clubs continue to go without the needed funds for important local fisheries and wildlife projects. I recently met with ministry officials to voice some of these concerns and remind them of the good work being done by the sportsmen in my riding, including the Bruce Peninsula Sportsmen’s Association, the Sydenham Sportsmen’s Association and the Hepworth Anglers Club on Spring Creek, which runs across my cousin Paul Walker’s property. I thank the minister’s staff for doing that brief.", "The Bruce Peninsula sportsmen, for example, have stocked more than five million rainbow trout, raise 500,000 salmonids each year, and build and maintain hundreds of eastern bluebird nesting boxes. I was just there on Family Day and walked through their clubhouse, and saw the many yearlings that they’re raising. These folks—Gordie Smith and Ray Marklevitz are two of the guys I know from that club; they have put in over 40 years of their lives on a voluntary basis to do that. I can tell you that they’re furious when they hear people stand up and talk about things like the expenses that have nothing to do with conservation. And then they go and try to get a little bit of money to continue that operation and continue to build the fishery and they get noes from the ministry.", "The Salmon Spectacular in Owen Sound is an event that was established and hosted by the Sydenham Sportsmen’s Association. People like Fred Geberdt, Chris Geberdt, Jack Doherty and Arnie Clark have been there for many, many years, doing great work.", "Ray Reidel and Reg Kreuger—back to the Bruce Peninsula Sportsmen’s Association—and president Jim Martell: These people invest thousands and thousands of hours of time over the years in these things, and they’re there for the true benefit of the actual conservation movement. They want to have fish and wildlife there for their kids and grandkids to enjoy. It’s very frustrating.", "My colleague I commend again, that he’s actually putting this in front of people. “You want to talk transparency?” he’s asking the minister. “Where are the numbers? Show me the absolute, to-the-penny accounting and justify how these are true expenditures.”", "Why isn’t the government supporting these wildlife and conservation efforts? Why is this important conservation work being left to fundraising, while the ministry wastes money on other things that are perks that they want to stand and rationalize rather than working with us to say, “You’re right. This should be a core, fundamental issue of the government.”", "I absolutely support Bill 204, which aims to guarantee that anglers’ and hunters’ fees go for their intended purpose: to improve angling and hunting in Ontario. I believe Bill 204 will stop this government from continuing to use this account as a personal slush fund or cash grab and putting it into other areas of spending. What they have done is, frankly, disrespectful to the hunters and anglers in Bruce-Grey and all across Ontario. It’s time for transparency and a guarantee that the service fees will be put back into conservation.", "I want to again commend my colleague Jeff Yurek from Elgin–Middlesex–London.

You can bend anything around safety to spend money foolishly like you have on that side of the House.

Many times these students end up in the judicial system or as a responsibility of the rest of the citizens of Ontario.", "In circumstances where the school is unable to resolve habitual absenteeism, it would be beneficial to the child for the children’s aid society to investigate the situation. Improving communication between education workers and child protection workers would put the best interests of the child at the forefront and increase the likelihood of better outcomes for these children and their families.", "Ontario is a province with a world-class education system in which all children are equally entitled to participate. However, when a child is unable to properly access education for reasons that may be outside of their control, they are at risk of dropping out and being denied a chance at future success.", "We know that when a child is the subject of receiving services through the child protection system, intervention at the earliest opportunity puts the child’s welfare at the centre and could identify the dysfunction, provide help to the family and promote better outcomes for the child’s future.", "In preparation for this bill, I had the opportunity to consult and collaborate with fellow elementary school teachers, school board officials, youth probation workers, a victim services expert, my local police chief and a very experienced children’s lawyer, who were all supportive of this bill. In fact, a petition was circulated which in less than a month was signed by over 450 members of these professions from my community alone.", "Speaker, we’re not talking about a few absences here and there, or ones with a valid excuse under section 21 of the Education Act, such as medical leave or for mental health reasons. We’re talking about cases where a child has been absent 40, 50, 60 or even more days in a year. And yes, I have seen this first-hand many times.", "Currently, the Education Act provides limited options on how to deal with cases of habitual absenteeism. Usually the first step would involve the teacher or principal contacting the family to raise the issue. But if it continues, the principal is required to report these cases to a board official, typically an attendance counsellor, if available. Attendance counsellors may arrange further meetings with the parents, but if this fails to improve attendance, they are left with only one enforcement option: Attendance counsellors can bring the parents to court, where they will face a fine of not more than $200. This seldom happens and does nothing to rectify the underlying issue for why the student has been consistently absent.", "In practice, this is far from sufficient, for several reasons. First and foremost, my experience and conversations tell me that attendance counsellors focus their efforts on grade 9 and 10 students, with a focus to keep these students from dropping out. Given that we all know early intervention is the key to resolving many of these issues, this age is far too late to make substantial change and seldom results in positive change. Secondly, the sheer hassle of going to court over a relatively small fine often leads to counsellors simply dropping the case.", "This is why we must make it clear that absenteeism, in its own right, is cause for concern. When school officials are unable to resolve the issue of absenteeism, this bill provides an alternate and, I believe, more effective course of action. Attendance counsellors are not social workers trained to deal with the root causes of absenteeism in many families and are not empowered to go into the home to investigate them. Children’s aid workers, however, are able to do this.", "This bill also creates a duty to report in the event that educators suspect that a student has been withdrawn from school for the explicit purpose of evading child protection workers. It is no secret that some parents or guardians are willing to go to great lengths to conceal their abuse. It is not uncommon for these parents to arrange for their child to change schools, school boards or even withdraw them completely to home-school them. The feeling among many school officials, who, to their credit, juggle many responsibilities, is that they are no longer in a position to intervene after a child has been removed from their supervision.", "For context, Speaker, it is worth noting that this idea is not a new one. With the help of the legislative research service, I learned that the 1927 Act for the Protection of Neglected and Dependent Children recognized absenteeism as a cause to consider a child neglected. For the next 57 years, every major piece of Ontario child protection policy recognized that a “child in need of protection” included “a child who without sufficient cause is habitually absent from home or school.”", "It was not until the Child and Family Services Act was introduced in 1984 under the Davis government that this was removed—and I respect Premier Davis very much. Bizarrely, a review of the debates and the committee meetings could find no explanation as to why this happened. It is time to right this decades-old mistake.", "However, it needs to be said that we are not only talking about extreme abuse that leads to issues of absenteeism. In my career, I encountered situations such as a mother who was going through a rough divorce and who found it very difficult to find the energy to make sure that her children got off to school in the morning, or parents who struggle to make ends meet, so they keep their children at home until the afternoon to spare them the embarrassment of not having a good lunch.", "This brings me to a very important point. By no means does this bill propose that habitual absenteeism should automatically lead to a child being taken from their home. The CYFSA specifically recognizes that “the least disruptive course of action that is available and is appropriate in a particular case to help a child, including the provision of prevention services, early intervention services and community support services, should be considered.”", "In cases where we can provide early intervention in a culturally sensitive manner, a little extra support and planning will often be what is needed to bring about change in families’ habits. I fully recognize that the majority of the time, removing a child or children from their parents’ custody is not in their best interests.", "That being said, in the province of Ontario, it is the law—I would repeat that; it is law—that a child over the age of six is required to attend school, and it is their parents’ responsibility to get them there. This requirement is not symbolic. It is our responsibility as a government to ensure that compliance with the law is upheld so that all students get the education they deserve so that they can be successful in life and productive students in this province.", "As the Minister of Children and Youth Services has said, “I believe that it is of utmost importance here in this Legislature as a government to do everything we possibly can to ensure that young people are at the heart of our decision-making.", "“Many children, youth and families in this province struggle with barriers that leave them struggling to thrive, and it’s our responsibility to break down those barriers to help ensure that our province’s youth can succeed.”", "Placing an emphasis on intervention will prevent more children from reaching crisis in the first place.", "Speaker, the child advocate lawyer who brought this issue to my attention and who has been a phenomenal advocate for this bill and an important resource provided the case of a 13-year-old who we will call Jay. Jay’s parents were separated, and he lived primarily with his mother. His father raised issues of possible neglect by his mother, including a lack of proper food and clothing and a lack of supervision. By the time Jay was in grade 8, he was averaging 47 absences per year and was late up to 84 times.", "The principal assessed that while Jay was very intelligent, there were major gaps in his education. While an attendance counsellor became involved when he entered high school, the mother failed to comply with his recommendations, and the counsellor was unable to access the home. At various points when attendance issues were raised, the mother would move or change schools. By the time CAS and the court system became involved in his situation, they had limited ability to assist Jay’s family.", "Jay is a textbook example of attendance issues being among the first signs of deeper problems that do not become clear until later in childhood. This is why chronic absenteeism itself must be considered a protection issue. Professionals who work with troubled children are in agreement that habitual absenteeism is a clear indicator of deeper issues. Teachers and other education workers make sure that these kids are cared for not just in the classroom. We feed them through breakfast clubs and lunch programs. We give them academic supports and support them through our school teams. If they are not at school, we can’t do any of these things, and that is when neglect can happen.", "It is important to recognize that addressing habitual absenteeism is not only good for the student, as they get the necessary help that they need, but it is good for their classmates and educators alike. When a student falls behind considerably, it becomes incredibly difficult for the teacher to bring them up to date on material that they need to know, and it takes away from the educator’s time for his fellow classmates.", "To conclude, I would like to emphasize that this bill does not enact any broad, new, sweeping powers, but rather solidifies existing laws to provide schools with the necessary authority to act as a last resort for assisting a child in need. In my opinion and those with whom I have consulted, a child who is held back from receiving education for reasons outside of their control is a victim of neglect and needs help to end this abuse. There is no greater tragedy than the loss of a child’s potential. It is our duty to help these children and to ensure that every child in Ontario has the opportunity to achieve their dreams.", "Thank you, Speaker. I look forward to debate on this bill." ],

I’ll be sharing my time with the member from Thornhill.", "Speaker, I’m sure that you would agree that ensuring the safety of children, one of the most vulnerable sectors of our community, is everyone’s responsibility. Within that context, I would like to acknowledge the member from Barrie’s advocacy on education, students and education workers. The member from Barrie recognizes, like the members of the Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus, the importance of protecting youth and children in Ontario’s education sector who are, or may be, at risk.", "However, as I review the measures in Bill 198, I look at it in the context also of section 72 of the Child and Family Services Act. School principals, teachers, early childhood educators and other designates are already bound by sections 72(1) and 72(2), which pertain to “Duty to report” and “Ongoing duty to report.” Within those provisions, it’s everyone’s duty to notify the local children’s aid society if you have even the slightest suspicion a child is being neglected or abused.", "It’s also important to mention that the duty to report—again, within those provisions—is ongoing. Even if you know a report has been made regarding a child, you must make a further report to the children’s aid society if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is, or may be, in need of protection.", "As proposed, Bill 198 allows designated education workers to contact the children’s aid society to investigate situations where a student is late or absent from school for a total of 40 days during a given school year.", "The current practice, as the member for Barrie properly pointed out, in all school boards is that the attendance counsellor, in consultation and collaboration—these are important distinctions—with the school principal, assesses the need to involve child protection services in cases of absenteeism and lateness. It’s unclear to me why the current approach, as I just stated, requires the level of intervention as laid out within the proposed legislation.", "While I appreciate the intent of Bill 198, there are some additional concerns that are supplementary to those that I’ve just cited.", "One is the proposed provision in Bill 198 that requires school principals, attendance counsellors or other designates to arrange a meeting with the parents of a child who reaches the 40-day absentee or lateness threshold before alerting a children’s aid society. As written, Bill 198 does not provide a description or definition regarding what constitutes an attempted meeting with the parents of a child. Without that level of clarity, an attempted meeting could be limited to a single phone call before a principal or counsellor could potentially involve the children’s aid society. This lack of clarity, in my view, does not give parents sufficient ability to address and resolve their child’s absenteeism or truancy.", "What’s clear in this discussion is that there’s a crucial and necessary trust relationship between home and school that this proposed bill would potentially affect if the school is seen as an agent of protective services, both by the immediate family and, potentially, the extended family.", "Lastly, as proposed, Bill 198 allows the Minister of Education to make regulations which, as of today, are not clearly laid out in the bill before us, beyond requiring school boards to notify a principal when a child’s absenteeism or truancy reaches the 40-day threshold for action.", "Second, the proposed bill, in my view, oversteps the judgment of education workers, who are best positioned to determine when to contact the children’s aid society, should they feel that a child is in need of protection.", "Education workers, like my daughter, are great at what they do—no doubt about that. These workers know the children they’re responsible for best, and are often able to determine well before a 40-day absence or lateness threshold whether a student may be in need of protection.", "As the official opposition critic for education and post-secondary education—and not unlike the member from Barrie—I’ve engaged with several stakeholder groups, associations and federations on this bill. A common thread through those ongoing consultations is the need to respect the judgment of teachers and administrators in the school.", "In closing, a good education is one of the most important tools we can give our children. The best way to do this is to ensure that our children attend school in a safe and positive learning environment.", "I believe that the intent and purpose of Bill 198 is already set out specifically within the legislative framework of section 72 of the Child and Family Services Act as well as in current practices in place in Ontario school boards.", "Thank you, Madam Speaker.

As a father and a grandparent myself, there’s absolutely nothing more important in this world to me than the safety of my children, my grandchildren and everybody’s children in the province of Ontario. When I think about them, I also think about the kids that are at school with them. It’s why I’m here. It’s why we fight for dignity in the workplace and for our environment—so they have a good world to live in when I am, unfortunately, gone.", "I do have some concerns around the bill. For those that don’t know, my daughter Chantel is a teacher in the Catholic school board. She teaches grades 5 and 6 in a very tough school, a very challenged school—a school where kids sometimes don’t come to school. My other daughter also works in the Catholic school board with special-needs kids. Sometimes it’s a real challenge getting kids to school—and their parents. My wife was a principal and a teacher for over 30 years. So I’ve had lots of discussion in my household around education and the value of a good education.", "I can tell you, going back a bit, before I get on to the bill, when I was just a little guy, it was a teacher that saw something in me. She didn’t report me to the children’s aid society. She took me under her wing and brought me an apple once in a while and brought me a sandwich once in a while. She used to drive me, when teachers used to do this—they don’t do it as much now because of some concerns with it—to my wrestling or hockey matches. That teacher saw something in me. That’s what should happen in our schools, and continues to happen every day with the breakfast clubs, which my colleague talked about.", "This bill might have good intentions, but I have some serious concerns around the consequences. It talks about flagging kids who are going to be late for school, or flagging that they could be experiencing abuse. The issue here is, think of a situation where kids are late for school. It happens in families where there are single parents, either moms or dads, in the changing makeup of our families today. It’s not because they’re bad parents or because they’re abusive, but because there’s a lot of difficulties that come from just being a single parent. It’s not hard to imagine, if you’re a single parent and you’re sick or your child is sick or your child has lost something—there’s a lot of reasons why they could be coming late to school.", "This becomes even worse if you’re a single parent that is struggling to find employment and taking a job wherever you can. Madam Speaker, I know this House hears me talk about good jobs a lot, but there is a distinction that needs to be made. We need to move people away from precarious work and into full-time, stable jobs, because those jobs have stable schedules and proper benefits and wages. Those are the kinds of jobs that people can raise a family on. But when a single mom or single dad is balancing two or three jobs, of course there’s going to be days where they fall behind the clock. I think we can all agree to that. It’s not because you’re abusive, but it may end up punishing them and that’s something that worries me.", "Madam Speaker, think about situations where kids can’t get to school on time because of transportation. Maybe they live somewhere in rural Ontario. Nobody in this House hasn’t heard us raise it 100 times about the problems that we’re having right here in Toronto about getting kids to school on time because of the bus situation that’s going on. And it doesn’t happen once; it’s happening almost daily.", "When I’m in my community, I can tell you, around the bus schedules, everywhere I go, bus drivers are coming up to me and saying, “We’ve got a problem. We can’t meet our schedules.” That’s happening all the time. So that’s another issue that I think is a real concern for me.", "Madam Speaker, we’ve sorted out the schooling issue in Niagara before. Now, in Fort Erie, we’ve been successfully working together with all levels of government. We’ve been able to build a school there. That means that students in Fort Erie will have the opportunity to get the best education possible. There is so much more that needs to be done to ensure that the school has the tools it needs to accommodate a growing student body and new programs, but working together, we’ve made strides from where we were.", "We have a different situation in Niagara-on-the-Lake. The school board there closed down the school in the heart of the old town. One of the reasons that residents fought against this was because of the distance the new school at Crossroads was from the people in the outlying area. That’s just one small example. In the north, this becomes an even bigger issue.", "What happens when rural families that are far from the school have issues with getting their kids to school on time? It happens all the time: two and three hours on a bus. It’s unfortunate, absolutely, but I’m not sure we should be penalizing them for it.", "Madam Speaker, I’ve only got 16 seconds left. I won’t be able to get through all this. Make no mistake about it: The safety of our kids and our grandkids is not something that we can ever afford to neglect, but there are ways we can support and protect them that don’t have a negative impact on low-income kids.

First off, I’m really thrilled to support the member from Barrie, Ann Hoggarth, who works incredibly hard. I’ve gotten to know Ann over the last three and a half or four years, and one of the things that I think people on this side will certainly agree to—and probably members opposite—is that this is a member who is incredibly passionate about issues around education, and also incredibly knowledgeable, as someone who has been a schoolteacher for many years. When I say passionate, I don’t just mean here in the Legislature when speaking about issues related to education, but in the halls and in the caucus room. She is constantly thinking about how we make our education system better and stronger. I’m thrilled to join her in working towards doing that. This is a great example of her putting her advocacy to paper and to legislation, which can help make that system even better.", "I wanted to share a brief story that I think is relevant to this piece of legislation. My family on my mother’s side, as I’ve mentioned in the past here in the chamber, migrated from eastern Europe to Canada. Like so many immigrants who come to this country, they came because they want the next generation and their grandchildren to live a better life than they did. My grandparents were no exception.", "As I was growing up, as I was in school, as I was a teenager, my grandfather would always say to me, “Yvan, I don’t care what you do in life. I don’t care what profession or what job you have. I really don’t even care what you choose to study in school. I just want to know you’re going to get good grades, and I want to know you’re going to graduate from university.” For him, that was it. When I graduated from my undergraduate degree, I remember my grandfather was there, and that was one of the proudest days of his life. The same goes for my sister when she graduated; that was such a special moment for him.", "For them, an education that positioned us to achieve our potential, to achieve our dreams, was the single most important thing. The reason I share that story is because I think that passion for education is something that a lot of Ontario families share, and they share that passion because they appreciate the importance of an education to their children’s and grandchildren’s futures.", "I gave the example of post-secondary education just now, but my grandparents were just as committed and just as passionate and insisted equally that I succeed in my high school education and my elementary school education. If you want to get a university degree or a college degree or an apprenticeship, or anything after you graduate from high school, you need to successfully complete your elementary, your middle school and your high school studies.", "I raise this story to highlight the fact that I think people across Ontario understand the importance of education, particularly in the labour market and the economy we find ourselves in today, and to do that, kids need to be in school. They need to be present. That’s why I really was eager to speak to the member from Barrie’s private member’s bill.", "What this is doing, to me, is underlining, first of all, an issue that’s very important, which is that if there are instances where a student is absent, and in this bill it’s over 40 days in a given year, then the member has proposed a series of steps that I think are reasonable to make sure that attention is given to that student by the school principal, by the counsellor, if there is one, or by other staff—teachers etc.—and to make sure steps are taken to do everything possible by the school system to help the student be present in school. In exceptional circumstances where all of those steps have failed—that involves communicating with the family, doing what can be helpful to help the student get back into school—only then does this issue get reported. I think this is a very reasonable proposal that we should be discussing and taking to committee.", "One of the members opposite raised a concern about what happens if the school bus is late or doesn’t show up or something like that. Again, I defer to the member from Barrie because she’s more knowledgeable than I am, but, to my knowledge, that’s not considered an absence on the record—" ],

If I missed two days, my family was very concerned. If I missed three days, it was strike three: “Yvan, what’s going on here?” Forty days is a lot and requires some sort of escalation, in my view, to make sure everything possible is done for the sake of the child. This is all about the child.", "I think the member has proposed something that’s very reasonable to help improve attendance at schools, to help get children and families the supports they need and ultimately help these children achieve what my grandparents wanted for me: Presence in school so that I could study and learn, so I could get good grades, so that I could pursue my dreams and achieve my potential. There’s no family in Ontario that doesn’t want that. There’s no family in Ontario that doesn’t deserve that.

We should be concerned about absenteeism, and we’re speaking about more than 40 days a year; we’re not speaking about students missing school one or two days a year.

I guess sometimes they get dropped off by the parents and picked up, and sometimes they go with one of their parents. It’s a big concern for the teachers and a big problem for the school. It’s not exactly what you would call chronic absenteeism, and I’m wondering if maybe the member wants to address that when she has her wrap-up time.", "There are a lot of parents who have challenges; they have complicated work schedules. There are children who do very competitive sports or are perhaps members of ACTRA; they get tutors. We’re quite aware of those kinds of situations, and I’m sure the member isn’t considering that to be chronic absenteeism.", "I spoke this week with the Minister of Children and Youth Services at the OACAS leadership convention that they had. We all know that there’s a backlog. The social workers actually have a backlog in children’s aid societies. We certainly can’t expect them to take on more work without extra funding. Private member’s bills can’t address extra funding, can’t demand of the government extra funding, so I think that might be problematic.", "Our teachers and our principals and our school administrators are professionals. I’ve said before that I was an optometrist. I certainly didn’t need a government bureaucrat to tell me which tests had to be done or whether or not a patient should have contact lenses or be referred to a specialist. I think that sometimes if we take away the ability of professionals to do their jobs, we’re actually belittling them and making them a lower-quality professional. We’re not empowering them, which is what we should be doing.", "I think that it would be nice if we had a motion where the Legislative Assembly of Ontario called on our school administrators, principals, teachers, community workers and families to address the fact that we’re very concerned as a Legislature about chronic absenteeism and what it can do to hold our children and youth back from pursuing their dreams later in life.", "I think we all know people who said, “I wish I worked harder in school. I wish I had parents who encouraged me more.” “It takes a village to raise a child” is the expression, but it really takes a community. I would like to see more engagement and see our schools do more after-school programs, not less. I think kids are shuffled around. Parents are stuck in traffic. Parents are working longer hours and distracted.", "We have issues with bullying, and maybe that’s part of the problem of absenteeism. We need professionals in our schools who are trained in mental health and trained to understand what is going on.", "There was an article very recently about a teacher in the States, who—I think it was once a month, on Fridays—would ask her students to fill out a questionnaire. One of the questions was, “Who do I want to be paired up with for the next month?” and things like that. What she would do is look at students who weren’t being requested; nobody requested to be paired up with them; nobody wanted to partner with them on any projects or sit with them. She would go and speak to that student and see what she could do to pair that student up with sympathetic other students and get them to have friends.", "It was her belief—this was after the shooting in Florida—that students who don’t have friends and aren’t socializing adequately become unsocialized. That could be chronic absenteeism. It could be part “what came first, really, the chicken or the egg?” They were absent a lot, or they were absent because they weren’t socializing. She would get that kid into a social circle. She felt that maybe she was preventing the next disassociated, angry teenager who is going to pick up a gun and go into a school. We don’t know, because this is all going to be anecdotal evidence.", "We heard the member from Etobicoke Centre talk about doing everything possible before we call CAS—absolutely. I think that’s what I’m trying to convey, that there are a lot of reasons why there’s chronic absenteeism. Some of them are valid, and some of them are an indication or a sign of problems, but it doesn’t mean that we should jump to call CAS. Maybe we can do more as a community. Maybe we need community organizations or non-profits that need to be called in to help first.", "I think that we all have a duty to report. We all have a duty, when we have children, to be committed to raising them. Maybe there’s a problem in society now that aunts and uncles and grandparents and neighbours aren’t more involved with raising our children. Perhaps it’s something we as a Legislature could call on communities to get more involved in, or perhaps we’re making it more difficult. Perhaps when we have legislation like this we’re actually saying to people, “You don’t have to get involved, because we have a law that says the CAS has to be called,” so I’m really not sure.", "I think we’re going to hear more about this topic.

She has a troubled son who misses a lot of school. He has had issues with his mental health since he was eight years old. He’s now 16.

This child may be a truant, but he’s not out running the streets. He’s not hanging out at the mall. He’s not boosting cars and taking his friends for a joyride. His parents aren’t ignoring him. They love him and care for him, and are frightened for his long-term future without counselling. The system is broken, and it has been broken for a long time.", "The lineups of children and youth waiting to be seen by a medical professional in Ontario are horrendous. Depending on where you live, it can be worse than horrendous. According to statistics released by Children’s Mental Health Ontario in their 2018 pre-budget document called Kids Can’t Wait: Improving Mental Health Outcomes for Ontario’s Children and Youth, the wait time for counselling fluctuates depending on your region. Kids have to wait 208 days on average in the Thunder Bay area and 354 days if they live in the Barrie region.

If you have a child with mental health issues and you’re waiting for counselling, you’re better off in the Waterloo region, as the wait times there are 109 days, compared to 575 in Ottawa, 354 in Barrie or 208 in Thunder Bay.

God forbid that’s happening here.", "Whether it’s home school, or 40 days, we need society to care for these children, because sometimes the parents may be suffering from mental illness themselves. The parents may be suffering from—as the member from Barrie said—there could be a divorce taking place. The mother could have postpartum depression. You need intervention, for the sake of that child who isn’t going to school.", "It’s not even so much that that child may be missing days of school—which is bad enough in not getting an education—but that child may be suffering. It could be abuse at home, either psychological abuse or physical abuse—you never know what’s happening—or the living conditions that the child is under. What kind of home are they in?", "Aren’t you curious about why someone is missing 40 days? I know I would be very, very concerned, as a parent, if I knew a neighbour or someone was missing 40 days. And you’re saying, “Don’t do anything.” Wait for how many days? Is it 60 days you want to wait for? Eighty days? A hundred days? And then you’re going to do something?", "This is about passion for the safety and protection of children. Our schools are charged with that immense responsibility. Teachers and principals try their very best, day in, day out. But every day, in every school, there is some child who needs a little bit of extra help. That’s what this is about.", "Not all children come from stable homes—homes where they are supported sometimes by grandparents or relatives or neighbours. In some cases, children come from very vulnerable situations. You know who knows first about these vulnerable situations? It’s usually the teacher, because good teachers—and thank God, we have some of the best schools and teachers. I know that in my own riding of Eglinton–Lawrence, I’m so fortunate. Whether you’re in John Wanless school, in the east end of my riding, which rates number two in all of Canada as a school, or Joyce public school, in the west end, which rates as one of the best schools in music and math in Ontario—it’s in a challenging area. John Wanless is in a good, up-and-coming area and Joyce is in a challenging area, and yet, they both are excellent schools. That is because the teachers really give a—can I say “damn”? No, I can’t. Okay. Anyway, they really care about the kids, and they are there every day.", "So all the member is saying is to make sure that when there are these outliers, we don’t wash our hands and say, “The system will take care of them. The system will protect them.” The member is saying, “Make this little change to involve more passionate professionals, like the child protection workers.” Thank God, there are even lawyers who are saying that this has got to be done. If a lawyer is saying change the law and you over there in the opposition are saying, “No, no. Don’t listen to the lawyers, don’t listen to the teachers and don’t listen to the child protection workers; 40 days doesn’t bother me”—well, it sure bothers me." ],

Other people went for two years on a boat around the world, and they took the curriculum and they went through it. If a bus is late, a child is not marked late because a bus is late.

It was almost as if we were invited in advance to Gord Downie’s wake.", "Canadians celebrated with Gord and his bandmates Rob Baker, Paul Langlois, Gord Sinclair and Johnny Fay. A true band of brothers, they had played together since 1984, criss-crossed the country dozens of times and together won 16 Juno Awards. They created summer soundtracks for an entire generation.", "Gord Downie viewed Canada through a distinctive poetic lens, and most of the poems involved his songs, songs that fans across the country know by heart. He was ahead of his time. The band’s first album had two songs about abused women seeking revenge.", "The CBC aired the Hip’s final concert live and nearly 12 million Canadians tuned in. Thanks to the CBC, it was seen around the world that night as well. The Globe and Mail said the concert “galvanized a nation.” I watched much of it from 35,000 feet while flying between Toronto and Calgary on my way to Yellowknife.", "Gord Downie died a couple of months after that concert, and here is what some media people said when he passed away.", "Vinay Menon wrote in the Toronto Star: “Stolen from us at the age of 53, Downie is leaving when we need him most. Who will write the songs that cross generations and slice across geography? Who will be our poet laureate and history professor, our spirited raconteur and unflinching critic, our tour guide to the past and cultural voyager of the future?”", "In Maclean’s magazine, Michael Barclay wrote, “Downie is considered by a lay audience as one of Canada’s greatest poets—even if he only ever published one book of poetry ... and his work is communicated primarily through a rock band.”", "Josh O’Kane, writing in the Globe and Mail, said, “Through songs such as Fifty Mission Cap and Ahead by a Century, Mr. Downie sung his poetry with both coos and howls, helping the band become kings of CanCon.” Yes, there was a ton of Canadian content in Gord Downie’s poetry.", "At the suggestion of the member for Kingston and the Islands, we held a moment of silence here in the Legislature when Gord Downie died. The Premier extended her condolences to his friends, family and fans across the country, saying, “Gord lived every single day of his life with grace and resilience. His music was a quintessential part of being Canadian. I know that there are millions—literally millions—of Canadians who are in mourning today. I want to say that he will be greatly missed by all of us.”", "My leader, the member from Hamilton Centre, speaking on behalf of New Democrats, extended our condolences, saying, “He and his band, the Tragically Hip, were inspirational artists of Canada, and they gave us a goodbye and a long tour that I think will always live in all of our hearts.”", "This bill is intended to keep alive the memory of Gord Downie. It’s intended to recognize his contribution to Canadian literature. It’s offered in a non-partisan fashion. It’s a symbolic way to pay tribute to Gord Downie.", "Maclean’s magazine put out a commemorative issue devoted entirely to Gord Downie, his life and legacy. In there, Michael Barclay wrote, “Poetry and pop music are not strangers, of course: just ask the committee who granted Bob Dylan the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature.”", "Laurie Brown, a former host on CBC Newsworld’s On the Arts, once wrote, “Gord doesn’t consider himself one of the greatest poets of the nation ... but he is!”", "Coke Machine Glow was the one book of poetry by Gord Downie.

Canada has a poet laureate, as does Toronto, Windsor, Brantford, London, Mississauga, Sudbury and other Ontario municipalities. Prince Edward Island has one, as does Saskatchewan. This isn’t the first time that the position of Ontario Poet Laureate has been suggested in this House. My friend the member from York Centre, Mr. Kwinter, and I have suggested this previously. The difference, on this occasion, is the timing of the bill.", "Canada was energized during the Tragically Hip’s final tour. As individuals we paid more attention to Gord Downie’s words and his poems and the Hip’s award-winning songs because we knew he didn’t have much time left on this earth. We came to appreciate the value that poetry brings to our culture, our history, our stories. Poetry, for some, had been a forgotten pleasure.", "There are many photographs of Gord Downie; in many of them he is wearing a blue jean jacket with a yellow button on his right chest. It says, “Open Books, Open Minds, Open Hearts.” An Ontario Poet Laureate would do just that. He or she would encourage people to open their minds to poetry, to read poetry, and to grow a true appreciation of the written word.", "As you know, over time, Gord Downie became an advocate for indigenous issues. Perry Bellegarde is the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations. He writes, “As a man of words, Gord’s lyrics and his poetry held up a mirror to Canada.... He was driven to use his platform to make the country he loved a better place. His words were his activism.”", "The Assembly of First Nations paid tribute to Gord Downie. He was given a star blanket, an eagle feather and a Lakota name, Wicapi Omani, “The Man Who Walks Among the Stars.” That is so fitting as, in Coke Machine Glow, Gord has a poem called Starpainters:", "The myth is neither here nor there,", "From the air.", "Just blue lake stains", "On green and purified, parcelled squares:", "A crazy quilt of spearmint,", "Of mustard and honey tones;", "A scuffed-up kitchen floor of tiles", "On top of bones", "With a big trap door.", "Towns down diagonal lines disappear", "And drop out of sight", "Into the night beyond the national night,", "And underneath the grit and glare", "Into unfettered nothingness and thin air,", "As herds of clouds lazily graze", "On thermal sighs of delight.", "The Starpainters are taking over now,", "Their scaffolding is in its place.", "Your anaesthesiologist tonight", "Is washing up and on her way.", "Gord Downie was always writing. He referred to it as “lifting the 400-pound feather.” In that Maclean’s tribute, the poet and editor Damian Rogers says, “Gord is part of a continuum of great Canadian songwriters who are actually poets”—Gordon Lightfoot, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell. “The greatest compliment you can give a poet is to say she’s a rock star. The greatest compliment that you can give a musician is to say he’s a poet. Gord Downie is both.”", "Damian Rogers went on to write, “I can’t think of anyone else of our generation who is so deeply engaged in this country’s poetry. Not just that he’s read by poets, which he is, but also: he reads them. I can’t overstate how unusual that is.” Gord Downie was a humble genius.", "The Premier told me she fully supports this bill, as does the Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport. I know the positive impact that Windsor’s first poet laureate, Marty Gervais, has had on our community, and I believe we will see similar results across Ontario. We need a poet laureate to speak on behalf of poets and to be another spokesperson for the arts in Ontario, to remind us there’s more to life than life in the fast lane.", "Canada’s seventh Parliamentary Poet Laureate was George Elliott Clarke.

To preserve his memory, I believe, is the right thing to do.", "I mentioned earlier we have three visitors with us from the Ontario Arts Council. Christen Thomas, actually, is the executive director of the Literary Press Group. Kirsten Gunter is the director of communications at the Ontario Arts Council, and Shoshana Wasser, communications coordinator at the Ontario Arts Council.

I had the pleasure of calling Gord Downie’s family. Mike Downie is a constituent of mine—his brother Patrick. I play hockey with Mike. I played hockey with Gord. In fact, I knew Gord Downie more as a hockey player than I did as a musician. Of course, I was familiar with his music. But we played hockey for two hours almost every Friday for about five, six years.", "Gord was poetry on ice. He could knock pucks out. We thought they were going in, and he somehow saved them. In fact, I remember a game—we played for two hours in a row. The scores would usually rack up to 12, 14, 9, 13, 11: He was going two hours of a shutout in pick-up hockey with a bunch of very talented hockey players, until the last 30 seconds. I snuck one into the top corner. I kind of felt bad about it, having broken his shutout, but the reality was he was so gracious about it. I bought him a beer afterwards, and that was Gord Downie, an extraordinary man.", "Thank you so much to the member from Windsor–Tecumseh. I talked to Mike today and I told him about the bill, and the family. Mike was fully supportive. He thinks this would be a wonderful tribute to his brother. He thinks Gord Downie would really have appreciated it. We’d all like to have had, maybe, Gord Downie be the first poet laureate. But if it immortalizes his name and his reputation for putting words together in ways that were memorable for generations to come, I’m fully, fully supportive of that.", "I also thought I might talk a little about some Shakespearean poetry. We’ve had the opportunity in this House on many occasions, and at Christmastime, I did a little tribute to the House in rhyming couplets and iambic pentameter.

Of course, as the member has mentioned, it was another Monte who brought forward a motion in 2009. It was unanimously adopted by the House. I’m also delighted to recognize that the member from Windsor–Tecumseh has brought this bill forward before, and I’m quite surprised that we haven’t acted on it yet. I appreciate very much this new sense of timing to immortalize Gord Downie. I commit here to working very closely to see if we can’t find a way to get this thing done and adopted so we can establish it.", "How expensive would it be for the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport to have someone in their office do a two-year review to find someone who is living in Ontario, who is comfortable writing poetry that reflects the province of Ontario, and then to have them go out and spend time with students in schools?

But I think it would be reasonable to have this reading today and have the government bring it back very soon for third and final reading. We could have a very quick vote on that and then get on with it. It makes a lot of sense to me.", "Frankly, Speaker, as you’re well aware, it would be a very fitting tribute to Gord Downie, to his contribution to this country, to this province and to this community. As well, it would be a very good step in showing the support that exists in this province for the arts. It would be a validation of the arts, stating that we see the huge benefits that come from integrating the arts into our everyday lives.", "This bill—I’ll just go into some of the background, noting that the term “poet laureate” is conferred on a poet officially appointed by a government or institution and assigned the responsibility of writing poems for special events or occasions. Now, I would say special events being the House coming back after an election and the House rising before an election, I’m sure there would be tragi-comic poems that could be written—heavy on the tragedy, heavy on the comedy—that would be widely appreciated by the people of this province.", "It’s not clear, apparently, who appointed the first poet laureate, but the idea of a scribe, a writer or someone who writes poetry for a community or for a government is something that has been around for a long time. In fact, I believe the idea originated first in medieval Europe, so it’s a long tradition. We wouldn’t be breaking a lot of new ground here. I don’t think people have to be worried that we’d be setting a precedent that would upend western civilization. We would be continuing in this mainstream of having the arts express what really goes on in our lives.", "There are at least 15 countries that have recognized an official poet laureate. In the United States, they have subnational governments that have done this as well.", "Here in Canada, we have a Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate, who is an appointed officer of the Library of Parliament. It makes complete sense to me. If you want to understand the world, mathematics is a wonderful thing, science is a wonderful thing, but you have to have arts to actually capture the essence and to understand what is at the very core of our lives and express it in a way that moves people, that brings them out of themselves to have a bigger picture of everyday life.", "Provinces and territories have appointed poet laureates. It’s certainly within our purview and certainly within our capabilities to do exactly the same.", "Speaker, there’s not a lot more that I need to add. I think that the speech given by the member covered it all, but I do want to recap and I do want to reinforce this to the government: You control the agenda. It would be very, very easy for you to have this come forward.

He often speaks in rhyme, to the delight of the House and to those watching at home.", "In fact, his riding—or the city of Windsor, rather—recently decided to become the capital of poetry by appointing not one but three poets laureate. While several cities in Ontario have a poet laureate, none has three, so Windsor definitely leads as the wordsmiths capital. And who knows? Maybe all that stuff that drives poets—excitement, angst, love, sadness, frustrations of the communities they live in—maybe Windsor has that extra inspiration to support it.", "I think it’s important, where possible, to provide that space, so people can recite or sing the praises or pitfalls of their own communities and loved ones, and it will be the poet laureate’s job to champion that space and opportunity.", "This opportunity is even more relevant in smaller cities and places where residents don’t have access to things like museums, ballet, opera, the symphony or other blockbuster art events. Then they have even more reason to look to a poet laureate as a way to promote literature and to contribute and build a thriving arts and culture scene.", "My riding has a few thriving arts communities, but Owen Sound has had its poet laureate for about 10 years. Currently, the literary ambassadorship is with Lauren Best, who succeeded Rob Rolfe and Larry Jensen, who shared that role.", "Ms. Best is a 27-year-old musician, music instructor and multi-arts educator who was born in Mississauga, but moved to Owen Sound at age nine. She has been writing poetry since she was a child. She’s very excited about the opportunity to engage the Owen Sound community into being creative, especially focusing on children and youth and helping them develop an appreciation and maybe even sprout their own voice. She said that it is important to have this platform and the ability to engage with the community creatively. I think that Lauren Best was a great choice because of her energy, and I believe she’ll be successful in creating, as she says, “as many ripples” as she can.", "I also want to add another comment from her. It’s about the work that awaits her in her community, which has a strong tradition of supporting the literary arts. She described it as “kind of like being a surfer dropped on a beach that has really great waves.… You could have been dropped on any beach, but thank goodness you were dropped on this beach.”", "One of the more passionate local scribes comes from the small community of Clavering: Larry Miller, my friend and MP for Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, who like to rhyme off on the Hill.

I would just like to say that I often use poetry. I’ve done a number of eulogies sadly, but it’s a privilege. I often recite poetry as a way to bring a little bit of levity to the situation and to honour those. So I’m a big fan. I’m a big fan of Mr. Hatfield, so I wish you very well and will be proud to support this bill." ],

  "text" : [ "Today, it’s truly an honour and a pleasure to rise in the House and speak in response to my colleague Percy Hatfield and his bill, Poet Laureate of Ontario Act (In Memory of Gord Downie).", "I think that Gord Downie is a very good example of the power of poetry and its lasting power over years and years and years. Another great example is when you hear the poem In Flanders Field, right? It says so much in so few words. I don’t have a personal history with Gord Downie. I think that we wish that we all could have. But he has made a big impact in my family’s life, as he has in all of ours, on two occasions.", "The first occasion: My youngest daughter came home from school and she had a project that she was a bit worried about. The project was that she had to demonstrate a musical group’s impact on a country and the meaning of their music. I’m not going to say how old Vicky is, but she’s from the generation where their music’s a bit—the stuff she listens to is a bit meaningless, in my opinion. She and I went and looked up the Tragically Hip catalogue. We had such an amazing time together, looking through the lyrics and researching what those lyrics truly meant. It was such a bonding experience. I think every Canadian who’s ever listened to the Tragically Hip, when you really study—I listen to the Tragically Hip, but I never really studied them until my daughter came home with that project. That made a big difference in our lives.", "The second impact the Tragically Hip had on our family—and I’d like to give a shout-out to the Kirkland Lake Festivals Committee. In 2015 the Tragically Hip played for two sold-out shows in northern Ontario in Kirkland Lake. That was a true bonding experience for us all. I don’t think anyone in that arena ever felt more Canadian than at those two concerts. It was fantastic. Again, it’s a shout-out to the festivals committee because I don’t think they made money on those, but they sure brought everyone together and it was an incredible experience. That is something that the Tragically Hip and Gord Downie have brought to us all. It shows the power of words, the power of well-crafted words, the power of poetry and how poetry can last indefinitely and can truly represent an area.", "We’ve heard that other areas across the world, across the country and across the province have poets laureate. There’s also a poet laureate in my riding. The little town of Cobalt has a poet laureate. Cobalt was once named the most historic town in Canada. It had a silver boom in the early 1900s. It went from zero to 30,000 people and now it’s at 1,200. But now, because of electric cars, it might boom again. Now it’s not silver that’s in demand; now it’s cobalt. I would be remiss if I didn’t read a poem by Ann Margetson, the poet laureate of Cobalt:", "The Blacksmith", "Fred LaRose was a blacksmith in Cobalt town,", "At a log cabin near the rail lines, he often did frown,", "For he worked long hours to make a living quite hard,", "Hammering and toiling away with great regard", "For the work he had to do, and a fox often came to view,", "That drove him crazy seeing the fox, what could he do", "To the pesky fox looking all cute his head on one side,", "His great frustration he found so very hard to hide.", "Working away one day with his furnace and hammer,", "His frustration made him splutter a little, then stammer,", "He lifted his hand and sent his hammer flying high,", "But the fox ran off without a yelp, whimper or cry.", "Then the hammer hit the rock and there before his eyes", "Was the wonderful sight of silver, such a great surprise.", "After a while he was happy to sell his share of silver bright", "And all the cobalt and other ore that was hidden from sight.", "He sold his claim for quite a good price and retired in Quebec,", "Although he lost lots of capital, he thought, “Oh, what the heck.”", "The log cabin is still standing but moved to safer ground,", "I wonder if the ghost of the fox close by has ever been found?", "Basically, that is the legend of how silver was found in Cobalt. The train was being built to get to the clay fields actually, to get to farming country. The legend is that Fred LaRose threw his axe at a fox, and that’s how they found silver. No one really knows if that legend is 100% accurate, but Fred LaRose was a blacksmith in Cobalt.", "Many people came to Cobalt, many people made a fortune in Cobalt, and many people, as did Mr. LaRose, lost the fortune that they made in Cobalt. But it shows how the power of poetry, in a few verses, can show the story of a town, of a province, of a country, and that’s why we fully support the bill to create a poet laureate and we fully agree that it could be done before the House rises." ],

It really is an emotional loss for individuals who have known Gord Downie and the Tragically Hip as a band. It was a real emotional loss when he met his death, which was so public because of his fame throughout this country.", "The power of poetry has been mentioned here, and indeed it is very significant. Poets laureate around the world have had a profound effect on the nation or the province or the municipality, or just the group of people with whom they’ve been associated. Gord Downie is no exception to that, because he did have that profound effect on Canadians.", "I know that in my own city of St. Catharines, councillor Bruce Williamson from Port Dalhousie ward was talking about Gord Downie at council and knew that Gord Downie was ill at the time. He was really hopeful that he would, in fact, be honoured appropriately with the Order of Canada; there’s a procedure you have to go through, which is somewhat bureaucratic. I think everyone was delighted that Gord Downie was indeed inducted into the Order of Canada.", "I know people were thinking of the band, but Gord himself was a genuine leader and the causes he took up were causes that you don’t normally, but sometimes, find with the head of a rock band or the head of a musical band. It happens sometimes; there are instances of that. But certainly the causes he took up personally were ones which had an impact on the federal government, particularly as it relates to policies related to the indigenous population in Canada.", "I know Kingston was very proud of Gord Downie. The other thing I think that people liked about him was he was very down-to-earth. If I think of the music, the music itself is very pleasing to people, but in addition to the music and perhaps more important than the music were the words themselves, as the member for Windsor–Tecumseh has so eloquently shared information about Gord Downie and the poetry that he left with us. That did have an effect on people, on their own psyche perhaps, but also their own view of our nation and the issues before us.", "He was truly Canadian. We Canadians tend to not be braggarts, to not be expressing our pride about a lot of things, but even though Gord Downie and the Tragically Hip were extremely popular with Canadians, beyond our borders, people appreciated the music and the words of the Tragically Hip, led by Gord Downie.", "I think it’s most appropriate. We deal with a lot of issues in this House, some which are very serious issues—and I think this is a serious one by the way, but very serious issues where we’re confronting one another over political philosophy. What I hear in the debate this afternoon, which is so encouraging, is that people from all of the political parties—actually, of the four parties represented in this House, three of those parties have had representatives who have spoken this afternoon in glowing terms about Gord Downie and have commended the member for Windsor–Tecumseh for taking up this particular cause. I should never predict the outcome of votes. My suspicion is, however, that this will be a unanimous vote." ],

I know, even in my short period of time here, I’ve come to recognize and hear of his dedication to poetry and his passion for music, arts and culture across Ontario.", "Here in Ontario, we do have such a strong, vibrant community of artists and poets to recognize and to champion. When we look at Gord Downie, as so many members in this House have spoken about, he’s made such an incredible impact just in this House, with the amount of people he has interacted with. The member for Sault Ste. Marie mentioned briefly to me that Gord actually attended Algoma University in Sault Ste. Marie. The member for Elgin–Middlesex–London mentioned that he waited outside of H&M in university when the newest Tragically Hip album was coming out. I think that just speaks to the testament that Gord brought into this world, whether it was his work in philanthropy or his work for indigenous reconciliation and protecting water rights. The amount of work that he put in should definitely be recognized by this piece of legislation.", "It is interesting to note that our federal cousins in the federal Parliament have a poet laureate. We see poets laureate in many municipalities across our province and in various provinces. It’s a fitting tribute to one of the truly great Ontarian artists that we bring forward this position, the position of poet laureate, which recognizes his contributions and also recognizes the importance of arts, music and culture in our communities.", "Before time runs out, I wanted to let everyone know that actually, one of the most amazing things I’ve had the opportunity to see was in my home community in Grimsby. Last summer, during the final tour, the total of Main Street in Grimsby was shut down. They projected the final concert of the Tragically Hip on Main Street in Grimsby, and hundreds and hundreds of people from across the community, children of all ages, people I would say from age zero to 100, were there. It was really a wonderful way to bring the community together, people who might be of different political stripes, different beliefs, different values, but were able to recognize one of the truly great Canadians.", "I wish to thank the member for Windsor–Tecumseh for his contribution today." ],

It’s brought to pay homage to a great Canadian. Mr. Tabuns told us how he went door-to-door, and he knocked on this door, and this humble genius invited him in. I’ll tell you how humble he was: He had a family van, Gord Downie. He called it the Black Potato or the Stinkmobile.", "There’s wine in the LCBO, Tragically Hip wine—red and white. This was an uncommon band, an uncommon band of brothers, as I’ve mentioned.", "Gord Downie used to say it’s “like lifting a 400-pound feather every day.” I know there’s a Van Morrison song that says that his job is turning lead into gold. That’s what the creativity is of writers. They have this process to go through and at the end, there’s magic.", "I want to thank the Premier for telling me it was okay to say that this bill had her full support.

He’s going to move on up to poet laureate emeritus. We’re going to have two more, and one of them is going to be a youth poet laureate.

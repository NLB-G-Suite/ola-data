Transportation is important, and obviously road safety is important.", "In the province of Ontario, we’ve been building roads to get from A to B. I do know that, well before the present province of Ontario was established, roads have certainly been under construction going back for the last several hundred years. I know that my great-grandfather and my grandfather were responsible for Mill Road. At that time, you were responsible for the road in front of your farm. In the spring, out would come the horses and a scraper, and they would attempt to grade that road. I always considered it our road. Our home farm is still on Mill Road.", "We build roads. It obviously fosters social life and, most importantly, economic life, but also designed and built—construction—to be as safe as possible.", "In in my riding over the last 12 years, there are several projects—provincial issues—that are long overdue. Particularly, I would like to briefly make reference, because we’re talking about transportation, to the bypasses and bridges of Haldimand county. There are several projects. Studies have been done—ongoing debate over the years. We need a link from the Hamilton airport bypass down to the Caledonia bypass.", "The reason I say that is primarily for reasons of safety: Old Highway 6, south of Hamilton, coming down Upper James south towards Caledonia, is a four-lane highway with no barrier in between. There have been some horrendous accidents and deaths on that stretch of highway; right around Haldibrook Road on provincial Highway 6. We need the construction of that bypass. I have a Ministry of Transportation map in my office that shows the planned bypass as a series of dotted lines, again, pretty well coming down from Hamilton airport to the Caledonia bypass bridge over the Grand River.", "We need a Hagersville truck bypass. Provincial Highway 6 comes right through town. It always has, ever since the inception of provincial Highway 6. With the heavy trucks, particularly steel, coming out of US Steel—again, the noise, the congestion and serious truck accidents that have occurred over the years, a number of them recently, right in downtown Hagersville. It’s timely: I just received a report, a master’s paper coming out of the University of Guelph authored by Wilrik Banda—he worked with me, the mayor and others on this report—outlining the complete story on the need for a Hagersville bypass.", "A third major project that has been in abeyance for 12 years—in fact, it was about to begin back when I was a government member—is the Caledonia bridge over the Grand River, a 700-foot span, that was built back in 1927. It’s long overdue for replacement. Again, it’s limited: You can’t put trucks over that. I don’t think you can put a fire truck over that bridge. I’d be very worried about some of the heavy equipment going over a bridge like that. Again, it’s long overdue; certainly, over the last 12 years.", "Another bridge is the Cayuga bridge. This is another very serious holdup. The Cayuga bridge was built in 1924. Again, it’s long overdue for replacement. Granted, these bridges seem to be holding up. There have been repairs. But these major bridges on major provincial highways, across the Grand River, 700 or 800 feet long, are long overdue to be replaced.", "I’ve stood out on the Cayuga bridge. In fact, the late Bob Baigent was quite a champion of replacing this 1924 bridge. He asked me to take the time someday to walk out on that bridge, stand in the middle of the bridge, wait for a heavy load of steel, a load of coil, to come along, and see what it does to that bridge.", "Again, this legislation, to its credit, is all about safety. I support much of what’s in this legislation. Again, the title of Bill 31, Making Ontario’s Roads Safer—we have to get on with this.", "There’s a clear and present issue with the last project I mentioned, the Cayuga bridge. I stood in this House before Christmas and indicated that the Ontario Ministry of Transportation are doing their best to try to get around the delays with constructing the Cayuga bridge. The serious problem—and this is a justice issue; it’s a law-and-order issue—is that the bridge periodically gets occupied by native activists from Six Nations. They take over the bridge. This has happened several times now. Construction workers, essentially, determine that discretion is better than valour, and they leave, oftentimes within minutes. That’s downright dangerous. The last time this happened, the barge, the equipment, was down below in the bridge while winter was coming, and there was certain work that had to be done.", "I do know that our Minister of Aboriginal Affairs has been involved with this, but that’s not good enough. I just reiterate my call today to Ontario’s Minister of Community Safety; we need him down there as well. The Ministry of Transportation is trying. The Minister of Aboriginal Affairs—again, I’ve observed this for the last nine years with respect to the Grand River and Caledonia and Cayuga—has been relatively ineffective.", "I will point out that this coming Saturday, February 28—I regret to say this—is the ninth anniversary of the occupation of a very large subdivision in the town of Caledonia. That’s nine years of mayhem, disorder, serious construction delays, and blockades.", "I’ve distributed photographs to every member of this House of a group of native activists lifting a minivan over the side of a bridge and dropping it on the provincial highway down below. It was either on fire when they pushed it over the overpass or was set on fire down below. I have those photographs; it has been nine years. We talk about OPP investigations here. The OPP have had those photographs for nine years. Nobody has ever been charged with throwing this minivan off the overpass onto a provincial highway. This is what goes on down in Caledonia.", "Because of this chill—and I see it as essentially political correctness run wild—we don’t have action. We can’t get anything done down there, and it’s downright dangerous. I have had people phone me because their sister is in a coma in the hospital because native activists have shut down a highway like the bypass in Caledonia, and you get these godawful detours around back roads; however, people are still barrelling down these secondary roads at provincial highway speed.", "The more that we can do, as this title suggests, under Bill 31 to make Ontario roads safer would serve my riding very well and would serve Haldimand county very well. All we ask is for the law to kick in and for these projects to kick forward.", "Speaker, whether it be transportation or native protests on the highways or on the main street of Caledonia shutting down infrastructure projects, very simply all we ask is a return—I don’t think it’s too much to ask—to peace, order and good government." ],

It is legislation that they should be doing it.", "Sadly, I was down in the Windsor area just after Christmas for a family friend’s father’s funeral, and I was so impressed and so struck by how many cars actually pulled over as the funeral procession was going by. That’s not something that’s legislated; that, to me, is just good common courtesy and respect for the person who had passed. It was just so striking to see all the people—almost every car actually did that and allowed the whole funeral procession to go by.", "But it raises the issue, again, of the green lights.

They’re speeding to try to get to, perhaps, your loved one—you are injured; your house is on fire—and people are pulling over and ensuring that they can do that, so they can go on unimpeded and get there as quickly as possible.

This is a very comprehensive bill that brings together two previous pieces of legislation that were introduced in the last Parliament but not passed: the Highway Traffic Statute Law Amendment Act, which gave municipalities additional tools to collect defaulted traffic fines from drivers; and the Highway Traffic Amendment Act, which included provisions to enhance pedestrian, driver and cyclist safety.", "In addition, Bill 31 includes important new measures to deal with drugged driving as well as stiffer penalties for distracted driving, which has become the number one killer on Ontario’s roads, as we hear from the OPP.", "Since I have limited time for debate today, I won’t be able to speak to all the provisions of the bill, but I did want to highlight a couple of aspects that are particularly significant for my community. Those are the cycling safety provisions, which were originally introduced by my NDP colleague the member for Parkdale–High Park, and municipal traffic fine collection.", "There is great work going on in my community to promote cycling and encourage more Londoners to cycle. The Medway Working Group has been working hard on a plan to identify and address barriers to active transportation, including, of course, cycling. Earlier this month, the city of London launched its rapid transit initiative, Shift, a plan that will also map safe cycling routes throughout the city.", "This Friday there is going to be a mapping party organized by London Cycle Link to engage the community in planning London’s new bicycle routes. Of course, provincial legislation to ensure the safety of cyclists is vital to support and strengthen and grow these local initiatives.", "The other part of the bill that is critical for London, as well as communities across the province, are the new tools for municipalities to collect unpaid fines. We heard during pre-budget hearings from the mayor of London about the millions in unpaid traffic fines that are owed to the city. Certainly, municipalities need these tools, and the bill is a good step to streamline the process. We, on this side of the House, do have some questions about how the bill will enable the collection of fines from out-of-province drivers, and how it will enable the sharing of information across ministries.", "I’m going to use the remainder of my time to focus on the section of Bill 31 that clarifies doctors’ and optometrists’ obligations regarding medical licence suspensions.

This is a matter that is critical to my constituents in London West, especially those who rely on their vehicles for employment.", "Bill 31 includes regulations to prescribe which medical professionals must support a medical condition and which medical conditions must be supported. Clearly, clarifying these responsibilities is a welcome improvement over the current situation, which is open-ended about responsibilities for reporting the medical conditions that may make it dangerous for a person to drive. My main concern, as I mentioned, is that the bill does not do anything to address the other issue related to medical licence suspensions: the wait times once the medical condition has been resolved.", "The ministry currently says that their target service standard is four weeks for a driver to get their licence back after a medical suspension. The ministry says that they hit this service standard 85% to 90% of the time. I can’t speak for the other members of this House and what is happening in the rest of the province, but I can tell you that in London West the ministry is not even coming close to meeting that target.", "I’d like to share with this House the stories of some of my constituents whose jobs and ability to earn a living have been put directly at risk because they have been forced to wait months and months for the ministry to reissue their driver’s licences.", "My first example is Dave Wilson, a transit driver who had a medical issue that resulted in his class C commercial licence being downgraded to a class G. Dave was required to serve a waiting period while his medical condition was being treated. When his waiting period ended, in October 2014, Dave contacted the ministry to ask what was required from the medical review section to get his licence reinstated.", "He was told he needed a letter from his doctor. So he promptly went to his doctor, got the letter and faxed it to the ministry. Two months later, Dave received a letter from the ministry saying he, in fact, needed a full medical as well as many other forms to be completed by his doctor.", "Now, why did the ministry not give Dave that information the first time, when he inquired in October about what he needed to do? Dave immediately faxed the medical reports that were required from his physician to the ministry, but it then took numerous inquiries from my office before he finally received a letter from the Ministry of Transportation giving him leave to reapply for his class C commercial licence.", "Speaker, it took more than four months for Dave to get the okay to begin the process of having his licence reinstated. Over that period, Dave’s employer became concerned about the length of time it was taking for the reinstatement of his licence. Dave worried that he could lose his job. Four months is a completely unacceptable length of time for someone to wait, especially when they are as diligent as Dave was in terms of contacting the ministry to find out what the next steps were in the process.", "My second example is Peter Hanford, owner of Hanford’s Tire and Service, located in London West. Peter experienced a medical issue in September 2014 which resulted in his licence getting a medical suspension. In November, Peter’s physician gave him the green light. He submitted his health information to the ministry. He was obviously anxious to get his licence reinstated. He made numerous attempts to contact the MTO and was often forced to wait in an answering machine queue for longer than an hour. All he wanted to do was find out why he had not heard back from the ministry about the status of his licence.", "My office also became involved, inquiring with the ministry about the status of Peter’s case. Two months later, my office received a response from the ministry indicating that more medical information was required. Again, this is well beyond the 30-day ministry service standard response time. So we’re now nearing the end of February—remember that this issue first started in September 2014—and Peter Hanford’s situation has yet to be resolved.", "Peter has described the process of having his licence reinstated as “excruciating.” He says it has been “impossible to get information about what is required from the MTO.”", "A third example—yet another example—is Steve Everett, who has also experienced long delays, along with the ministry misplacing his medical records while he’s been dealing with the medical review section of the Ministry of Transportation. Steve had a job offer and has come very close to losing out on his ability to get employment because of the ministry’s delays, through no fault of his own.", "These are just a few of the stories I’ve been hearing from my constituents. They highlight the fact that unacceptably long wait times at the MTO are jeopardizing people’s ability to find and maintain employment.", "Certainly Bill 31 is an important piece of legislation. We’re glad to see it move forward. But I’m also concerned that it does not address the serious issue I have raised about wait times at the ministry. The ministry’s practice of conducting reviews on a first-come, first-served basis does not take into account the impact on people who depend on their vehicle for employment or basic mobility.", "I look forward to a response from the Minister of Transportation about the concerns I have raised today." ],

There are, of course, many, many different components regarding this bill, whether we’re dealing with impaired driving—whether it’s due to alcohol, drugs—enforcement issues or demerit points. Perhaps I might, just for a moment, as a physician parliamentarian, speak a little bit about the medical aspects.", "There are, in the course of medical practice many, many different conditions that can affect the ability to drive, whether it’s related to eyesight or drug addictions, drug dependence and, of course, alcoholism; but even, perhaps, hidden conditions, conditions you may not really recognize if you just meet an individual, whether, for example, it’s the predisposition to have low sugar attacks, or hypoglycemia, in insulin-dependent diabetics—or even individuals who have conditions such as epilepsy.", "So I think it’s very important that physicians out there who are counselling, treating, and catering to their patients’ needs let them know that this is one more aspect of counselling they should be aware of. It’s probably not, generally speaking, really part of a standardized medical history to get a “driving” history, but as these conditions occur on a very frequent basis, and as many of these conditions can be hidden, I will use this opportunity, as I said, to let Ontarians know—and of course my physician colleagues particularly—that this this is an aspect that needs to be catered to. As well, perhaps, hopefully directly, addressing some of the concerns which are of course very legitimate, I think we’ve all had the experience of attempting to communicate with various ministries and having things disappear into the vortex. But I think this is yet another aspect.", "The reinstatement of your licence after a medical condition has precluded it is, I think, something that of course we will devote our attention to." ],

I would suggest that if bicycles enjoyed the rules of the road, period, they wouldn’t have to worry about bicycle signals, as I read this bill.", "The other one is that this bill amends the act to remove the prohibition against riding or operating a bicycle on a crosswalk. I myself would like that to be struck out. I think it’s very important that on crosswalks, if they’re going across the street or whatever they’re doing around a crosswalk, they should dismount their bike. I’ve had to dodge them out here when I have come down Wellesley Street when they’re fooling around in these crosswalks riding their bicycles.", "Something that I think is very serious in this bill is the one metre between a vehicle and a bicycle when a motor vehicle is passing a bicycle. It says at least one metre. I would suggest that for large transport trucks going by bicycles, especially out in the country, that are going at the speed limit, one metre isn’t enough because they can be sucked into these things. I think the government should rethink that one a little bit.", "I think this bill was made for the city, not so much for the country." ],

They’re waiting so long before they are even getting to the point of frustration for them to be coming to our offices. When they get to our offices, our staff are calling, trying to get the MTO to move quicker, but as she said, it’s on a first-come, first-served basis. You have to wait until the proper table is there to speak in regard to your issue when yet they have a doctor’s note—the same doctor who took them off of their licence and said that they can’t drive doesn’t have the qualifications, I guess, would be the concerns of the Ministry of Transportation, to be able to say that the person can have their licence back. If they’re good enough to say that they can take it away, why is it that a doctor cannot reinstate their licence? Why do we have to go months and months on end to be able to get these licences back for our constituents? Quite frankly, it could just as well make them lose their job." ],

There has been a tremendous increase in that.", "I live in Scarborough. Everyone in Scarborough has to have a car, a bicycle or a motorcycle to move into downtown Toronto or to commute to work. People don’t want to wait for the bus service or a taxi drive; they’d rather drive or take a bicycle or some other way of transportation downtown. I’ve seen this all throughout the city, and even when you drive outside of the city: that there are a lot of vehicles out there and it’s getting more and more distracted. I’ve noticed more people texting and more people on their phones even though it’s prohibited—distracted drivers who pay more attention to their phone in front of them than to the road that’s in front of them. Instead, they look at their texting, or they’re messaging or they call someone and they get on the phone. It’s very distracting.", "This bill increases the fines and makes it a bit stricter. There have been a lot of accidents on roads. It’s easier to hit someone when you’re distracted—either on a bicycle or a pedestrian. It happens all the time in my riding and happens all throughout Ontario. I’ve noticed, in my area of Scarborough Southwest, almost every weekend someone gets hit on the road, usually fatally.

That call was repeated in reports in 2010, 2012 and 2013. So, clearly, there is a need for bicycle safety provisions to protect both cyclists and pedestrians." ],

Although we have been back here at Queen’s Park for just a week, this is the first opportunity that I’ve had to speak on a government bill—not that I’ve been quiet in the Legislature. I’ve had plenty of things to say in question period about the shameful conduct of the Premier and her government in the unprecedented report that was tabled last Thursday by the Chief Electoral Officer.", "Speaker, one of the centrepieces in Bill 31 is that it takes steps towards getting tough on distracted driving. We all know that when you’re behind the wheel, you have to be focused on what’s in front of you. I only wish that I could get some piece of legislation to penalize the Premier for distracted governing. That’s what I’ll call it. Like a distracted driver behind the wheel, the Premier, I think, is an accident waiting to happen. The problem is, she’s taking the people of Ontario along for the ride.

As I said earlier, some of them are welcome and are already having good debate in the Legislature. I know that many of our municipal partners—mayors, councillors from all over rural Ontario are here in Toronto this week for the annual ROMA/OGRA conference, affectionately called Good Roads. I know many of them are interested in the bill, and that’s because the legislation finally provides some help for those municipalities to collect on the millions of dollars—and some may suggest it’s upwards of $1 billion—in unpaid fines from delinquent drivers. It’s something that they have been raising for years in meetings here at the Good Roads conference at the Royal York and also at the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. So finally some of those municipalities can look at their colleagues and say that they’re finally getting some action on that very important item.", "Right now, if a motorist decides that they’re going to toss away the ticket for a traffic or parking offence and ignore the fine, the municipalities—and in my riding that would be the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville—are really left in the lurch. They’ve got really no mechanism that’s available to them to get that driver and force them to pay up. So Bill 31 does address this by ensuring that any driver in default on the payment of the fine can’t renew their licence plate. I know there have been many other speakers that have addressed it.", "I know that my warden of the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville, David Gordon, and his colleagues on counties’ council in Leeds and Grenville welcome the bill on that particular aspect regarding the fines.", "When I speak to people back home, the item that they always mention about Bill 31 is certainly the distracted driving component. It’s a huge issue, especially for young people, new drivers on the road. We all know that cellphones and other hand-held devices have become so very prevalent in our society. I know that the member for Ottawa South, when he was speaking on that bill, could barely contain himself. He was holding his cellphone up. He gave a great example of why this component of the bill is so important, because many of our constituents are attached to their cellphones.", "There have been many tragedies on the road, unfortunately, because of distracted driving. Some of the members have presented statistics. I heard a number of times the issue that back in 2013, 78 people lost their lives due to distracted driving claims. So there have been some unnecessary deaths.", "I want to talk about an event that had some public awareness in my riding about a year ago. I was honoured to go to one of my local high schools, Brockville Collegiate Institute, for the launch of their Celebrate My Drive campaign. It was with the folks from the Brockville State Farm office. It was a really good event, and it was an even better event because the campaign that the school got involved in ended up getting them $25,000. They were motivated with that program because they wanted to honour one of their late classmates, Aaron Stevenson. He was a beloved student at BCI who lost his life when he was struck by a vehicle while skateboarding. It was a horrific hit-and-run incident just weeks before the start of the school year. So this road safety aspect—the school won $25,000. Part of the funds were used to encourage the use of reflective tape for skateboarders and to help defray the cost of driver education for students who really couldn’t afford to pay for it. So even in this tragedy, the legacy that the classmates had for their friend Aaron and the lessons for students really turned their grief into a very, very powerful force for good. I wanted to tell that story on the record, Speaker.", "I also want to get back to the distracted driving portion. As we all know, the bill increases the fine for using a hand-held device, up to $300 to $1,000 from the current $60 to $500, and I think that’s a very good portion to start.", "I know the minister has talked about bringing in a three-demerit-point penalty for distracted driving. I’m disappointed, though, that there’s no mention of that in the legislation, nor has the minister used the authority he has to bring it forward in regulation. I am disappointed about that.", "In his leadoff, though—I want to give credit to my colleague the member for Kitchener–Conestoga, our transportation critic, who touched on the fact so much of Bill 31 has been left to regulations. Certainly that’s a concern, because it’s never good to give this government a blank cheque. So I applaud him for putting those comments on the record. We all know that in a bill like this, the devil in the legislation is in the details. Many of them remain unknown. I’ve had a number of questions about the bill from my constituents. There is a number of them who are very concerned about sections of the legislation dealing with the vehicle inspection centre system, and I can tell you, Speaker, you can add me to the list of skeptics.", "I’m very worried about how the government will go about dealing with what are admittedly some very real concerns about unrepaired vehicles on our roads. We need to look no further than to the Drive Clean program, which continues to gouge motorists even after it has been shown that that program now does not deal with the emissions side. The last thing motorists need—besides a carbon tax—is a mandatory, costly vehicle inspection scheme. I’m troubled about that.", "Speaker, I’ve got some other things I want to get on the record in my final two minutes, and I want to thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to address this very important bill." ],

Into the onboard computer that he has, but it’s not a voice-activated onboard computer. No, while he’s driving he actually has to look at this computer and punch in the licence plate of the vehicle that he wants to inquire about.

If I recall, the former Minister of Transportation in the last Parliament may have introduced something similar along these lines on distracted driving and introduced a fine of—I think it was up to $500.

Speaker, others have made comments already about some of the useful provisions that are in this act: the requirement of a one-metre distance between a vehicle and a bicycle—that improves road safety; action on drugged driving—that obviously is an advance and a plus that most people in Ontario can support. But I want to say as well that there are a variety of missed opportunities in this bill that I hope will be addressed at the committee stage. I have to say this bill doesn’t deal with the fallout from privatization and the growing lack of accountability that comes with the privatization of motor vehicle administration or regulation. It undermines the ability of the public to hold authorities to account.", "I want to speak about specific sections in this bill. First, with regard to motor vehicle inspection centres, currently the province licenses and oversees private motor vehicle inspection centres, which certify regular passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles. Fair enough, Speaker. I think that’s something that should be done by government; I don’t think it should be contracted out.", "I note that in 2008, the Auditor General found serious flaws in the commercial vehicle inspection system, observing that “the ministry does not exercise adequate oversight of this process and has little effective control over the issuance of safety standard certificates to inspection stations. We therefore questioned whether the ministry has adequate assurance that this certification process ensures the mechanical safety of commercial vehicles.”", "Speaker, that’s a very alarming and substantive statement. If we have motor vehicle inspection stations that are there to ensure that as we are travelling on a bus or driving down the road beside a truck, we are not going to be subjected to an accident because that vehicle that we’re in or beside is unsafe, one would expect that the government would want to have, if not outright ownership, which I would recommend, much tighter control over this particular aspect of motor vehicle regulation.", "But in fact the bill is going to enhance the distance between public accountability and control and these vehicle inspection stations. The bill repeals sections 86 and 88 to 100 of the Highway Traffic Act, and adds new sections enabling broad regulations to replace the current system with a completely new system under an unspecified model. The deputy minister has confirmed that a private, delegated administrative authority model is under consideration and that the spectrum of delegated models could include completely divested.", "Speaker, people throughout this province, and legislators throughout this chamber, have had to deal with condominium problems, have had to deal with people whose interaction with Tarion, a regulator that has essentially been taken out of the control of this Legislature—they’ve had to deal with that agency when they’ve had problems with their condominiums.", "I have to tell you, Speaker, that I have many new condo owners in my riding who are not happy with an agency they cannot access, and that runs itself for its own interest. If we were to follow that road, as it were, with this particular part of road safety regulation, we would be making a grave error.", "The bill specifies that the administrator of the new vehicle inspection centre system is “not an agent of the crown,” and thus wouldn’t be subject to normal oversight by the government agencies committee, the Ombudsman or the Auditor General, unless the service agreement with the ministry allows for such oversight.", "If we have a situation in which we’ve had a history of problems, a history of failure of accountability, one doesn’t go further into that particular problem; one doesn’t deepen the problem. One tries to correct it. What the government is doing with this section of the bill is making it very difficult for us as legislators—for us as citizens—to actually correct problems that exist in motor vehicle inspections.", "Why on earth that would be an object of this bill is beyond me. Has the government not learned from other privatization and deregulation experiences? Apparently not. This is an element that cries out to be dealt with when we get to committee. It needs to be amended.", "I want to talk, as well, about Highway 407. For those who need a little background, the Highway 407 toll highway opened in 1997. In 1999, in order to address an $11-billion deficit, the Conservative government leased the highway for 99 years to a private operator, in exchange for $3.1 billion. In 2013, the 407 ETR reported revenues of $801.2 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $664.8 million. It’s a goldmine, a long, linear, wide goldmine.", "In 2012, as part of the budget bill, the government enacted the Highway 407 East Act to govern the eastern extension of the 407 currently under construction. The new “public” 407 East toll highway will be a P3, operated and maintained for 30 years by mostly the same private companies that run the 407 ETR. Under the agreement between the government and the private operator of the 407 ETR, the registrar of motor vehicles is required to deny licence plate renewals after being notified by the 407 that a driver has not paid their bills.", "Collection tactics of the 407 have become quite ruthless. They’ve fought controversial court battles, seeking the right to collect 15-year-old invoices from drivers, including the legally bankrupt, while charging exorbitant compounded interest rates. In some cases, these drivers may have long since forgotten the invoice, assuming they even received it—and one can’t be sure they received it—and are shocked when their licence plate renewal is suddenly denied by the government for failure to pay an old bill that may have ballooned to 30 times the amount of the original invoice after the interest is added on.", "Under the legislation, the 407 may notify the registrar after a bill has been unpaid for 90 days, but is not obliged to. The 407 charges annual interest rates of over 25%—amazing. Over 25%. They could be running credit card companies.", "A court has ruled that the statute of limitations for collecting unpaid toll bills applies only after the registrar has been notified, allowing the 407 the option of delaying notification while piling up interest charges. In some cases, toll charges were mistaken or were incurred by long-dead parents or ex-spouses.", "When the Highway 407 East Act was enacted in 2012 as part of the budget bill, the NDP demanded amendments that would require the registrar of motor vehicles to notify drivers via registered mail or bonded courier that their plate renewal was about to be denied. This was to guarantee proper notification in cases where the 407 invoice had gone to the wrong address or had somehow been diverted from the true private owner.", "The bill before us, Bill 31, removes this notification requirement. Why would we do that? People can be stuck with bills on which the interest rate is 25%. The company is not required to deliver that invoice in a secure manner, thus opening people up to huge liability for bills that have compound interest set at 25%. It’s extraordinary. It is extraordinary, Speaker.", "Another element in this bill relates to Serco, the privatized company that does driver’s licence examinations. They were on strike in 2009. At the time, I was the critic. I talked about how the contracting out of Serco had led to huge problems with the public, and it had. In November 2014, the Star reported that Serco’s new contract allows it to self-police and self-report, and these reports are kept secret. The Star reported on loopholes that allowed unregulated licence mills to train truck drivers with no ministry oversight. That could have been corrected with this bill, and it has not been. That needs to be amended." ],

It seems to me—and I’ll have to go back and look this up—that the path to privatization of 407 actually began with the NDP. There was something the NDP did in this regard. I’ll go back and look at what it was. I remember I was questioning it at the time, surprised that the NDP would do it.", "But they didn’t sell it. I’m glad the member mentioned in his speech the sale of Highway 407, essentially a fire sale, as he will recall, because they wanted to show a balanced budget. This is what happens when governments fall over themselves trying to find a way to artificially balance a budget. In 1999, going into the election, they wanted to show that they could balance a budget, so they had a fire sale. A European country bought it and has been making money hand over fist ever since. The member was correct when he said that: They’ve been making money hand over fist ever since.", "I always wanted to see an investigation of this, because I always hear about government records. I think what happened was that all the records about this sale went into the shredder when the previous Harris government left office. You will remember this, Mr. Speaker. The shredding machines were going—they were burning out outside the building. So we don’t have any record of it, except people do know that the Conservative government sold Highway 407 for a song.", "Now the money from the tolls on the extension is going back to the taxpayer and will be able to provide services, instead of going to some foreign company." ],

The Auditor General had noted earlier that the ministry does not practise adequate oversight of the process of commercial vehicle inspection, and now they’re talking about transferring this responsibility to a private sector operator, which will only reduce accountability and transparency for the citizens of this province.", "We also know from the experience of Serco, who operate the driver’s licensing system, that there are huge safety risks that are associated.

Some 45% of drivers who have been killed in Ontario were found to have drugs or a combination of drugs and alcohol in their system. These statistics are dreadful. Drinking-and-driving fatalities account for nearly one quarter of all road fatalities in 2011. From 2008 to 2012, 14% of convicted alcohol-impaired drivers were repeat offenders.", "Furthermore, on the issue of distracted driving: Everybody is busy these days. Nobody takes the time to just be responsible in a vehicle and focus on one thing, and that is driving. When we’re behind the wheel, we’re behind roughly 2,000 to 2,500 pounds of steel.

Distracted driving has now passed both speeding and impaired driving as the leading cause of death on provincial highways. I don’t want to just take away from distracted driving for a moment, but I might add that there’s a certain leader of the Liberal Party at the federal level who is talking about legalizing marijuana. That’s only going to perhaps increase impaired driving on our highways, but you see, he’s actually working for his Liberal cousins: With the increased fines, he’s helping them do something about this tremendous debt they have us in right now.", "Back on the element of distracted driving, penalties for using handheld devices while behind the wheel will be raised from between $300 and $1,000 from the current fine range of $60 to $500. We welcome these changes. Distracted drivers put countless others at risk every day in communities across our province, and more must be done to tackle this issue.", "However, many critics are left wondering why, after numerous indications that upcoming legislation would introduce demerit points, there’s no mention whatsoever of demerit points in this particular bill. “Let’s up the fine, but oh, don’t worry about the demerit points.” Instead, the minister can bring in—yes, here we go—regulations to perhaps implement demerit points at a later date.", "Our October 22 BlackburnNews in London published an article with the title “Distracted Driving Changes Not Enough.” In the article, Bill 31’s curious lack of distracted driving demerit points was, in fact, questioned: “As the province pushes to increase fines and add demerit points to the record of those convicted of distracted driving, local police do not think it will deter people from texting and driving.", "“As of right now, there are only two provinces in the country that do not have demerit points attached to a distracted driving offence, and”—by the way, Speaker, coincidentally—“Ontario is one of them.”", "That’s something that police forces, safety advocates and citizens are calling for. The opposition has indicated support on this as well, so let’s get it done.", "Bill 31 does not simply look at regulations around automobiles, either; it also looks at bicycle safety laws. Some may think that bicycle safety is only a big-city issue, but it is a concern for all cities of all sizes as well as rural towns. My riding of Chatham–Kent–Essex is, in fact, no stranger to tragic bike accidents. Leamington residents remember the summer evening Kyle Peters, only 15 years old, was struck and hit by a car. That is a parents’ worst nightmare. No matter how safely a child operates their bike, one distracted driver is all it takes. As a legislator and parent, and now grandparent, I cannot stress enough the importance of wearing a helmet and installing lights on your bicycle if you plan to ride in darkened conditions.", "Bill 31 would see the repeal of a $20 fine for failing to have lights on before dawn or dusk. I would suggest, then, that anyone watching or listening today take that $20 and go out and purchase a set of lights for your bike. Your safety is paramount. You can save your life with less than $20. I think everyone can agree that that’s a great investment.", "With more and more distractions at the hands of drivers, you can never know if the car that is coming up behind you is aware that you are there. Please, make yourself as noticeable as possible and practise caution. My wife and I go out at night and we bike, and we make sure our lights are in working condition and they’re on for our own safety as well as letting oncoming traffic know we’re around.", "Speaker, I’d like to highlight an area of the bill that I feel my constituents would be interested in. If Bill 31 is passed, it would require all drivers to move into another lane when approaching stopped emergency vehicles and tow trucks with flashing lights. Each week, I drive between Chatham and Toronto along the 401 and I pass countless emergency vehicles and tow trucks. I’ve seen far too many close calls where drivers pass these cars at a high rate of speed only a few feet away. I would like to commend my colleague the member for Simcoe North who brought this issue to the government’s attention with his “slow down, move over” private member’s bill. Good ideas are non-partisan. It’s a welcome sign that this government is listening to some of the good ideas that the opposition has been suggesting, and I hope that they continue to listen.", "Both pedestrians and drivers will be responsible for safety at crosswalks. Pedestrians must not enter a crosswalk if a car does not have time to stop, making both the driver and pedestrian lawfully responsible for the safety of pedestrians. I don’t know how many times I’ve seen pedestrian crosswalk lights flashing as someone is about to cross, and I see an oncoming vehicle and it appears to me that they’re not going to stop and I honk my horn and point up at those lights. This has happened several times, where I’ve tried to bring it to the attention of the oncoming drivers. But if you get hit by a car, it would be a small consolation that you may or may not have had the right of way. So, pedestrians, be careful out there.", "New subsection 7(12.0.1) of the act provides that if a pedestrian is in default of a payment of a fine imposed for a traffic or parking offence, no permit held by that person shall be validated and no permit shall be issued to that person until that fine is paid. What this means is that municipalities would be given the power to withhold licence renewal until unpaid fines are paid. For too long municipalities have been forced to wait for these powers to be granted by the province while watching millions and millions of fines go uncollected.", "So if you get a speeding ticket, the province is able to deny your licence plate renewal if you do not pay the fine. This has been the case for many years. It only seems fair to grant a similar ability to municipalities, especially since they’ve been calling for this for some time.", "The municipality of Chatham-Kent in my riding has been facing a multi-million dollar infrastructure deficit for years now. Roads and bridges that desperately need maintenance are left alone because there’s simply not enough funding in the municipality. Increased fine collection revenue will help, but on its own it will not be enough to tackle the growing infrastructure deficit.", "Even with a slight tax increase in their new budget, council is unable to keep up with our community’s infrastructure repair costs. Our tax base has been absolutely devastated during the reign of this Liberal government, as we’ve lost over 10,000 jobs in the last decade. Manufacturing is almost a thing of the past in the tremendous riding of Chatham–Kent–Essex.", "You can have all the safety regulation in the world, but if the roads themselves are unsafe, the drivers of this province will, in fact, be put in danger. Cyclists and pedestrians will, in fact, be put in danger as well.", "For Ontario’s roads to be truly safe, much more must be done.

A few years before that, there was an explosion of a propane centre east along the 401, I think near Bowmanville, that had propane tanks raining down on the 401. Luckily no one was hurt. After Sunrise, when the bill was brought back for amendment, I asked: “How many times do we have to have propane fuelling centres blow up before control over this regulation is brought back into the hands of the government? Why is it being allowed to reside in private hands?” Well, I guess we’ll have to have another explosion before we have an answer to that.", "In this bill, we have the opportunity to assert public control over motor vehicle inspection and over driver testing.

I guess the point I’d like to make on that is that if this government is, in fact, willing to hike the fines paid by Ontarians who fail to drive safely and make the roads more dangerous for drivers, will the government consider any punishment for the Minister of Transportation, whose ultimate failure to get the roads clear and ice-free perhaps led to dangerous driving conditions for thousands of drivers?

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to rise and speak about this bill. I think we’ve all said pretty clearly on the opposition benches that we’re generally supportive of this bill, with some major concerns. I just want to hearken back to my friend from Toronto–Danforth, who talks about the race to privatization and to P3s generally. We’ve seen, because of the Auditor General’s report, the danger in that, the $8.2 billion worth of danger in that.", "Actually, just a week ago, there was a huge demonstration out in the front from our brothers and sisters in OPSEU about just where you end up when you begin to privatize. It hasn’t worked. It doesn’t work. It won’t work, and Highway 407 is a perfect example of why it doesn’t work. That money could be flowing into our coffers.", "I also heard from the member from London West about the concerns over the delays and the time it takes to get your licence reinstated. This is something all of our constituency offices face. We’ve all had those calls. People need their cars in order to work. They need their cars for mobility. Cars are not a luxury for many people; they need them. So four to six weeks without one is a problem, and that has to be addressed.", "I also, as the urban transportation critic, have asked the Minister of Transportation for a very simple set of facts. I asked back in the summer—I first met him back in June. I asked, for MoveOntario 2020, when are the projects rolling out? How much will the projects cost? Where will the projects be? I have yet to receive an answer. I think that’s a problem. MoveOntario 2020 was decided under the era of Dalton McGuinty here, and we still don’t have facts about the rollout of the projects. We need those facts. I need those facts, as an urban transit critic, and I think Ontarians need those facts. They need to know where all that money is going—where it’s coming from and what it’s going on. So that’s important too.", "I, of course, am thrilled, and the member from Eglinton–Lawrence mentioned this, that the one-metre rule is finally in place in this bill. I have to say it goes to the Premier, who was then transportation minister, who at the time that that bill was tabled said, “It wasn’t well thought out.” It’s nice to know that she has changed her mind and that she admits she made a mistake, that in fact not only was a bill well thought out, but it’s now incorporated into the government bill. So that’s good.", "The problems, of course, are in the details. But before I get to that, I want to start with the big picture, because I am the urban transit critic for the New Democratic Party, and I want to talk about what a city would look like with safe roads. We have examples. We’re not speaking about utopia here. If you go to Scandinavia, if you go to most European capitals, you will find something you won’t find in Toronto. You will find designated cycle paths. I know my friend from Burlington, who used to be with Share the Road, and Cycle TO have called for designated cycle paths. Now, we’re not talking about lines on the street. The number one reason people do not bike in Toronto is because they don’t feel safe, and quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, they’re not safe. They are not safe; hence the one-metre rule. There’s a little bit of wiggle language around that, which I’ll get into in a minute, which I’d like to change and which needs to be amended. But a healthy city, a safe city for transportation, is a city where people can cycle safely. That’s number one.", "Number two: It’s a city that has a transportation system that is well funded. We have the worst-funded transportation system, talking about other levels of government, in all of North America. We used to pay 50% of the operating costs of the Toronto Transit Commission right here in the provincial government. That’s back in the days when the NDP was in government. Then, of course, the Conservatives came in, and the Liberals continued the tradition of downloading the costs of running the transportation system.", "We can see the result of that. The result is people waiting for the bus in minus-23-degree temperatures. We see people who can’t afford to get on the bus because the fares are high. We see the problems, the problems of not putting money into infrastructure in Toronto for a long, long time. Two levels of government are guilty of that: this one under the Liberals and, of course, Ottawa under the Conservatives—both levels of government. We need a national transit strategy and, my goodness, we seem to need a provincial one too, because we haven’t seen that strategy rolled out.", "A healthy, safe city, where transportation is concerned, is a city with transportation where you don’t need to take your car. You don’t need to take your car to drive around Toronto.", "I know TTCriders—I want to give them a shout-out—and all of those good people, and the Ontario Clean Train Coalition, all of those folk who are working—because that’s the other thing that this government is doing: They’re going to be running a Union Pearson Express that’s going to be diesel. Only Bangladesh is buying diesel equipment. That’s the only city in the world, outside of us, that is investing in diesel right now. It will be running past my constituents’ backyards, the member from York South–Weston’s backyards, the member from Trinity–Spadina’s backyards, and others, and schools, polluting the air, and will not provide transportation. Here’s a multi-million dollar operation that could provide transportation if it was electrified, if it had multiple stops and if it tied in to the Toronto transit system, coming from Union all the way up to Pearson. That could be transportation. It won’t be transportation. Again, we have a safety problem. We have a safety problem, and the safety problem is also environmental safety, which hasn’t been mentioned, I think, too often. Environmental safety means keeping cars off the road when you can and where you can.", "I’ve only got a few minutes. Into the nitty-gritty: Although I was happy to see the one-metre rule—my bill; our bill—finally put into action here, sadly, the language they use is “as may be practicable” instead of the language used elsewhere in the act: “unless the driver first ascertains that it can be done safely.” Why not use clear language?", "Here’s a bill that fines a cyclist $500 if they don’t have a light, but $500 is what the fine is if you kill a pedestrian. Where is the justice and the logic there? It’s $500 for not having a light on your bike, which I agree you need—no doubt—but $500 for a fine for killing a pedestrian in a car? Something is wrong there. Clearly, amendments are needed.", "Privatization: We need amendments. This is a privatizing bill. We need to change that. We need to change the language.", "Another thing we need to do—this killed a cyclist who taught at Swansea Public School, and I will dedicate this to that memory—and which MP Olivia Chow brought in, is to mandate truck side guards. This was Olivia’s federal bill—could have been done here; needs to be done here. This is the one opportunity when it could be done—yet another amendment that needs to happen.", "Just to conclude—my goodness, 10 minutes goes fast—shout-outs to Cycle Toronto, shout-outs to Share the Road, shout-outs to TTCriders, shout-outs to the Ontario Clean Train Coalition; shout-outs to all of those people who try to make our roads safer.", "Yes, while we will support this bill, my goodness, it needs amendments. It needs amendments in the language, it needs amendments in the fines structure, and it needs huge amendments, as the member from Toronto–Danforth pointed out, to the drastic privatization. This is kind of Drive Clean on steroids; that’s what this bill is. For anybody who has heard about the Drive Clean mess-up, you’ll know that this isn’t going to correct it.", "Do we really want more 407s in our future? No, we don’t, so we need to amend that part of this bill too.", "Of course we need and want safer driving conditions, and higher fines for those who text or drink or drug while driving. That’s important. Demerit points: important.", "That’s what this Legislature is for. Let’s please, around this Legislature, come together to put forward amendments, treat them seriously, take them seriously, to pass them. Then we’ll have a really good piece of legislation. That’s what I think we should all be aiming for, and that’s what I know, in the New Democratic Party, we’re hoping for." ],

More than half of the members here have already spoken to the bill in one form another, be it in debate or in questions and comments, which is their privilege. But there seem to be a couple of recurring themes here. The members are all saying the same thing. As well, I’ve stopped really hearing anything new, and I also gather that everybody is going to support the bill. If everybody is going to support it, and we’re more or less saying the same thing, rather eloquently summed up by my colleague from Parkdale–High Park, why don’t we get this bill to committee where we can actually make the changes that the members have been asking about?", "We’ve all agreed that perhaps some tweaking and some testing by bringing it out and having people come in and talk to us about the bill would help. I happen to agree with that. I think the place where we should now take this bill for further consideration isn’t in the Legislature, where we’re going to continue to hear versions of much the same thing—we’re well into the law of diminishing returns—but let’s get it to committee, where people can come in and give us some serious proposals on it, and where we can perhaps make any amendments that may be needed.", "Speaker, let’s sum it all up: We all agree we’re going to support it.

Certainly, in an area like the Bruce Peninsula, we have a lot of cyclists and we have a lot of opportunity for tourism with those types of things. I certainly have tried, since I’ve been here for my three years, to lobby that any stretch of road going in new should allow that extension so we can have that safety for our cyclists, to accommodate them and to encourage tourism in areas like Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. I certainly hope this government will continue to do that.", "It brings up the issue, though, that I had a private member’s transportation resolution on here over a year ago that all three parties unanimously supported and this government hasn’t brought anything out with it. My concern is that that would be one. The gas tax was talked about earlier—my colleague John Yakabuski raised that—and again, unanimous support and there was nothing done with that to ensure that that money would be shared across all municipalities.", "I want to go back to the paved shoulders a little bit. I believe that my colleague Norm Miller, from Parry Sound–Muskoka, brought that in. It’s good to see that at least that piece of his private member’s bill is going to be brought into this bill so that we can actually see it happen in the future. He’s going to be bringing a bill here this Thursday, I believe, Bill 58, and it’s going to extend the definition of ATVs. It’s good, again, that these things are being brought.", "What is relevant here is that there’s a small little piece of this bill that is going to remove the low-pressure tire requirement. I can’t understand why any government would have put that in there in the past—why you would ever get that down into the weeds. But the good news is that that’s going to be brought out. I think Norm is going to bring a really good bill. ATVs, again, are a great form of transportation. It needs to be something in areas like Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound so that people can get from one piece of property to another. They need to be able to go on the highways and allow those people to do as they need for both recreational and work purposes.", "It’s all about safety at the end of the day. There are lots of amendments I’d still like to make. Mr. Delaney wants us to get this to committee, but we’ve taken things to committee before and we couldn’t even get the speakers, like Laura Miller and Peter Faist, to come to some of those committees. So we’d like to get it there and make some amendments when we have the ability." ],

In my short tenure in Toronto for the last few years, I’ve had the pleasure of driving on the streets of Toronto, and I can tell you right now that the cyclists and some pedestrians—not all cyclists—are not following the rules of the road and neither are some of the drivers. I’ll tell you that I’ve been in a car on some of the main streets in Toronto when a cyclist will go up the middle between two rows of cars and wonder why they get hit, or they’ll sit at the stoplight in front of you when they want to take off at a slow rate, causing further possible vehicle collisions. They will turn right on a red light without stopping. They will go through a red light. So the education of the cyclists—and, mind you, there are a lot of good cyclists who follow the rules, but there are a lot of bad ones, just as there are bad drivers and good drivers.", "But the problem in Toronto is enforcement.

We see this on Toronto streets, Mr. Speaker. Every single day, he drives away, he comes back, he parks overnight. Come on. He knows that these tickets will never be enforced.

This is where we’re supposed to bring our thoughts and interests from our residents and our constituents whom we have the privilege of representing. I find it interesting that when it’s convenient, they don’t want to have any discussion in here. They wanted to have something like the transparency and accountability act time-allocated and yet here they just want to rush through and get everything out of debate again. We’re going to talk about a few of those.", "The first one that I find very interesting is distracted driving. I do agree that it’s becoming more and more of a concern. There are stats out there that show—I believe the Ontario Provincial Police cite distracted driving as a causal factor in 30% to 50% of traffic collisions in Ontario. So it is something that we need to all be aware of. We need to be finding ways that we can limit that. In this case, what they’re suggesting is that distracted drivers on cellphones will face maximum fines of $1,000 and three demerit points. I certainly support the fines. It is something where people are endangering other people’s lives as well as their own. They’re putting people on our highways at risk, so there have to be some teeth to the law.", "I want to recognize my colleague and former MPP John O’Toole for actually pioneering distracted driving legislation over 10 years ago. Johnny was always ahead of the curve, and in this case he was yet again. He brought in his private member’s bill to talk about distracted driving back then. It’s sad that it has taken 10 years for it to finally be implemented, but this seems to be the way with a lot of things with this government. If it’s not related to spending and going into debt or deficit, they really don’t speed things along. He was certainly the first to recognize that using a cellphone while driving had become a common practice and it needed to stop.", "The concern I have with the bill, Mr. Speaker, is that it talks about demerit points in here, but there’s nothing really in the legislation in a detailed manner that suggests what’s going to happen or what the penalty for those will be, and they talk about doing that through regulation. It just worries me, with this government, when they won’t bring things in this House for all of us, all 107 democratically elected people, to have those discussions, that they want to hide it back in regulation, which means they really have a blank cheque. I think my colleague Michael Harris from Kitchener–Conestoga, the critic for transportation for our PC caucus, said in his opening remarks that he’s concerned about the devil in the details. We don’t always see those, and we know what has happened in certain cases when that’s happened before. Then we spend onerous amounts of time, energy and resources to actually try to fight after they’ve enacted it into law.", "The Green Energy Act would be one of those things that they steamrolled across the province. They placed them in places where nobody really wants them and now we’re fighting tooth and nail to try to restrict them and to claw back, which is very challenging.", "I would like to see more detail. Certainly I would like to understand what that demerit point is. Everyone, I think, has concluded that demerits are a good way for people to be cognizant; there is a concern there are teeth to the law and we need to look at that a little bit more closely to ensure that there are going to be demerit points included in this and what that detail is.", "Another piece of the legislation that I find positive is emergency vehicles and tow trucks. All drivers must slow down and move over when approaching a stopped emergency vehicle with flashing lights. Earlier this afternoon, I talked about rural Ontario, where we have volunteer fire department personnel that actually have a green flashing light in their window. Again, we want to ensure that that is the case. Garfield Dunlop brought up his private member’s bill to try to help with that as well. We certainly support enshrining the safety precautions of this piece of the legislation.", "One thing that has come up in my riding, though, and I brought it to this House before, is that snowplow operators, in a case where there are closed roads, aren’t covered by insurance, and in fact, they can’t go on those travelled roads. So it’s a little flaw in the legislation there. How do they get out to plow the roads to make them passable and safe for others if there’s legislation that prevents that from happening? I think that’s one that we want to ensure we can actually bring to fruition again. It could have perhaps been included in this bill, had the minister listened to my concerns seriously, so these snowplow operators won’t be forced to break the law by driving on closed roads to get to their plows during a storm and then get home again afterwards. They are the first people out. I’m going to continue to push the minister to take a look at that. Perhaps that can be something I can at least get through at the committee level to enhance and improve that piece of legislation. It is something I hope the minister will look at.", "Municipal powers: Right after I got elected, I had one of my constituencies, one of the regional governments in my area, county government, call me and ask about unpaid fines. In 2011, over $1 million—I believe my colleague from Sarnia, Bob Bailey, said that in his riding there is about $1 million in unpaid fines. I trust that’s the way across the province. A lot of us have the ability to collect those fines, which could be put into things like roads, bridges, any municipal infrastructure we all need more money for. This legislation should hopefully be able to help that.", "It looks like what they’re going to do is finally listen. Again, this was from at least as far back as 2011. About one third of these unpaid fines in municipalities are related to the Highway Traffic Act, according to a study published by the Ontario Association of Police Services Boards. It would be a good way to allow municipalities to recover that. I think what they’re suggesting is that you will not be able to renew, for example, your driver’s licence sticker if you have unpaid fines left there.", "There’s a lot of time and energy spent on these things. You would think, with today’s technology, that that would be something pretty easy to record and very simple to implement; and if you don’t pay your unpaid fine, you don’t get your driver’s licence. That would be something that certainly makes sense and is a realistic way to move forward.", "Medical reports: In this case, what they’re suggesting is that it will require more medical professionals to report a driver’s health condition to the province. The concern I have here is the impact on people in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound and, of course, those across the province, where the car is the only means of transportation, especially if the condition is misdiagnosed or information is miscommunicated. Losing your licence in a place like Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound is the most punitive measure, because that is your ability to get to jobs, to get your family to medical appointments, to get yourself to those types of medical appointments.", "The concern that we have, particularly in the case where it’s been misdiagnosed or there’s misinformation, is going through all that rigmarole to try to get that licence back, and the cost, the lost wages, the impact to that family—not just the driver being impacted, but the family—and their ability to provide income for their family.", "I said here briefly a little bit earlier, in one of my feedback sessions, that about a year and a half ago, I introduced a private member’s resolution for public transportation for rural and northern Ontario. Many of our areas do not have public transportation. That private member’s resolution was passed unanimously in this House in November 2013, yet I’ve never heard anything from the government in power, the Liberal government, actually talking to me about how we move forward with that, how we enact it, how we at least have a discussion about it to try to find ways that would help the transportation concerns and needs of those in a rural area or in northern Ontario. Certainly, it’s something that I’m concerned about.", "The anti-poverty task force came out very strongly in support of my resolution because they saw the detrimental impact not having public transportation can have in an area like Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound—people not being able to get to work, not being able to get to volunteer opportunities, not being able to get to medical appointments. I think there are some areas there that we need to look at. We just need to make sure we’re not creating bureaucracies of administration that will unduly—or even unacknowledged situations where people will be deprived of that transportation ability.", "Unintended consequence I guess is what I’m saying, Mr. Speaker. Sometimes they put these punitive types of things in that are not really designed for the person who has been misdiagnosed. It’s an awful battle. I know my constituency staff do a wonderful job working with constituents to try to move through when that type of thing happens, but it’s a long, arduous process, and those people are going without jobs, without that ability to get there the whole time.", "The vehicle inspection centres: Some are already calling this Drive Clean 2, the sequel. They’re introducing a new mandatory inspection and fee program. The concern is that this could just be a government that’s in trouble financially trying to find yet another revenue tool, as they like to call it—rather than a tax, which is what it is—to actually help them find ways to fund the things they’ve made so many promises for.", "I heard one of the more senior members in the House today saying, “Spend, spend, spend.” I’m not certain if he was paying attention to the debate or whether it just naturally comes out, but it is sadly something that is almost part of their DNA on that side of the House: spend, spend, spend. We’d just like them to actually live within their means, to spend what they have, not put us in double the debt like they have in their 10 years, not to double the deficit and spend all of that money servicing the debt payment. The $12 billion a year right now that this government spends on interest payments alone could be going to the front lines and could be going to help transportation safety, Mr. Speaker—to ensure that I stay on topic. I want to make sure I do that so I never get on your wrong side, Mr. Speaker. We want to ensure that that is the case. It is concerning that they’re going to have these illegal taxes on a system like that.", "Overall, I think that health and safety, obviously, is something I stand up and speak proudly about in this House every day. I think there are some good pieces of this bill. I do believe that there are other pieces in here that we need to look at. Certainly, that demerit point, as I mentioned before, is one of those that I want to take a secondary look at. I want to ensure we have true teeth so that people can do it.", "Those unpaid fines—I think it’s great to see that we can finally help our municipalities collect those revenues that they so rightly deserve." ],

We’re proud that some of those things are included in this bill. They’re certainly great additions.", "But there are certain problems. The member talked about the vehicle inspection centre being a potential problem, and I wholeheartedly agree. I want to spend some time talking about it. We know the direction this government is taking when it comes to various areas of outsourcing services that should be done by the province but they’re outsourced to a separate entity. One of the primary problems that comes up when you outsource is the lack of accountability. We’ve seen that with respect to Serco and the privatized driver licensing system. There have been colossal problems with that system. It’s an unaccountable system and there are certainly problems. We know that that exists, so why would we then commence down a path to create more problems? These vehicle inspection centres are another example of a potential whole other suite of problems because there is no accountability.", "We know another very clear example where we have a lack of accountability and a lack of transparency, which is certainly damaging people in Ontario, and that’s Tarion. Tarion is an arm’s-length entity that is absolutely not providing the care, not providing the protection and the service that Ontarians require and deserve. In fact, Tarion is working against home owners time and time again. We need to improve from our mistakes instead of repeating them." ],

I beg to differ. Because you know what? We all have different perspectives. From an emergency operator perspective, the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound very astutely recognized that, right now, it’s against the law for snowplow operators to get to their snowplows. This is something that is absolutely relevant in rural Ontario, which perhaps the other side of the House never gets. The fact of the matter is that just last week again, roads were closed. We need people out there, and to respect what it really takes to get those emergency vehicles going and make sure the roads are open in a safe format.", "Another thing the member raised was that he brought forward a resolution in 2013 to try to find ways to address transportation issues in rural Ontario. In terms of poverty reduction, it’s a huge issue. People move out to small-town Ontario, and they don’t have the infrastructure. They don’t have the supports in place. So there are many different aspects that we need to be considering when we’re talking about not only safe roads but safe transportation in Ontario.", "When we talk specifically about safe roads, again, it’s interesting. This particular bill shows what this Liberal government is all about. It always comes back to lack of context and content. The fact of the matter is that the details are always riddled with devilish little ways to prop up their own agendas. I appreciate the comments and the member’s bringing our attention to that." ],

I will say that I commend the government for bringing it and containing it within the legislation, but there are serious ways we can actually address distracted driving.", "Based on the stats, because policies should be informed by data—if you want to serve the people best, then you should actually have good data and good information. Quite honestly, the data on distracted driving, which I don’t think the member got a chance to talk about—distracted driving charges are up 30% in my area of Waterloo region. Motor vehicle collisions because of distracted driving are up 11%. Our local police chief, Bryan Larkin, says that officers are still encountering a large number of drivers who are still using smartphones and other mobile devices while behind the wheel.", "There have been education campaigns which, in some respects, have been successful, as the member mentioned. But you need proper oversight, and you need officers on the ground. People need to understand how serious the issue of distracted driving is. As we commute, a lot of us spend a lot of time in cars. You can see people who consider their cars to be their offices because they’re stuck in their cars for so long because we have such terrible gridlock in the province of Ontario. So we’re looking forward to actually addressing the safety component of this legislation when it does get to committee, but I’m looking forward to the debate here in the House this afternoon." ],

It is an amalgamation of two bills introduced in the previous Parliament, as well as some additional measures. Regardless of whether I support the substance of the bill or not, I am dismayed by the continuing use of omnibus bills by this government. In this, as in too many matters, they seem to be taking cues from the government in Ottawa. Omnibus bills are nothing but a means to minimize the scrutiny that my colleagues and I provide to this House.", "Having said that, I would like to talk positively and constructively about Bill 31. New Democrats are supportive of the bill and its objective to make Ontario roads safer. Of course, we do have reservations about certain aspects of the projected legislation, but on the whole it is a positive and welcome development from this government. By the way, I would also like to make it clear that nobody has offered me a job for not opposing this bill.", "I don’t have time to talk comprehensively about the legislation, so I’ll address just a couple of aspects of it. This bill is especially relevant in my home city of Hamilton. Unfortunately, Hamilton pedestrians and cyclists are at a higher risk of getting hit by cars than the provincial average. There were 18 traffic fatalities in Hamilton last year, so the provisions in this bill that will enhance pedestrians’, cyclists’ and drivers’ safety are extremely important to my constituents.", "Hamilton pedestrians are 42% more likely to be injured than the provincial rate. The risk to cyclists is up to 81% higher than the Ontario average. The Social Planning and Research Council found that Hamilton is second only to Windsor for the number of pedestrians who die while walking. I do not believe that Hamilton drivers are any less careful than drivers in the rest of Ontario; instead, we most likely have a problem of poor engineering and design of our roads.", "Gridlock is a big part of the problem. It creates a situation where motorists spend half their commute crawling at a snail’s pace and the other half driving at high speed in order to make up the time they have lost. We could have safer roads if drivers were instead able to maintain a consistent and moderate speed during their journeys. Highway speeds are not appropriate or safe where pedestrians or cyclists are right next to the traffic.", "Under this bill, drivers must allow a distance of one metre “as may be practicable” when overtaking a cyclist. This sensible and potentially life-saving measure has been championed for years by my colleague the member from Parkdale–High Park.", "Most significantly, this bill ramps up the fines for dooring to a minimum of $300 up to a maximum of $1,000. Frankly, I don’t think that’s enough. Being hit by a car door is one of the greatest dangers that cyclists on our streets face. However, the cyclists have to have a responsibility in how they ride their bicycles, too, and a lot of them don’t. We do not have good data on this in Ontario, but in Chicago an ambulance was called in 50% of doorings, compared to 30% of other cycling accidents. Dooring is one of the most dangerous forms of collision, but it also is a most preventable type of bicycle-car collision.", "This increase in the fine could save lives, we hope, but alongside greater responsibilities for drivers, cyclists on our roads need to take responsibility for their actions as well. Sometimes I and many members, I’m sure, shake our heads at the lack of awareness of certain cyclists. I’ve seen cyclists on their phone; I’ve seen them eating sandwiches; I’ve seen them turning right on a red light without stopping; I’ve seen them driving up between two lanes of traffic and parking in front of the intersection, and giving us a gesture while they’re doing it. I’ve seen cyclists weaving through traffic right and left trying to speed past the right-hand side of a car that’s making a right turn. Well, I guess you’re asking for it if you do stuff like that.", "We need more understanding, more accommodation and less hostility between cyclists and drivers. It’s a two-way street, no pun intended. We need better education and training for cyclists as well as drivers. Last week, I saw a driver with a sandwich in one hand and a text in the other. I think the thing was on autopilot; I’m not sure. But the car certainly was weaving a bit, to say the least.", "Maybe the right place for this would start in the high schools or maybe grade 8, to let people know about the responsibility of taking to the roads.", "Now, let me tell you a little bit about a bad law. Right now, and this is quite bizarre, cyclists are not allowed to have a flashing red light. This will probably come as quite a surprise to more safety-conscious cyclists on our roads, many of whom are wise enough to know that a flashing red light is the best way to make themselves visible to drivers at night. This is a bad law. One small commendable provision of this bill is that it now permits cyclists to use a flashing red bicycle light. That’s good.", "At the same time as encouraging good, responsible cyclists, this bill will also punish irresponsible ones who bike at night without lights. A lot of them wear dark clothing and are almost impossible to see, especially in bad weather. If you are on the road at night in a car or truck or on a bicycle and you have no lights, you’re putting yourself and everyone around you in danger. That’s unacceptable. This bill proposes higher fines for cycling without lights—not to where I’d like to see it, but it improves it.", "We also need better enforcement by our police officers. If you run a red light on a bicycle, you should pay the same fine and lose your privilege like car drivers do after losing 15 demerit points. We should examine the whole scale of fines proposed in this bill to ensure that they correctly reflect the scale of seriousness of offences. I’ve said before that fines should be proportionate, fair and backed by evidence. I hope this is addressed at committee level.", "In an accident involving a car versus a bike, or a car versus a pedestrian, it doesn’t take a PhD to figure out who is going to come off worse almost every time. So while we need to improve the education of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians alike, we must pass legislation that minimizes collisions between motor vehicles and either pedestrians or cyclists.", "Legislation and education will not be enough, of course. As I alluded to earlier, a legacy of poor road design and engineering will need to be addressed in order to reduce the structural reasons for these collisions. Bad crosswalk designs, a lack of good sidewalks and a failure to separate high-speed vehicles from slow bicycle traffic are just a few examples of poor design that increases the rate of accidents.", "People make mistakes. We can’t engineer human error away completely but we can certainly improve it. Pedestrians will walk out without checking the signal. Cyclists will turn left without looking in each direction. Drivers will try to take a right turn without checking their blind side. We can’t engineer these mistakes away completely, but what we can do is engineer roads, crosswalks and intersections where the consequences of a mistake are much less serious, where human error is better understood and where if collisions do happen, they are at much lower speeds.", "Here in this chamber, we only have a limited and indirect influence over these things, but we can do something else. If we can’t reduce the physical consequences of collisions, we can increase the financial and legal consequences. This bill seeks to do that, and by doing so it should make our roads a little bit safer.", "A good friend of mine, the vice-president of my local union, was walking out of a shopping mall into the parking lot just a couple of months ago, when he was hit by a high-speed car. He suffered serious, life-threatening injuries and a lot of broken bones. He’s slowly on the mend and has just started to walk again. That’s how bad it was. A distracted driver hit him in the parking lot of the mall and drove him 25 feet.", "People should not be driving at high speed in a parking lot. You should not be driving in a parking lot at a speed that doesn’t give you time to react. Distracted driving is a plague in this province and quite frankly becomes a plague worldwide.", "We’ve created a society and a culture in which you always have to be available. It’s the expectation you immediately pick up the phone or answer a text, and if you don’t there’s something wrong with you. Well, last time I looked they do have technology that’s called hands-free. If you want to talk on the phone so much, either pull over or use hands-free equipment.", "Once you breed the expectation into people, they respond accordingly.

When it starts buzzing or bleeping on the highway, you look at it. Even if you don’t answer it and even if you don’t have any intention of answering, you probably still look at it, and for those two seconds, your eyes aren’t on the road. That’s distracted driving.", "If you absolutely must answer a call, you have two options: (1), Bluetooth hands-free or, (2)—and even better—pull over to the side of the road or a parking lot and deal with the matter.", "Speaker, I’ve been in this House for almost eight years now and in all that time there’s never once been a call that was so urgent I couldn’t wait two minutes to answer. Too many people in this building haven’t learned that lesson yet. I’ll make an exception for the Premier’s communication staff at the moment.

They’re only targeting B-trains, and that’s fine, but there are more trailer systems in Ontario than just B-trains, so I don’t understand why they’re just extending the B-trains. I do know, having experience with driving a truck, that if you can take those tractors and hook them on to other trailers—are they going to be illegal if you do that? Anyway, I’ve asked the member from Cambridge to look into that and she said she would.

There’s one thing in particular: We’re looking at extending trailer combinations. When I was general manager of the Ontario Dairy Goat Co-operative, we had tandem trucks with pups, we had 26,000-litre trailers. It takes a lot of horsepower to pull that type of vehicle and trailer behind.", "Looking at extending trailer combinations, we have to also address the potential impacts resulting from transports increased in size inappropriately travelling on our rural and local roadways. For instance, in our business, when we’re hauling milk during winter, especially when the frost was coming out on the roads, you can only haul two thirds of your normal weight. So now they’re taking a look at extending trailer combinations. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s going to have an impact on exactly the efficiencies of these combinations, and moreover, the impact of the weight that’s being hauled on our local roadways.", "I bring this up specifically because right now in Toronto, Good Roads and the Rural Ontario Municipalities Association are hosting their annual conference. The biggest concern over and over and over again is that this Liberal government has cut back infrastructure dollars. Rural municipalities have been struck by decreased OMPF funding, and they’re being absolutely stonewalled when it comes to applying for infrastructure dollars.", "Ladies and gentlemen of this House, we just had a member opposite talk about “spend, spend, spend.” Well, let me tell you, if you stopped, stopped, stopped your wastefulness on scandals and hiding all the absolutely dishonest things that you’re doing, maybe we’d have a little bit of money left over to appropriately invest in all of Ontario. But, no. Instead, we’re wasting dollars on Liberal scandals, which is absolutely shameful.", "Again, if we have a bill that’s talking about extending trailer combinations, we need to think about all of the impacts.

But, unfortunately, this government voted all of them down as well. They shut down opposition opportunities every chance they get.", "Another thing that I’d like to talk about specifically, in terms of making the roads safer act is pedestrian safety. There’s one element in this bill that reads that both pedestrians and drivers will be responsible for safety at crosswalks.", "It’s interesting that in the last few months that we’ve been experiencing some proactiveness in the city of Toronto with the new mayor, it has been brought to our attention that pedestrians need to be mindful of their Ps and Qs as well. For instance, when that number comes up at the crosswalk, it means that you don’t have 10 to 15 seconds to race across and hold up traffic; it means that when that hand goes up, you need to stop at the sidewalk.", "It’s interesting, because, as some of you may know, I live on a farm. Last week, I had to bring the truck into work here in Toronto. It’s a little bit bigger than most of the cars that typically use streets in downtown Toronto. The looks that I got from pedestrians because I had a Ford F-150 trying to make a left-hand turn—it was as if I was the person in the wrong. It’s very aggravating when pedestrians do not observe the rules of the road. So I think we have to, in the spirit of the making-the-roads-safer act—we need to ensure that pedestrians are held accountable for their part in making the roads safer as well.", "Another element of this bill that I want to draw attention to that hasn’t really been touched on in detail is medical reports. Time and time again, I have constituents coming to both my offices in my riding, in Kincardine and Blyth, concerned because it’s taking an extraordinary amount of time to get their licence back. Again, we have to be taking a look at efficiencies in terms of transparency and accountability. This Liberal government needs to make sure that they’re accountable to efficiencies within the system, because they’re lacking every which way you look at it. So I encourage, in terms of the making-the-roads-safer act and getting people back in a mobile position, in rural Ontario specifically—we need to take a look at facilitating and processing medical reports in a more efficient way.", "Another thing I’d like to talk about is paved shoulders. The honourable member from Parry Sound–Muskoka introduced his private member’s initiative to get shoulders paved once and for all, and we credit him for doing that. But the fact of the matter is, again, if we’re sharing the roads, everyone must adhere to the rules of the road.", "I need to make mention that in my riding, we have a situation whereby people do not respect farm implements on the road. In the spring and fall there is heavy traffic, and cottagers racing to the lakeshore or people in a hurry, trying to operate their office out of their vehicles, turn in disgust when they get held up by farm implements that have every right to be on the road. The farmers are observing the rules of the road. I think we need to make sure that when this bill finally makes it to committee, we work with our farm organizations to make sure their concerns are heard with regard to ensuring everyone is doing their part in making roads safer, because they feel they’re at risk when people do not respect their right to be on that road as well.", "There’s a whole host of things that we could talk about with regard to this bill. Recognizing that my time has quickly ticked away here, I want to touch a little bit on bicycling. As the official opposition critic for the environment and climate change, I support bicycling wherever it’s possible. It encourages active, healthy living and it reduces emissions and gridlock on our roads.", "Living in rural Ontario, I’m a driver, as are most of my constituents. But when I come to the city, I am actually taken aback by the number of cyclists who do not obey and respect the rules of the road. They are on sidewalks. They’re in bicycle lanes. They’re on your right side. They’re on your left side. They’re very, very inconsistent. While we need to be mindful of enabling more cyclists to use the road, I think we have to advocate for further education and awareness. That education and awareness points to the fact that everyone on the road is responsible for safety, both cyclists and drivers.", "In terms of dooring, bicyclists on the one hand must be aware of the vehicle’s blind spots; and on the other, drivers must be aware of the potential hazards when opening a vehicle.", "I’d like to conclude by reflecting on comments that were shared by my friend from Windsor–Tecumseh. The pushback we’re getting as we debate really does feel like a dooring. We can’t allow the government to push us aside when I, in this particular debate, have raised local issues.

Number one, clearly from the notes given out across the aisle—listen: We are here in this place to debate, and we are here to debate for a reason. I wish, as the government says, everything could be taken care of in committee, but we know the simple reality is that when these bills go to committee, the government does not take amendments put forward by the opposition seriously and does not pass amendments put forward by the opposition very often. So this is the only chance the opposition has to raise critical issues. We raise them more than once because we hope that we effect change across the aisle, we hope that they listen and we hope that they then move on the amendments, many of which have been very positive that have been suggested over here.", "That’s the point of debate: to make better legislation.

That’s why it’s important to move forward.", "I respect the member from Windsor–Tecumseh’s comments that we all have a voice, but I also think that public safety is something that is imperative for us in this House. We’ve all spoken about it. We have all been supportive of it. Many of us have put forward bills in support of those public safety measures. So we can debate about debate, and that’s great, but what we need to do is make sure that these public safety measures get moving forward. Let’s get them to committee.

They have been asking this government for so long to at least be able to have extended powers around collecting on OPP fines, because rural communities like Huron–Bruce continue to be shortchanged on the infrastructure file. They have identified this through what I think is quite an amazing system of asset management and inventory around the bridge system across rural communities.

But there are bits and pieces of it that we would like to see improved.", "For example, the minister wants to take away the public’s right to be heard—actually, to be consulted; a stronger word, I believe. What do you think, Speaker? Would you rather be heard or consulted? Right, consulted. You would rather be consulted, I would imagine, as I would. However, the minister’s priority—and I stress the word “priority” because the very first thing the minister addresses in this bill, in the very first paragraph on page i, the explanatory note to the bill, is that the minister is going to “remove the requirement that the Minister of Transportation conduct an annual review, including public consultation, on the amount of the toll for the following year” on Highway 407.", "Well, isn’t that a kick in the teeth. So much for openness, so much for fairness and transparency, and so much for representing the best interests of all the taxpayers in Ontario, many of whom would like to have a say, as they’ve had, in any increase that the private operators of the 407 say they are entitled to each and every year.", "The minister used to have a policy that just in case there was a problem in the mailing of the billing, just in case it slipped your mind or the dog ate your homework and the bill that came from the 407, you were always given a second chance, a second written notice that you failed to pay a toll when you drove on the 407. But this toll to the minister’s friends—now they are going to take these draconian steps to deny you the right to get a new registration sticker for your plate without giving you a second notice.", "Now, I don’t know about you guys, but I’ve heard time and time again, long before I ever came here, about people getting bills for being on the 407 when their car or their truck was parked in the driveway in Windsor or Waterloo or Wawa. They weren’t anywhere near the 407, but they got a bill because those plate-readers are not always accurate. They make mistakes. The numbers get jumbled. There might be some snow on the plate, some mud on the plate. So people get a bill and the first thing they do: “Well, it doesn’t apply to me. I’ll throw it away.” Well, now, if they throw it away, there’s no second notice saying, “You know, if you don’t pay this, you’re not going to get your sticker.” Right?", "No second notice: Why are they doing that? Why is the government taking away the second notice billing? I’m just guessing. Maybe, if indeed at some point in the future our friends in the government want to install some kind of a billing system for the commuter toll roads in Ontario—if they are going to do that, then maybe they won’t send out a second notice that you’re late in a payment either. So they’ll set the precedent on the 407. Why else would you deny the public’s right to a consultation on a fee and why would you take away the second notice? I don’t get it. I just don’t get it.", "Speaker, I have to tell you—it shouldn’t come as any surprise, I’m sure—that we in the New Democratic Party believe there should be a public consultation on highway tolls on the 407, and we believe you should have a second notice before you lose your right to renew your sticker because you didn’t get the bill or you forgot about it or you lost it or it went somewhere else.", "When we were starting this debate last week, the Tuesday we came back, I remember the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the member from Peterborough, was saying that when the Conservatives sold the 407, it was the biggest scandal of the 20th century. I believe the minister without portfolio, the Chair of Cabinet, agreed. Well, if that was a scandal then, this is as much of a scandal now: taking away the public’s right to be consulted on any toll increase on the 407 and stripping away the public’s opportunity for a second bill just in case that first never gets through.", "There are other things in the bill, I must say, that we will support. They make sense, are overdue and deserve to be supported because I would hope we all want to keep Ontario safe.", "I believe we in Ontario have a good reputation when it comes to highway safety. I read somewhere that Ontario roadways are the safest in North America, yet every 18 hours someone is killed in a highway accident on Ontario roads.", "Distracted and impaired drivers are responsible for most of those fatalities. You can be impaired by alcohol or drugs or a combination of both. You might be on your cellphone; you might be on your cellphone on alcohol; on your cellphone on alcohol and on drugs; and you’re asking for trouble.", "I’m all for making Ontario roads safer, and there is much to be done. For one thing, we can strip it down to the fundamentals and get involved when we talk about the design of Ontario roads, especially on the 400 series of highways. I know when you enter Ontario from Michigan in Windsor—say you come across the bridge or the tunnel and get on the 401—we have a divided highway, a cement median barrier that separates the eastbound and the westbound lanes. It’s like that all the way through Essex county right into Chatham-Kent. That is where a problem comes in.", "During the summer election last year I was in my campaign office when I had a visit from the parents of a young girl, a 13-year-old girl, who was in a car driven by her 35-year-old uncle. They were on their way to London for a family vacation. The driver of a transport truck coming towards Windsor in the westbound lane lost control, came over the centre—there was no cement barrier—and collided head-on. So 35-year-old Marc Lafontaine and 13-year-old Alyssa Smulders both lost their lives. The girl’s parents, Jason Smulders and Denise Lafontaine, agonized over it. They came to see me. I said, “I can’t make this an election issue; I can’t make you any promises.” The only commitment I can make, Speaker, was to promise to arrange for a meeting with ministry officials after the election was over, if I was re-elected. We would talk to them about highway design and whether, in fact, the ministry felt that if there was a cement barrier, those Jersey-type barriers, that would have prevented the accident.", "In October I did arrange for the meeting. The ministry officials came down from London. It was a very stressful meeting. The parents were still very upset, and I can understand that. But at the end of the day I have to commend the ministry for sending those officials down and talking to the parents, because they wanted to be heard. They wanted to voice their opinion on the design of 400-series highways. That meeting did take place. I’d just like to say they were given no assurances that designs would change, but at least they have the feeling now that the government did listen, their member did listen, and a meeting was held.", "I thank you for your time.

It’s a waste of time here today, this should go to committee.” Now that was a disgusting comment. That comment had no place in this debate this afternoon.", "I realize we all have speaking notes. We all refer to them from time to time.

The safety of our roads is excellent by any measure. By the hundreds of thousands of kilometres driven, by the hundreds of thousands of licensed drivers or by population, Ontario has safe roads, and we should commend everybody for that.", "But what we don’t have is short waiting times in our hospitals. What we don’t have is a reduced unemployment level in this province. What we don’t have is a wealth of prosperity. We have economic stagnation; high unemployment; we have extended wait times in our health care system—but we have a bill in front of the House to address a whole myriad of concerns and problems with what we’re doing well in this province. Just remember: By any measure, we have safe roads—the safest roads in the country.", "Then you look through some of the merits of the bill. I have to draw the members’ attention to page iii of Bill 31. It’s in the fourth paragraph from the bottom. I read this: “Pedestrians (which includes persons in wheelchairs) must not enter a crossover and into the path of a vehicle or streetcar that is so close that the driver cannot stop”—must not be allowed to enter the path of an oncoming vehicle that is so close, it cannot stop. Clearly, by deduction, we understand that that is an injury; that’s a collision. There’s going to be somebody injured, quite possibly fatally. What is this bill going to do to prevent that from happening? We’re going to also fine the person who has just been injured in that collision.", "Is that really important? Do you think that is going to prevent somebody from doing that after they’ve been injured, maybe very tragically injured, that you’re now also going to fine them? My God.

I have that case in my office. One of my staff members has MS. She’s about 40 years of age. She has never driven, never plans on driving, will never get a driver’s licence, but every time she goes to the physician, her physician has to report her to the MTO.", "What sort of needless bureaucracy is that, making physicians and health care professionals engage in the administration and reporting of people’s driving abilities who don’t drive?

It’s an important question. We are in a deficit position. We have a significant debt, and now we’re going to have a director general of stickers. I’d like to know how much the stickers and the director of the stickers are going to cost us. I hope it doesn’t infringe or impede upon the minister’s fantasy world of reducing the budget and eliminating the deficit by 2018, but we don’t know because we just don’t know how much the bloody stickers are going to cost us.", "We can go on and on through this bill.

You would think now, after this period of time, we would be living in Eden or Shangri-La or Utopia with all the legislation that has been brought forward to remedy the ills of our province. But then you see this bill where we’re actually maybe creating some new ailments with the new director of vehicles and stickers, or creating needless additional paperwork for our health care professionals to report about a driver who doesn’t drive but may have a condition that may affect their driving when they’re not driving.", "I would ask the Liberal members to ponder that for a moment. Why have we not got Utopia here yet with all the legislation? We should be on the Big Rock Candy Mountain or something if their legislation was indeed effective and good. But more often than not, it’s window dressing. Much like the distracted driver, it’s distracted legislators on the Liberal bench who read from talking points, who don’t read the legislation, and who don’t understand the consequences of it.", "I put this as the final token: If all this legislation provided the remedies that it was intended to, why are all our offices continually inundated with calls from constituents who are feeling the injustice and the unfairness of the administration of government?" ],

It’s actually just a spinning of the wheels when the government comes out with these great bills that they think are going to be effective. But enforcement is the problem. They are not enforced.

The government is in a real rush to get this to committee, because they think it’s going to get them political points, and that’s fine. But the bottom line is, when we contribute something, the process slows down. It goes to committee. It dies on the order paper, because either it’s not their idea, or they want to slow it down and take the idea, or they want to soften it or change some of the amendments to suit the people who lobby them.", "Speaker, I’ve seen this from day one.

If they had a tree-planting, he wanted to be there. He wanted to take part. The kids all knew that, but one day I guess he was held up in the terrible traffic backlog between here and St. Catharines—and the Niagara area, where there should be a Via train or GO train. The principal and the teachers wanted to move this tree-planting ceremony along—“Jim’s not going to get here; we’ll just do it anyway”—and when the kids found out about it, there was a student protest. They said, “No. We want Jim! We want Jim!”", "I tell you that story because the ministry people who came travel the province and get to know a bunch of people, but they spoke very highly of the Chair of Cabinet and minister without portfolio. I just wanted to mention that. I’m sorry I ran out of time earlier during my 10-minute presentation—not that we want Jim anymore this afternoon, but they wanted him back then." ],

I’m just going to highlight a few of them.", "I did want to raise one thing, though, that was brought to our attention earlier today at the OGRA/ROMA conference. They are looking for revenue streams. Municipalities are desperate for some dedicated infrastructure funding. They’ve been playing this game right now with the ministry around who gets the money. One councillor—actually, it was a mayor—called it the wheel of fortune: how to get funding, here in Ontario, for those communities. They are really pushing for the ability to collect those OPP fines. This is a long-standing ask. It’s very rational; it’s very organized. It’s something that obviously would benefit communities across the province, and they’re quite serious about it.", "Now, they did raise one issue—and this will lead to my next point—that in order for that to be a successful endeavour for municipalities, it would need the computer systems in the Ministry of Transportation to be able to communicate with the computer systems in the Attorney General’s office. I think we can all acknowledge, or we should acknowledge, that this government does not have the best record on computer systems and technology, if you look at SAMS, if you look at eHealth, if you look at the five-year delay for Children and Youth Services with the CAS system to consolidate one central database that keeps track of vulnerable children in the province of Ontario—you’ve pushed that date to 2020. I think those city councillors and those mayors who are down at the Royal York right now raise a really good point that if that moves forward, and when we get to committee with this, you need to be sure that whomever you employ to design the system has the knowledge to do so. I would suggest, respectfully, that you not outsource this; that you actually rely on the very good people who work here in the Ontario public service for the province of Ontario, unlike what you did with the SAMS program, where you’ve now hired another specialist to investigate yourselves in some regard.", "I told the mayors that I would bring that point here to this Legislature. They’re anticipating that Bill 31 can address this issue. Of course, I think that at one point we were actually all in agreement that this should move forward.", "I think the issue that really resonates quite strongly with us in this House is the 407 comments. My colleagues have raised some of the concerns around the lack of consultation and the debate about being heard and being consulted on 407 tolls. I think it actually warrants some attention; that has been long-standing.", "Just to remind you, obviously the 407 highway opened in 1997. In 1999, in order to address an $11-billion deficit, the PC government leased the highway for 99 years to a private operator in exchange for $3.1 billion. Even in 1999 dollars, that was a really big deal—“deal” as in a bargain. In 2013, the 407 ETR reported revenues of $801 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $664.8 million, so it was really a fairly strong revenue generator for the province, which they gave up.", "Recently, in 2012, as part of the budget bill, the government enacted the Highway 407 East Act to govern the eastern extension of the 407. Currently under construction, the new “public” 407 East toll highway will be a P3, operated and maintained for 30 years by mostly the same private companies that run the 407 ETR.", "Now, under the agreement between the government and the private operator of the 407 ETR, the registrar of motor vehicles is required to deny licence plate renewals after being notified by the 407 ETR that a driver has not paid their bill. Obviously, the second notice billing process comes into play in this regard.", "At issue here right now is the issue of consumer rights. In this instance, the consumers are the people of this province, the citizens of this province who pay for the infrastructure. Of course, I think it also warrants a second look, in that the Auditor General’s report that came out just before Christmas—I know that some people would like it to go away; they would like to ignore it. But we shouldn’t, because the infrastructure deficit, which is a very strong theme down at the OGRA/ROMA conference, is growing. Infrastructure in the province of Ontario is obviously an economic issue. It’s a driver of the economy. She raised some very good concerns that should be paid attention to. This privatization enamour continues to—this government continues to go down that road, which we obviously have raised concerns about for many years. It is not in the best interests of the people of this province.", "With this whole expansion around trying to improve safety: great. There are some good things in this bill; we fully support them. But the expansion and the acceleration of privatization around our infrastructure in this province should be a huge red flag for the people.", "I’m going to read quickly from the Globe and Mail, from Barrie McKenna. He said, “Revelations that cash-strapped Ontario may have squandered as much as $8 billion on dozens of infrastructure projects is shocking....", "“But the real stunner for taxpayers is that the province, and governments across the country, risk repeating the same costly mistakes on hundreds of future projects.”", "You can see, through the legislation, that this government is continuing to go down this path of outsourcing and privatizing, even though we now have so many well-documented examples. We have the data, and yet this government refuses to take a second look at this practice.", "Governments in Canada have become seduced by the wonders of private-public partnerships, so-called P3s, and blind to their potentially costly flaws. This is not a government that can afford to continue to waste money. In a typical P3 project, the government pays a private sector group to build, finance and operate, as explained here around the 407, everything from transit lines to hospitals, sometimes over decades.", "These projects almost always cost significantly more than if governments just put up the money themselves and hired the contractors to build the same infrastructure under the conventional contracts.

Governments can borrow money at a much more competitive rate.", "The entire direction that this government continues to go down, especially around the consultation or the lack thereof on 407 tolls, and not giving citizens of this province the ability to get a second notice around billing is obviously alarming for us.", "Now, I don’t want to debate about the debate, but before a Liberal gets up and says, “You know, there’s enough debate,” I need to tell you that this is our only chance to raise these issues. Because what happens in this new culture of this majority government, which actually is a significant shift from past majority governments, is that our voices do get shut down in committee. We bring forward very progressive amendments, well-researched amendments, and this government time and time again refuses to take those into consideration.", "In speaking to some of the people who have been here for a long time and give some historical perspective, this is a shift. It’s a shift in attitude, it’s a shift in culture that stems from a very emboldened majority government. Quite honestly, if this is our only chance to raise our concerns, then it’s our responsibility to do so.", "When it gets to committee and you shut us down, like you have done on almost every single piece of legislation, I’ll remind you that this was our only chance to raise these issues, it’s our job to communicate our concerns and, if you listened, legislation would be stronger." ],

That’s how seriously they take suggestions from the opposition.", "When we get to committee, I can tell you—I’m asking, actually: Will they actually bring in any amendments brought forward by the opposition? There’s a challenge, because their tradition has been to bring in no amendments from the opposition. So let’s hope for a change." ],

No party—Liberal, Conservative or NDP—ever dealt with this comprehensive approach to cycling safety. Some of the cycling safety measures come from the opposition.

We have to have a culture change in this province and get rid of this conflict between road users.", "I heard one member of the NDP talking about cyclists and all the awful things they do. That rant about cyclists doesn’t get us anywhere. I think we’re all guilty of not taking safety into account, whether we’re a pedestrian when we cross the road, whether we’re a cyclist and we don’t obey the rules, or whether we’re a motorist. Motorists break the rules; they actually speed. God forbid. Motorists speed in this province, and motorists drive when they’re distracted. That is a very key safety component of this legislation.", "So we’re saying, “Here’s your own medicine you prescribed. Why are you against it? Let’s get it done.

It’s true that there are some private members’ bills that are incorporated into this piece of legislation, but there are some gaps in it.

Some—not all—really good ideas are incorporated in this.", "This is the issue with the way that legislation is crafted in this place. Why not create and craft legislation right the first time?

They used to be truly consultative. They used to actually take pieces of legislation to the people up north, into the east, into the west and into rural communities.

I had an AZ licence. I’ve had that licence since 1978, when they first brought them in. I drove part-time most of the time. When I needed a bit of extra cash for the farm, I’d go out and do some trucking. Mostly it was in the livestock business that I had my experience with trucks, although I drove trains and hauled grains, soybeans and stuff like that—mostly agriculture commodities and fertilizer. So that’s what my trucking experience was.", "I might add that if you see a livestock trailer—and we call them pots most times because they had the pot-belly down, and they’re hauling cattle—I would suggest that you don’t park beside them at a stoplight. There is a reason for that. You’ll see these pots have holes in them, to let ventilation go through for the animals. If they decide to relieve themselves, it generally comes out of those holes. I’ve had occasion to see them deposit what they have gotten rid of on top of cars at different stoplights. It’s actually quite amusing when it happens to me, but certainly not to the vehicle that is being dirtied; we’ll put it that way." ],

I suppose that’s a good idea. But if a truck is just one metre away, I would suggest that bicycle may get sucked into that truck. There is quite a bit of turbulence along the side of a truck as they’re going along, and you’ll see it especially with the snowy weather we’ve had. You can see these little tornadoes at the back of the truck.", "I would suggest that it may be a good idea that truckers especially need to take extra care when they’re passing bicycles, because they will suck them right under these trailers. If they’re going at speed, certainly they only have to be a metre away, and that’s what this says. So I think there’s an issue with that.", "One of the other things I found in this piece of legislation is that it says, “Currently ... the act allows certain prescribed combinations of vehicles to have a maximum length of 25 metres. This is amended to allow a maximum length of 27.5 metres.” That’s interesting because when you look at the back of the bill, it says, “Extended length of B-trains.”", "I don’t know whether everybody here knows what a B-train is.

Most of the trucks I drove had sleeping berths on them; some were nicer than others. But I still don’t understand why it only affects B-trains. It’s not explained in this legislation.

The more you lengthen these sleepers out, the more you have to extend your frame because you still have to keep the back of the sleeper ahead of the trailer you’re pulling in order to turn. You just can’t lengthen a sleeper out; you’re going to hit that trailer. Many new owners of fifth-wheel trailers pulling along a pickup truck have found out just how they can crush the back of a truck in when they turn too short.", "Again, I get back to the A-trains, which is a different system. Why aren’t they affecting that? Because you lengthen a truck out for a B-train, it doesn’t mean that’s all he’s going to be pulling. He may have to unhook that tractor and go under another set of trains or another trailer. If the distances aren’t correct, if the pin location isn’t correct on the other trailers, he may have an issue turning.", "Like I say, I’m sure the Ontario Trucking Association has figured that out, but when you read this, it doesn’t say that. It just says that anything having to do with the B-train, we’re going to let them lengthen the tractor’s frame so that they can put more comfortable sleeping berths in for drivers.", "Some of those sleepers, if you’ve ever been in them, would have a chest of drawers. They’ve got microwaves and televisions. You could stay there for a long time. In fact, sometimes when I had been driving for a few days, that was what I would do because they’re comfortable and they’re very nice to stay in. As you may be aware, a trucker can only drive so many hours a day and so many hours a week.", "Another thing it says is that, at the same time, we are looking at extending trailer combinations. We must also address the potential impact resulting from transports inappropriately travelling on our rural and local roadways because these roads have not been built to withstand the weights some of these vehicles have.", "Speaker, in these B-trains you could gross about 64,000 kilograms. That’s your gross weight. That’s heavy. That’s really heavy. Now, if you’re hauling grain out of a farm that’s on country back roads, those roads were not built to handle 64,000 kilos of gross weight. I think most truckers try to be very careful with that. They try to get some of the grain out to waiting trailers that are out on the highway.", "I think that’s an issue that I’ve heard from municipalities since I’ve been here, and even when I was a councillor for the municipality of North Perth: These weights that are being allowed with these trucks are getting just too much for our infrastructure in rural Ontario. I would suggest that’s something that has to be looked at.", "To me, the trucking issue here has more questions than answers to it. Like I say, I do hope the member from Cambridge can find me some answers because, to me, it doesn’t make a lot of sense and I hope that what she brings back will help me out." ],

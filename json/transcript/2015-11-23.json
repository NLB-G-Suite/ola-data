Helping Ontario businesses succeed and grow helps create rewarding and high-paying jobs.", "We’ve already made great strides in supporting Ontario businesses, Mr. Speaker. Ontario’s business tax reductions have positioned our province as one of the most attractive locations in the industrialized nations for new business investment. Ontario is one of the top destinations for foreign direct investment in North America.", "The government has done a lot to get to this point. We eliminated the capital tax, which corporations paid whether or not they had a profit. This provided $2.1 billion of tax relief per year. We’ve cut corporate income tax rates for small and large businesses alike, providing another $2.3 billion of tax relief each year. And we eliminated the employer health tax for thousands of small employers in Ontario.", "All these measures promote a more competitive business climate and attract new business investment, helping to support the backbone of innovation in our economy. But the marketplace is ever-changing, Mr. Speaker, so we must continue to adapt and evolve the support we offer businesses. That’s why this government is proposing Bill 144, the Budget Measures Act, a bill that, if passed, would enact five new statutes and amend other statutes. It would further the economic plan set forth in the 2015 budget and demonstrate the government’s commitment to create a dynamic and innovative business climate, an environment that enables us to spur greater opportunities.", "The bill contains a number of significant steps as we move forward with our plan. The government is proposing to remove, for example, the debt retirement charge cost, substantive amounts that will then be released by April 1, 2018, for all non-residential consumers. That’s nine months earlier than previously estimated. It would also reduce businesses’ electricity bills. Ending the DRC on a legislated, fixed date would provide certainty to commercial, industrial and other users, to help them plan their investments more effectively.", "To further help businesses succeed and grow, the Budget Measures Act, 2015, also proposes to make amendments to the Liquor Control Act to operationalize the sale of beer in grocery stores. It simplifies rules in the Securities Act on the regulation of takeover bids and issuer bids, and it provides one-time relief to eligible Ontario interactive digital media companies.", "The bill will also move forward Ontario’s infrastructure plan by proposing amendments to the Trillium Trust Act to designate the following as qualifying assets: the LCBO head office lands, Ontario Power Generation’s head office building, the Lakeview lands, and the province’s shares in Hydro One and Hydro One Brampton. Also under the proposed amendments, net revenue gains from the sale of these assets would be dedicated to the Trillium Trust.", "Other proposed changes in the Budget Measures Act, 2015, include improving and streamlining the regulation and promotion of the horse racing industry in Ontario, amendments to the Tobacco Tax Act to strengthen oversight of raw leaf tobacco, and improving the management of corporate land forfeited to the province of Ontario.", "To give further insight into the proposed new statutes and amendments, I call upon my colleague Laura Albanese to provide this House with further details on the Budget Measures Act, 2015." ],

First, we’re looking at the cost of running a business. As you know, this government is committed to reducing electricity cost pressures on small businesses and industrial consumers.", "Previously, the government announced that it is removing the debt retirement charge from residential users’ electricity bills on January 1, 2016, saving a typical residential user about $70 per year. This new bill, the Budget Measures Act, 2015, proposes to remove the debt retirement charge for commercial, industrial and other non-residential electricity users nine months earlier than previously estimated, on April 1, 2018. This would provide more certainty to commercial, industrial and other users, and help them plan their investment decisions more effectively. This would save a large industrial company using 3,000 megawatts per month $21,000 per month, and a small business using 20,000 kilowatts per month, $140 a month.", "Second, we are proposing a number of amendments for business tax credits. For instance, the government is proposing changes to the Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit. The 2015 Ontario budget announced a number of changes to this tax credit.", "Since its introduction in the 1998 budget, interactive digital media products have become mainstream, and tax support has grown at an unsustainable rate. To better meet the needs of this growing industry, the 2015 budget proposed to focus the credit on entertainment products and educational products for children under the age of 12.", "To enable regulatory amendments, the Budget Measures Act, 2015, proposes to remove a requirement that all, or substantially all, of a product must be developed in Ontario by a qualifying corporation.", "On November 2, 2015, the Ministry of Finance released draft regulations for public comment that would replace the requirement, as well as make other amendments to the Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit that were announced in the budget.", "Third, we are looking at the business of horse racing in this province. In the 2015 budget, our government committed to enabling the long-term success of Ontario’s horse racing industry. We recognize that this industry is vital to rural communities across Ontario, and it is an important part of Ontario’s rich heritage. It supports rural jobs and economic development in the agricultural sector, particularly as it relates to the horse breeding sector.", "In June 2012, the government established a panel to determine how to best modernize the industry. After extensive consultation with stakeholders and the public, the panel’s final report, released in October 2013, included a number of key recommendations. Based in part on these recommendations, the government created the Horse Racing Partnership Plan and raised the investment in this plan to $500 million over five years. This plan will support a world-class horse racing industry in the province. This plan reflects the willingness of many in the industry to build a new partnership with government and work together to ensure long-term success.", "As part of the HRPP, the Horse Racing Partnership Plan, the government directed the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp., OLG, to integrate horse racing into its gaming strategy as permitted under existing statutory authorities. In the 2015 budget, the government committed to strategically realigning provincial horse racing regulations, adjudication and funding within the government and its agencies. That is why, Mr. Speaker, the Budget Measures Act, 2015, proposes to improve and streamline the regulation and promotion of the horse racing industry in Ontario.", "Specifically, if passed, the amendments would authorize the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. to support live horse racing in Ontario, excluding operation of a parimutuel system of betting. The amendments also authorize the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario to undertake the regulation of horse racing in the province, with the licensing adjudicative functions to transfer to MAG’s Licence Appeal Tribunal.", "OLG are experts in promoting gaming. By integrating horse racing into OLG, the industry will benefit from centralized marketing and expertise that would expose more Ontarians to this live sport.", "New provisions would also authorize the Minister of Finance to establish a grant program for the purpose of supporting live horse racing in Ontario. A transitional provision would authorize the minister to designate such a program as the successor to the Horse Racing Partnership Funding Program. This is part of our framework to support the long-term success of the horse racing industry in Ontario.", "Fourth, we are strengthening the securities sector through amended legislation.", "As you know, Mr. Speaker, Toronto is the financial capital of Canada and a leading global financial centre, recently moving up to eighth place in Z/Yen Group’s Global Financial Centres Index, and is now ranked second in North America, behind only New York. Toronto is home to many leading banks, securities dealers, insurers, pension funds and financial services firms. The financial services sector, overall, accounts for almost 10% of Ontario’s GDP and employs around 380,000 people. Ontario’s financial services sector remains the province’s second-largest sector after manufacturing, based on output. In 2014, the sector created jobs almost twice as fast as the overall Ontario economy. According to the Conference Board of Canada, 43% of Canada’s financial services headquarters employees are based in Toronto. That’s triple the next largest, which is Montreal, at only 12.4%.", "The securities sector and its regulation are very important to Ontario’s economy. Over half of the Canadian securities industry GDP and employment, and 80% of market activity in Canada, by some measures, take place in Ontario. That is why Ontario is taking a leadership role in the establishment of the Cooperative Capital Markets Regulatory System, or CCMR.", "Further to a 2015 budget announcement, proposed amendments to securities legislation would largely repeal part 20 of the Securities Act. These amendments are intended to more closely harmonize the provisions in the Securities Act with those of all other provinces and territories and with the proposed approach under the Cooperative Capital Markets Regulatory System.", "If this change is enacted, the OSC would make proposed National Instrument 62-104, takeover bids and issuer bids, a rule in Ontario, and most substantive regulatory requirements would be included in the rule. That is consistent with the current approach in all other provinces and territories and the planned approach under the co-operative system. These changes would facilitate transition to the co-operative system, and participating in the system would make capital markets in Canada safer, more efficient and more competitive.", "The proposed amendments to section 142 of the Securities Act would further extend certain exemptions under Ontario Securities Commission rules regulating derivatives markets as they apply to the crown and the Ontario Financing Authority.", "Of course, Mr. Speaker, there are other areas that we are focusing on to help grow the economy, and the Budget Measures Act, 2015, supports those areas as well.", "We continue to make investments in what matters most to Ontarians: investments in infrastructures like roads, bridges and transit. We know that modern infrastructure is the basis of a well-functioning economy and a prosperous society. It supports Ontario’s industries, creates jobs and provides long-term benefits to Ontarians and the economy. In fact, the Conference Board of Canada estimated that the province’s infrastructure investments from 2006 to 2014 would add more than $1,000 to the average annual income of Ontarians by 2014. The Conference Board also said that these investments would lower the unemployment rate by almost 1% relative to where it would otherwise have been.", "The opposite side of the coin is this: If governments fail to invest in infrastructure, economic and productivity growth slows and quality of life suffers. That is why Ontario is investing more than $130 billion over 10 years in public infrastructure projects. This represents the largest infrastructure investment in Ontario’s history. Total investments are expected to support more than 110,000 jobs per year, on average, in construction and related industries, including 20,000 jobs from investments made as part of Moving Ontario Forward.", "Excuse my voice, Mr. Speaker; I’m getting over a cold.", "Our Moving Ontario Forward plan makes $31.5 billion available over 10 years for public transit, transportation and other priority infrastructure projects across Ontario. About $16 billion will be invested in transit projects in the greater Toronto and Hamilton area and about $15 billion will be invested in transportation and other priority infrastructure projects across the province outside the GTHA.", "To support these investments, we are unlocking the value of provincial assets to help fund these necessary infrastructure investments. As you know, the 2014 Ontario budget established the Trillium Trust, an account dedicated to fund infrastructure investments from asset sales to ensure transparency. As part of the Budget Measures Act, 2015, we are proposing amendments to the Trillium Trust Act to increase that transparency. The changes would confirm certain assets included in the government’s asset optimization strategy as qualifying assets under the act, for which net revenue gains from a sale would be dedicated to the Trillium Trust. These assets include the province’s shares in Hydro One and in Hydro One Brampton, as well as the LCBO head office lands, the OPG head office building and the Lakeview lands. The net revenue gains from these assets, in turn, would be used to fund infrastructure projects that will create jobs and strengthen the economy.", "To conclude, the 2015 Ontario budget laid out our government’s vision to make the necessary investments in modern public infrastructure, to create an innovative and dynamic business environment, to invest in people’s skills and talents, and to build a strong and secure retirement income system. The Budget Measures Act, 2015, proposes changes to further this government’s four-part economic plan to build up our province. The act supports Ontario’s businesses, helping them to compete in an increasingly competitive global economic environment. It supports investments in key public infrastructure projects that will attract investment, support industry, create jobs and allow people and goods to move more freely throughout Ontario. In short, it will enable us to continue to build Ontario up. That is why I ask the members of this Legislature to support the budget measures act of 2015." ],

That’s not a lot of time to hear from the government as to what the content of the bill is and its ramifications.", "We know, in our area, exactly how people feel about this government’s initiatives when it comes to stimulating our economy and supporting good public policy. It has been lackluster at best. In fact, it has been disastrous, and it has harmed a lot of people.", "Some of the things I picked up from the associate minister: Infrastructure investments that were made over the last period of time that she indicated are said to have reduced the unemployment rate 1% lower than what they would have had they not spent money on infrastructure. It’s hilarious that that’s the claim they make, that unemployment could have been a lot worse had we not spent any money on infrastructure. “You’re lucky we even spent a dime,” is what they’re saying. Now we’re going to burn the furniture to heat the house with the sale of Ontario Hydro.", "I recall in this House—I was elected in 2011. I recall then the finance minister of the day. His name was Dwight Duncan. He was from my area, from Windsor–Tecumseh. He talked about the need to bring in the HST. Remember that, the harmonization of the GST and the PST? He claimed that it was going to create 600,000 jobs in this province. Anybody remember that, the 600,000 jobs? We have seen a massive exodus over the last 10 years, with 300,000 jobs in manufacturing alone. To claim that they’re going to support horse racing after they devastated horse racing in Ontario is another laughable prospect coming out of this government. I look forward to the debate, and I hope we hear a lot more from the government." ],

As an educator, the changes we are making in this area are very important to me. The changes that we are making in regard to contraband tobacco should help to reduce or even stop the flow of contraband tobacco to the teenagers in the schoolyards, who are currently purchasing such products.", "Other proposed changes in the Budget Measures Act, 2015, include improving and streamlining the regulation and promotion of the horse racing industry in Ontario; enhancing benefits for injured workers—I think this has been a long time coming, and it will be a great asset for injured workers—also, improving the management of corporate land forfeited to the province. This is an area that needs to be corrected, and I think we’re going to make that much better for all involved.", "I urge everyone to pay attention to this bill.

It makes you wonder what they’re trying to slide through here.", "Both the Electricity Act and the Trillium Trust Act should be pulled out of this bill and debated separately. These are very significant, substantive measures, and we need to understand that and be able to have the opportunity to debate and hold them to account.", "In regard to the Electricity Act, the Auditor General confirmed in 2011 that the government had collected enough money from the debt retirement charge to remove that charge from Ontario’s hydro bills, yet this Liberal government has chosen not to remove that until 2018. So a government that has had all this time, 12 years, to do that are telling us it’s paid off—but I’m not certain that the people of Ontario truly trust that they have. Otherwise, why would they not take it off right away?", "The other thing I’m concerned about is where they actually have the ability to utilize this money. They’re suggesting that the money could go into the Trillium Trust, but there’s a loophole that allows only a portion of the proceeds to actually go into the Trillium Trust. That allows the government to use it wherever they want, to be able to make themselves look good—particularly, I trust, in 2018, as we get close to budget time. Mr. Speaker, it’s inappropriate.", "The money from the sale of Hydro One originally was in legislation that said it had to go to paying off that debt. They’ve had their 12 years. They’ve continually added to those debts across our province. And yet, here’s a chance, when they actually are doing a fire sale, nonetheless, to take that and pay it all down, as opposed to putting it into things that they will use for their own self-serving purposes.", "So I’m very, very concerned, as I believe the people of Ontario would be concerned, with this government and how they’ve managed debt till now; that they’ve actually not taken the opportunity to pay down that debt, which would allow us to do a lot of different things across our province, and particularly not spend so much on interest payments." ],

The Auditor General said, back in 2011, that the government had collected enough money from the debt retirement charge to remove the charge from Ontario Hydro’s bills. Let me just repeat that. I was brand new. I came in in October 2011, and the Auditor General brought in a report a month later. I was energy critic at the time, and I sat in the media room for the first time and listened to the Auditor General. It was the first time I had seen an AG’s report. The auditor—“he” at the time—said to the Liberal government, “You have already collected enough money. So where did the money go?” I remember he asked the finance minister, Dwight Duncan at the time, “You have three months to bring me a report to show me where the money went, because you’ve collected”—at the time it was about $8.7 billion, and the debt was $7.8 billion. So he asked, “Where did the extra billion go?” Minister Duncan left; he resigned from the Legislature. So we never did get that report.", "In addition to confirming that there had been enough money collected in the debt retirement charge, we had some other revelations. The government is confirming today that the debt charge won’t be removed until 2018. This is fully seven more years that they have been charging about a billion dollars a year, incidentally. It’s somewhere between the high $900 millions and just over $1 billion a year; it fluctuates every year. What did they do with that additional $7 billion? The Auditor General is asking, “What did you do with that extra billion?” Seven more years have now gone by, and we’re actually at $8 billion. What did you do with that money? We know it has been artificially keeping their skyrocketing deficit down in the $8-billion, $9-billion, $10-billion range with this extra $8 billion.", "When you combine the two debt terms, the government is forcing us, basically, to trust that they have paid off the debt with the revenue from the debt retirement charge. That’s what they’re saying: “In 2018—trust us—it’s all going to be paid.” But I have to ask you again, Speaker: Considering what the auditor told us, that the debt was paid in 2011 and they’re still charging the debt retirement charge every year—$1 billion or so a year—what the heck did these guys do with all of our money?", "I’m going to read—I know the member will be thrilled at this—from my January 23, 2014, Fedeli Focus on Finance, when we disclosed something that we found quite inadvertently. If you look at what the Ministry of Finance had said on August 18, 2011—this was about two months before the 2011 election—they told the public, in print, “Amount of debt to be paid off, $7.8 billion.” That’s what they told us the debt retirement charge was.", "Only nine months later, after the election, they announced—they came clean and said, the Ontario Ministry of Finance, May 15, 2012: “Amount of debt to be paid off, $11.9 billion.” Somehow the debt, which was a fixed debt, grew to $11.9 billion. So, the government—we announced this in the Legislature—secretly borrowed $4 billion against the Hydro debt, and did not tell anybody in the Legislature about it. In fact, Speaker, if you look at the annual report of the OEFC for 2004, it shows the debt at $7.8 billion. In 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011—each and every one of those annual reports—you can go online and look up what they had the debt in 2004 listed at, and it was $7.8 billion. The next year, it had gone down and gone down. But every single annual report, they show that the 2004 debt was at $7.8 billion.", "In the 2013 annual report, they restated that amount, for the first time publicly: It was $11.9 billion. So they had secretly borrowed $4 billion and never told us about it; never told us the next year, and the next year. In fact—I have to be careful with the words I want to use here, Speaker—they said one thing when the complete opposite of that was fact. They told us the debt was $7.8 billion. The OEFC printed this, that our debt was $7.8 billion. Every year, they printed that, and then, after the election, lo and behold, they corrected it and put it at $11.9 billion.", "That was bad enough, that they had been fooling us for all those years, but the worst thing is that they did something—they borrowed $4 billion and didn’t tell us—with that money. We still, to this minute, don’t know what they did with our money. But that’s why the debt retirement charge stayed on all these years. They had those extra billions to pay back that they didn’t tell the taxpayers.", "When you ask, “Where did all this money go if it wasn’t paying off $7.8 billion in the residual stranded debt?”, the auditor gave us a major clue in his 2011 report: “External legal advisers we engaged to assist us ... confirmed our view that section 85 of the Electricity Act, 1998 (Act), which is titled ‘The Residual Stranded Debt and the Debt Retirement Charge,’ allows the DRC to be used for any purpose that is in accordance with the” government’s “objectives and purposes, and not just the retirement of the residual stranded debt.” The source is the Office of the Auditor General of Ontario 2011 Annual Report, page 12.", "So now we know: They found a loophole in the debt retirement charge bill, and instead of charging the people on their hydro bills for the debt retirement charge and lowering the actual charge, they have been using all that money to help artificially lower their deficits. That’s what these guys have been up to.", "In addition, the government has made changes to the Electricity Act that take money guaranteed to municipalities and allow it to go towards balancing their budget. The government is also allowing the taxes from subsidiaries of Hydro One to go to whatever project the government wants and not paying down the $26 billion in hydro debt—so, again Speaker, here we are—which will turn out to be a case of burning the furniture to heat the home.", "We talk about that in this Legislature all the time. Let me explain a little bit about that. You have this government having a fire sale of Hydro One. They’re taking that money—they call it $9 billion; the Financial Accountability Officer says that the actual cash at the end of the day, after all expenses and the tax which is non-cash are taken out, could be as low as $1.4 billion. But let’s just go with the Liberals’ number in Liberal math to begin with. It’s $9 billion.", "So, you owe $26 billion in your hydro—you still owe that. They’re going to ostensibly sell hydro for $9 billion, put $4 billion against their deficit and $5 billion will be used to lower the debt. Speaker, we still owe $21 billion after that. We’re still going to have interest payments on that $21 billion, but now, we don’t have, first of all, the principal to apply against there, but we also don’t have the revenue coming in, every day, every week, every month, every year, from when we owned Hydro One. So, now you’ve got this debt—the only way they’re going to be able to pay for it is to raise your hydro bills.", "We know that this year, 2015, between the hydro increase on May 1, the hydro increase on November 1 and the hydro increase that will come January 1—that’s a 33% increase to your hydro bill in eight months. In eight little, short months, it’s up 33%. It’s going to go even higher now when you don’t have the revenue from Hydro coming in. The Financial Accountability Officer told us, plain and simple. If you want to do this—and he’s not agreeing that you do it—then you go borrow rather than sell. I would just advocate, lower your expenses and cut your spending, because they’ve obviously—I’ll talk about it in a little while, where this money has been wasted. So cut the waste. Cut that spending and use that method, but if you’re not going to do that, then go borrow the money, according to the FAO, because it’s far cheaper than when you sell this asset. You’re going to have a one-time payment and no revenue forever. You are putting Ontario in a much further precarious position than we’ve already seen this government put us in.", "Think about when they took office. Our debt in Ontario was $139 billion. It took 20-some Premiers 137 years to get that debt up to $139 billion, and the Liberals have been able to double it in 10 years and more than double it now in the 12 years they’ve been in power. We’re very concerned that the changes and the sale of hydro, combined with the debt, will only grow, meaning that rates will have to go up to offset the ever-growing debt. I’ll chat a bit more about that later, but I want to talk about the Trillium Trust because it’s integrated in this whole nonsense about this fire sale.", "The government claims that they’re dedicating the revenue from the sale of Hydro One and other properties to the Trillium Trust, but yet again, this act contains a loophole allowing the minister to put only—and I’ll use the word—“a portion” of proceeds to the Trillium Trust. We’ve talked about that before. Our party brought amendments at the last budget. We brought amendments when this government wanted to be able to sell an asset, and the operative words are “may” and “portion.” They “may” use a “portion” of the asset sale to put into the Trillium Trust; that doesn’t say they must put it all. So we brought amendments into committee that asked to change the word “may” to “must”: You must put the money in the Trillium Trust. Liberals voted it down. They didn’t like that “must.” They like “may” because that gives them the flexibility and the wiggle room.", "Then, instead of “portion,” we had a motion that you had to change it all. Well, the Liberals didn’t like that either because they had no intention of putting that money where it’s intended to go. So they voted that down because they wanted, as I’ll call it, the “wiggle room” again. They may call it “flexibility.”", "We brought a very simple motion that said, “Let’s let the Auditor General, within 90 days of when you sell a significant asset”—within 90 days, the Auditor General will report to this Legislature some very simple facts: What did you sell, how much did you get for it and what did you do with the money? That’s pretty simple. Again, the Liberal government voted it down. They do not want us to hear what they did with the money. They do not want that.", "What we’ve been saying all along is that the money they get from the sale of an asset will never, ever go to what they’re saying it’s going to, period. They’re going to take the revenue from the sale of Hydro One and put it towards balancing their budget, towards their deficit. There’s no hesitation for us to stand in this Legislature and say that. I’m going to prove this yet again. Our leader, Patrick Brown, has stood in this Legislature and proved it day after day, week after week.", "I will use this budget opportunity to yet again bring the facts in front, and I’ll use the Liberals’ own budget, page 45. I’ll talk to you, Speaker, about where this wiggle room is and the proof in the pudding that they have absolutely no intention of ever using a nickel of this sale of Hydro One towards what they say is transit and infrastructure. That is absolute nonsense. Not a nickel will ever go there, and I will now take the next bit of time and prove that to you.", "It has never been about infrastructure. This whole charade has never once—it’s all about scrambling, like they did with the debt retirement charge money, the $1 billion that the auditor showed us, the $7 billion that we found. It has never been all about this infrastructure. It’s all about paying for past scandals and the crippling debt, and we’ll prove that to you here in a moment as well.", "When you look at something that we saw today or that we read over the weekend—it’s brand new, Speaker. It’s called section 7, page 3 of schedule 22 of the budget document that we were handed last week. There’s a sentence here that says, as part of the authorized expenditures, “To reimburse the crown for expenditures incurred by the crown, directly or indirectly, for a purpose prescribed in paragraph 1.” There’s a little box where it gives you a little highlight and explains things to you. “Proposed section 7 of the act would specify that an amount not exceeding the balance of the Trillium Trust may”—“may,” again—“be used to fund, or to reimburse the crown....” That’s the key. That’s brand new. We now have even further proof that this was never intended for infrastructure. The infrastructure budget that they proposed was already fully funded. I’ll get to that in a moment.", "This is part of the shell game that will ostensibly put money into transit and infrastructure but take out the money that was already there.", "So this is “to reimburse the crown, for construction or acquisition of infrastructure”—and then they say infrastructure is defined in another section.", "So here we are, page 3, section 7 of schedule 22—absolute proof. This is what this whole charade of this 200-page document that they handed—again, there are some other important changes they’ve made and things they could have done over the last 12 years but never got around to doing. They’ve buried in there one sentence that is sneakily put in here—in 200 pages, several paragraphs, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of documents, and they’ve got one sentence that this is all about. It’s all to put that one sentence in there and, quite frankly, get away with it. But we read the sentence. It is to reimburse the crown for infrastructure. So now we know. It’s laid bare.", "I’ll temper myself, Speaker.", "Now we know that the Liberals are trying to get this through the Legislature, playing this shell game with the people’s crown jewel.", "Rates are going to go up. We’re not going to have any additional improvement to infrastructure to show for it.", "I want to go back to something the Financial Accountability Officer said, that our leader, Patrick Brown, has talked about in this Legislature over and over. I refer to page 45 of the budget. I took a section of page 45 of the budget out, and in the recent issue of Fedeli Focus on Finance—it was all about the facts about the sale of Hydro One.

Again, the 2015 budget, on page 45, quotes what they had presented in the 2014 budget, so I’m going to talk about that for a second. “Projected asset optimization target”—that’s their spin for the selling of the assets. In 2014-15, it’s $1.1 billion. In 2015-16, it’s a billion dollars. The next year, it’s a half billion dollars. And in the last year, it’s a half billion dollars. So they plan on $3.1 billion of asset sales, which included $1.1 billion of the General Motors shares. Excluding those shares, there’s $2 billion more over the next three years they were going to add into the Trillium Trust for infrastructure. We know that. That’s a fact. It’s printed in the 2014 budget, and it’s repeated in the 2015 budget. All of that was to fund $130 billion worth of infrastructure. That was announced in 2014.", "Again, as our leader, Patrick Brown, has stated and we’ve all stated in this Legislature many times, the $130 billion of infrastructure was set in 2014 and did not need or include the sale of Hydro One to make it happen. Now, they are introducing the sale of Hydro One and pretending that it’s for the infrastructure. But they didn’t need the money. They showed us that they did not need that money. They never listed that money. So, what is the money really for? Well, we go back to this binder where they are now allowed, when this bill passes, to reimburse the crown for construction or acquisition of infrastructure.", "Now we know. The jig’s up, Speaker. We now know that the sale of Hydro One is to pay back the crown for the money they are spending on infrastructure. It was never, ever, to be new money. They have been telling us one thing, when what we have been saying all along is absolutely true. We have laid that bare. In fact, back in April 2015, the Ottawa Citizen figured it out right away:", "“A reasonable person might wonder why we need to sell most of a significant public asset ... just to keep doing what we have been doing for years.", "“The real answer, I suspect, is that putting some billions of new money into the province’s transit trust will enable the government to quietly shift existing money to help it reduce the deficit or pay for other spending.”", "The Ottawa Citizen laid this bare back in April. We have been standing in this Legislature day after day, week after week, month after month, saying the same thing, proving that in their own budget—page 45—they showed us that the sale of the GM shares for $1.1 billion was going into the transit trust, but that only left $2 billion over the next three years to raise.", "This has all been an awful, awful shell game, Speaker, and I think that when the Financial Accountability Officer laid this nonsense in front of us, as well, he called it for what it really is: They’re broke; they’ve overspent—I’ll talk about some of the spending in the next few pages. They got caught. They can’t balance their own budget. In fact, the Financial Accountability Officer told us—after his independent report on the Hydro sale, a week later, he came out with another independent report on the state of our finances and said, “No, no. They’re not going to balance the budget in 2017-18; it will be off by $3.5 billion.”", "What they have done so far is that they’ve quietly borrowed against the energy sector $4 billion and didn’t tell us about it. I’m pretty sure that’s already frittered away, so they are digging deeper in the couch now for bigger nickels and dimes; maybe we’re up to quarters and loonies now. They are digging in the couch for money. They are going to find it in the pension tax. They’re certainly going to find it in the upcoming carbon tax. But excluding those, we now know that the sale of Hydro One—we’ve laid it bare—is not for transit or infrastructure; it is to bail them out from their deficit.", "We then move on to other areas of this presentation. We’ll talk about alcohol reform. We support greater market access and the liberalization of beer sales in Ontario, plain and simple. We always have. That being said, the government’s idea of freeing up beer sales is writing more and more regulations and rules: limits on where to sell, how to sell, how much you can sell. All they are doing is bundling this up in a big hunk of red tape with a bow on the top of it.", "The Premier called it—when she was distracting us from the sale of Hydro One with that announcement—the biggest innovation in alcohol since the Prohibition. I’m thinking, “Selling a six-pack in the corner store—this is your big deal?” Speaker, if you live in northern Ontario and rural Ontario, there are 218 places that already sell beer and wine outside of a Beer Store or a liquor store. Maybe in the GTA, you’re not aware of that. But I can tell you that if I want to drive to Nipissing township and go into Young’s general store—you can get your fishing licence there, you can gas up, get your boat oil and gas, and they also have a hand-painted sign outside that says, “Beer and wine for sale.” You can go to Young’s general store in Nipissing township and buy beer and wine today. This is not a big revelation. This is not the six-pack at the corner store that’s the greatest thing since Prohibition. The Premier said that; she said it more than once.", "North Bay, where I live, is 45 minutes from the Quebec border. We have a big company, Tembec, that’s just across the border—where there’s cheaper energy, by the way, Speaker. The 1,000 employees there enjoy that opportunity. But if you drive to Tembec from North Bay and you stop at the little corner store, the only store on the way there, in Eldee, Ontario, you can pick up a fishing licence, you can buy gas—it’s the only gas station on the way there—and again, there’s a little hand-painted sign: “Beer and wine for sale.” You can whip in there and stock up on the way to the cottage, if that’s what you want to do.", "This is no big revelation. There are 218 places like that. A lot of them are in northern and rural Ontario.

If the minister really wanted to do something, was serious about contraband tobacco, he’d put that bill within this omnibus legislation, because Todd Smith’s bill is a bill that everybody in this Legislature should get behind.", "Let’s take a second, Speaker, and talk about the motivation behind this bill, Bill 144.

I almost fell over when I heard her say that. Of course, we’ve been saying that since the day we got here, but finally the light went on, and according to our Deputy Premier—I haven’t heard the finance minister come up with that yet, but the Deputy Premier said we’re out of money.

That’s the only time in this Legislature that I’ve seen that we’ve actually got facts. So the brown envelope comes under the door, and it told us that a US realtor was being paid approximately $410 million to be bailed out. When people say, “Vic, what would your party do?”, well, you stop that kind of expenditure. That’s only one that we found. Can you imagine, Speaker, how many of these deals have been done that we do not know about?

Even though the Liberal government paid $10,000 to have files deleted, we still got to some level of the truth to understand that there’s a scandal here.

They’ve decided to have a fire sale of assets, which is included right here in Bill 144, schedule 22. They started a year ago when they borrowed the money to buy the General Motors shares. Last year, they sold the shares for $1.1 billion, and instead of doing the prudent thing—now, think, they borrowed $1 billion, they bought the shares, and then they sold the shares, and, instead of doing the prudent thing and putting the money back, lowering the debt by giving the money back to where they got it, instead, they plunked it into their operating costs. We now know that. It’s in their own budget, on page 45 of the 2015 budget. This year they are going to have the fire sale of our valuable asset of Hydro One, and now we know through the Financial Accountability Officer and through this document of theirs, page 3 of section 7, schedule 22, that that’s where the money’s going. It’s now going to pay down debt and deficit. They’ve put a line in here that is the line that tells us that it’s not intended to go into transit; it’s “to reimburse the crown” for the “construction or acquisition of infrastructure.” The money that was already in there is now coming out to pay the debt and deficit.", "I read you the line from the Ottawa Citizen. We really know that you cannot put it better than that. They nailed it down. They proved the point that, back in 2014, when they announced the $130 billion for infrastructure, they did not need the sale of Hydro One.", "The Financial Accountability Officer—let me read a quote or two from him. He said, “The province’s fiscal position deteriorates because of the loss of income generated by the sale.” So you know that this is going to hurt us in the long term. It’s going to hurt the financial picture. He also told us that this is really a financing decision: Do you borrow or do you sell? That’s what this is all about. It has nothing to do with what the government continues to say, that that is money going into transit. We now know that. It’s not about transit. It’s, do you borrow or do you sell an asset? I actually would go a little further and suggest it’s, do you just start managing your finances the way we do at our own homes? Again, we’ve seen the GM shares; I’ve told you that story. I told you the story about how we’re going to sell off—for what could be as little as $1.4 billion—hydro and lose $700 million a year. Again, we’re burning the furniture to heat the house.

When you run out of furniture, if you haven’t put in a mechanism to heat your house, you’re going to go cold, and that’s what has happened to the investors in Ontario: They are going cold in Ontario.", "This is the same group, that is selling Hydro One, that only a few months ago sold Ontario Northland, the 112-year-old company that’s in northern Ontario that runs transportation and communications throughout the north. This is the same government, that’s selling Hydro One, that sold Ontera. That is the telecommunications division. They sold it for $6 million. First of all, they spent, as we disclosed in this Legislature, $6.5 million on lawyers and consultants just to get $6 million for a sale. In any language, spending $6.5 million on a consultant to tell you to sell something for $6 million doesn’t seem practical to me.", "Again, it took an Auditor General—not the government; the government never told us. I’ve asked, in order paper questions, all of these questions and never get any answers. It took an Auditor General to tell us, “By the way, the asset was worth more than that.” So they sold it for $6 million and spent $6.5 million for consultants to tell you what to sell it for. The Auditor General told us they lost $61 million on that sale. Talk about giving away the farm. The government lost $61 million selling it. We’re going to let these guys handle multi-billion dollar assets when they can’t even transact something as small as that and, sadly, as precious as that to the people of Ontario, the people of northern Ontario.", "Now it’s gone. All the ongoing revenue from that asset is gone. They lost $60,937,000, Speaker. Can you imagine that? They knew they were losing that when they went into it. They knew that. They absolutely knew that when they went into the fire sale of Ontera, and yet they went ahead. There were seven times we talked about that in this Legislature, and I submitted order paper questions. Not once did the government stand up and say, “Look, we’re going to get $6 million for this, and I’m sorry but we’re going to lose $61 million.”", "It took an Auditor General; it always takes, as I said earlier, the OPP, the Auditor General, a brown envelope under the door, the Financial Accountability—it takes somebody else to give us the truth about what’s happening in Ontario.", "The Financial Accountability Officer also told us the initial 15% sale would significantly reduce the province’s deficit. Again, he told us that. This is proven out today on the fact that they are going to reimburse the crown for the construction or acquisition of infrastructure. The Financial Accountability Officer told us the same thing: This money is going to reduce the deficit. It has nothing to do with transit. It’s a shell game, and the Financial Accountability Officer laid it bare, Speaker. He told us that it was going to reduce the deficit, and he also told us that in the years following the sale of 60% of Hydro One, the province’s budget balance would be worse than it would have been without the sale.", "So let’s talk about what this bill doesn’t address, because there are lots of local issues that I have that I would like to speak about as well. Again, we heard loud and clear on W5 from the Deputy Premier that we’re out of money. We now know that the direct consequence of our seeing the Liberal government with such massive debt and deficits are the cuts that have happened in my riding. Some 350 front-line health care workers have been fired from North Bay regional hospital. Nobody denies that number. It’s 350. Two months ago alone, 158 people were fired from the hospital, bringing it to 350, which includes 100 nurses. These are 350 front-line health care workers and, over the last years, that 350 includes 100 nurses. Absolute and definitive, Speaker. They were out in front of my office, protesting the Liberal government. I cannot repeat in this Legislature what their chant was, but I’ll tell you, it was nothing kind about the Liberal government.", "Besides them—standing shoulder to shoulder with them—were members of the Nipissing University faculty. They are on strike today. Our university has been closed for three weeks. The students who expected to graduate in December—their year is now threatened. These young men and women who were leaving North Bay to go and start their careers are now scrambling to find a place to live, because they have given up their apartments at the end of December, and scrambling to get their job start date moved back. That is the reality of what is happening when you have a government that is out of control. The Liberal government fired 54 workers at the university, including 22 faculty.", "Speaker, this is part of the problem that is happening right across Ontario. You’ve got a government that just doesn’t know how to stop their scandals and their waste, and it all rolls downhill until it hits these students and their families. All their problems are like big boulders rolling downhill, and they just rammed these poor students and their parents.

You cannot slip those into a finance bill that was casually thrown at us last week without any notice, any understanding. So you know they are up to something. I guess that’s the bottom line. That’s the only way I can put it. They are looking to gain revenue on the backs of municipalities, on the backs of hydro ratepayers—revenue ostensibly through the Trillium Trust.

These all may be just fine. It allows the ministry or a public agency to request this information after it has begun working with a business or adviser.", "These are some housekeeping issues that they have tucked into a big bill, an omnibus bill.

I can tell you, Speaker, you can see why, when you have somebody who is going to be an expert to give you the big picture. That’s not what this government wants to hear about. This change in the act will remove the government’s legislated requirement to consult economic experts on large-scale financial issues. For example, the economic forecast council may have easily said the Hydro One deal will have negative macroeconomic effects, but the minister is choosing, again, to silence this organization rather than use its advice.", "They certainly didn’t like the Financial Accountability Officer’s.

That’s not the way this thing works.", "These agreements are supposed to have been in place a number of months ago and they’ve been dragging their feet and dragging their feet. Everything is coming in late, leaving an industry in limbo. I would suggest that when they say they are building up a horse racing industry, that’s false." ],

I truly appreciate how nuanced he was on it.", "This place is interesting, no doubt. This is a bizarre place. The member from Etobicoke Centre bemoaned the fact that the PC Party presented a platform plank in the last election that was to cut 100,000 jobs. They also touched, potentially, on the privatization of Hydro, not to the extent that the government was, but they presented a 50% sell-off of Ontario Hydro, not 60% like you’re doing. It is indeed interesting times when the Conservative Party—the PCs—are criticizing what, ostensibly, they would have done that you are now doing. You should actually be charged with plagiarism when it comes to the actions of your government.", "To the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore: Look, you campaigned against a Conservative candidate, but you are in fact doing the exact same thing. This is bizarre, Speaker. This is absolutely bizarre.", "I’m happy to hear that the PCs have come around and identified and understand that selling off a major asset is not the way to go. We should maintain, protect and bolster our public services. It may be a little too late to find that, but indeed, it isn’t too late to inform the government of how dire a mistake they are about to make." ],

I’ll again read from the binder, on page 3, from section 7 of schedule 22, some more of the wiggle words that are in here. Under section 6, actually: “The prescribed amount of designated proceeds of disposition.”", "I asked at the briefing, “What does that mean?” Here’s what the members of the Ministry of Finance said: “The government still retains discretion in how much the prescribed amount is.” Also, the word that I put in quotes is “flexibility.” What that means, again, Speaker, if you look down at number 7, is that, “Amounts not exceeding the balance in the Trillium Trust may be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.”", "So I asked a little bit more for an explanation of the proposed section 6, and what it means. They said, “It wouldn’t mean all the revenue of the sale goes into the Trillium Trust.” So when they say there are no games being played—these are all wiggle words, Speaker. They’re trying to sound like it’s definitive, but it’s not. It is all about making sure that they can sell these assets and bring their budget deficit down.", "Again, for the final time: This is to reimburse the crown for the construction or acquisition of infrastructure. It’s to reimburse.

It just dropped down on us last Wednesday. We had a very quick statement and a very quick briefing.", "I was reminiscing. It feels like that shift that happened when the first speech from the throne happened. I recall it feeling like a very different tone, a very different attitude, truly almost a sense of entitlement: “In this budget bill, you will deal with these measures. There will be very little debate on them.” Clearly this government is not interested even in debating or defending their own bill; they only spoke to it for 16 minutes.", "This is a trend that I hope the people of this province are paying attention to, because this is not the open and transparent government that we were promised. I actually went back—it really did feel very much like that throne speech, so I went back to it.", "I remember that there was a whole section called “Building from the activist centre.” Do you remember the “activist centre” language? It boasted to “open up government with increased transparency and more accountability,” and the people of this province were going to be involved in every decision. There was going to be a “full and active participant in your communities and in your lives”—this is the government saying that they were going to do this. This is where, of course, they promised to lead from the activist centre, which promised to “engage all Ontarians as full partners,” and there were some butterflies that flew off into the distance and blue skies.", "The promise, of course, was to ask for feedback before decisions were made.", "Finally—and this is probably the best piece—the government promised to put evidence before ideology and choose partnership over partisanship.", "I just raise this in the context of this budget bill because what we are seeing is almost completely the opposite of what we were promised and, I would suggest to you, what the people of this province thought they would be getting.", "All of us, of course, have seen the fallout of Hydro One. Every single member in this House—I am certain of it—hears from constituents across this province. They are completely and utterly dismayed by the sell-off and privatization of Hydro One. They know very clearly that they did not hear this promise in the election.", "I think it needs to be stated very clearly that this government is ignoring the power imbalance that Ontarians are feeling. Some 80% of Ontarians have said that they are not in support of this—188 municipalities. And yet, this government very clearly has blinders on and has presented a false choice to the people of this province: that if the sell-off of Hydro One does not happen, then you will not get infrastructure.", "I’m going to be referencing the Financial Accountability Officer’s report later.", "All of this has to really do with schedule 22 of this bill. This is the little carrot that this government has led through to the people in saying—this is the false choice: “If we sell off Hydro One, you get infrastructure. If we don’t sell Hydro One, no more infrastructure for the province of Ontario.” It really is quite incredible to me.", "Just to complete the thought on the speech from the throne from 2014: As it was being delivered—this is my recollection of it, just to be fair—it had a bit of a Shakespearean, theatrical feel to it at the time. Who knew that right in the middle of the activist centre, where everything was going to be fair, everything was going to be open, everything would be transparent, there would be a banker? It’s not just any banker. He’s just off that Premier’s office—in my mind’s eye, there’s an emerald green curtain and there are some levers. Who would have thought that this Premier would have a banker using the Premier’s office as the pulpit for privatization? Honestly, you couldn’t even write this stuff. And what do we have as a result? We have one of the biggest and most harmful privatization plays in the history of this province.", "What schedule 2 very clearly outlines is that the benefit to the people of this province—even if there was a kernel of benefit to this privatization play by this Premier, the people are not necessarily going to see any benefit from it.", "I’ll touch on the lack of consultation—because this is the pattern, this is the growing frustration, and this does not benefit any civic engagement in politics at all.", "The concept of broadening ownership: What could be further from the truth, Mr. Speaker? Until the first 15% tranche was sold, up to that point, every Ontarian owned Hydro One. So you can’t broaden it to more than the entire province. But what you can do is carve away little pieces of it for Bay Street. This concept of broadening ownership needs to be challenged, day in and day out, by everyone on this side of the House.", "As the finance minister and the Premier carve off this very important revenue-generating public asset, we are dealing with the fallout in our own ridings. As it relates to this Budget Measures Act, we see very clearly that the people of this province are completely caught off guard by the sale of Hydro One and they do not believe that any funding—any profit, if you will—is going to flow through the consolidated revenues and then do a little bait and switch and end up in the Trillium Trust. The people of this province have serious trust issues with this concept because they see it as a shell game.", "I remember just last spring, we had a town hall in Waterloo. A fellow got up to the microphone and he was shaking; he was shaking with anger. He was enraged because he knew that he got duped. He confessed that he had actually worked on the local Liberal candidate campaign. He challenged me and he said, “Where was this in the campaign literature?” I said, “It wasn’t. It wasn’t there. I never read it. You didn’t see it because it wasn’t there.” But I do think—and I will maintain to this day—that if it had been there, if this government had clearly campaigned on carving off Hydro One for privatization purposes, we would have had a very different election result.", "We are not buying what this government is selling, and I’m happy to report that, actually, most Ontarians are not as well. This leads me to delve into schedule 22.", "Before we actually go into the way the funding would flow through privatization, through the private shares from the sell-off of Hydro One, we really need to take a step back and look at, how did we even get here? I think it’s really important that people understand how serious these trust issues are. The members on the other side of the House will remember that before the election, Mr. Sousa and the Premier insisted that the government did not wish to privatize Hydro One or OPG, and that the advisory council had been told to “give preference to owning rather than selling core” interests. This is a matter of public record. I want to get it on the record here.", "In April 2014, there was a speech to the Economic Club of Canada by Mr. Sousa, who said, “‘Continuing public ownership, however, remains a key priority’....", "“There are ways to improve efficiency and optimize financial performance of any company, including OPG, Hydro One and the LCBO.... ‘We will not do what the previous PC government did ... with the fire sale of Highway 407.’”", "These words come back to haunt you. On October 20, we asked the Premier why she thought public hydro belonged in the hands of private speculators. We put that question to the Premier. The Premier denied any plan to sell public hydro: Ed Clark “has said quite clearly that he doesn’t believe that selling those assets is the right answer. He has said that.", "“I believe that the leader of the third party is probably having a bit of a hard time framing the question because in fact Ed Clark has said he agrees that selling those assets is not the right thing to do.”", "I’m glad that this is a matter of public record. I would have been happier to have had the government have the fortitude to stay and stand by these words. Unsatisfied, of course, our leader demanded the government seek the approval of the public before proceeding with the sale of public hydro, and then the Premier responded, saying in turn, “I’m laughing because the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change is replaying the attacks that were coming at us from the third party before the election....", "“We have said we believe that these assets need to be in the hands of the people of Ontario. Ed Clark has agreed with that.”", "Do you remember this? It’s a matter of Hansard, so I’m just quoting it.", "Then we go back again—because we have been trying to nail down this very slippery government on where privatization is going to happen and when it is not going to happen, and with, of course, the further promise of selling off more public assets. Once again, we cannot get an answer. We cannot pull an answer out of anyone from that side of the House. But that’s when the Premier then said, “It must actually be very hard for the leader of the third party to ask these questions. She knows that we’re not selling off the assets. She knows perfectly well that that was one of the parameters as Ed Clark went into this review. She knows that we are keeping these assets in public hands....” Well, I guess something desperate happened in that little curtained room off the Premier’s office that says—something must have happened, because these are their words. These are the Premier’s words and her promise to the people of this province.", "Once again, of course, on October 27—this is actually just over a year ago—Mr. Sousa replied, “We have made it clear that we are not going to sell off our assets.” On November 3, once again, the Premier said, “Let’s just be clear: Despite what the NDP are saying, we asked the council to retain the government’s long-term ownership of these assets. In fact, what Ed Clark said on, October 17: ‘We recommend keeping all three companies—OPG, Hydro One and the LCBO.’ So, in fact, there is not a sell-off of these companies,” as we would have them believe.", "This is a huge shift from where the Premier was, where Mr. Clark was, just a year ago. We have the proof in the Hansard, in this House, which demonstrates a very serious retraction of that position.", "As we move forward with schedule 22—I think the critic for the PC Party actually shares some of the concerns that we have. There is definitely some crossover because we both received briefings from great ministry staff. Mine was this morning at 8:30, and I really want to commend the staff who work in those respective ministries and departments. They have their little bits and pieces that they really know very well. I just wanted to put that on the record. They were very helpful.", "But just so that people understand fully that schedule 22 of Bill 144, the existing Trillium Trust is completely repealed with Bill 144 except for a few definitions in s. 1. Instead of recording—and this is the key part—all receipts and disbursements of public money to and from the trust, the accounts shall now track:", "“1. Prescribed amounts of designated proceeds of disposition of qualifying assets.", "“2. Prescribed amounts of prescribed non-cash benefits that are recognized by the crown in connection with dispositions of qualifying assets.", "“3. All expenditures of public money under this act.”", "So in other words, the Trillium Trust is no longer a bank account. The way that the government talks about the Trillium Trust is that it’s this bucket of money. As you sell off Hydro One or bits and pieces of buildings that were once owned by the state, by the government, all that money goes right over into this little trust fund, and someday, in a far, faraway land, Kitchener–Waterloo will get a GO train that actually goes two ways.", "That actually is not the case. The Trillium Trust is no longer a bank account recording the flow of money in and out of the trust. No money is actually ever deposited into or withdrawn from the Trillium Trust. It is now an accounting procedure for recording the designation of proceeds and non-cash benefits under the act, as well as for labelling certain infrastructure spending from the consolidated revenue as authorized expenditures under the act.", "I’m pretty sure that if this government had done some consultation on at least this component, we would have seen some genuine concern and interest from stakeholders who want to see infrastructure actually come to be realized, the infrastructure plan of this government to be realized. We’re not quite sure what that plan is altogether because there are so many strings pulling these projects along, depending on the day of the week, that it is hard to find what the real priority is—which is why I stand in this House, as does the other member, from Kitchener–Conestoga, and we ask questions. The only way that we can see this government following through on priorities, or so-called priorities, is if we keep it on the front burner.", "This morning, when I asked the question about the one-way GO trains that go in the morning and then the other one-way GO trains that come from Toronto to Kitchener in the afternoon, which I know you sometimes have to take as well—those are not pleasant experiences, nor is this a transit option, quite honestly, that meets the needs of commuters. The CEO from Thalmic Labs, I think, last week said it’s absolutely ludicrous, in the economy of Ontario right now, to expect people to be on a train for over four hours, because productivity is impacted and productivity is also connected to connectivity. A two-hour slow train and the promise of two more slow trains in the morning and two more slow trains in the afternoon on the way back isn’t really a 2015-16 option.", "The longer this gets dragged on—people lose hope and they just get in their car. Like myself, they get in the car at 3:30 this morning, which I can tell you is not the best idea. I just want to put that on the record.", "Back to the Trillium Trust: In addition to the existing assets that have been designated by regulation, the following assets will be designated under the Trillium Trust: the province’s shares in Hydro One and Hydro One Brampton; the head office lands of the LCBO; the Ontario Power Generation head office building; and the OPG Lakeview lands. As with the existing Trillium Trust Act, the designated proceeds of disposition is equal to the gross proceeds minus the book value of the assets.", "As far as I can tell, the idea is that when money is withdrawn from the consolidated revenue fund for infrastructure expenditures, the government may record, as an authorized expenditure, an amount up to the total balance in the trust.", "The government is given broad regulatory authority to prescribe “anything that is permitted or required by this act to be prescribed, designated or done by regulation or in accordance with the regulations.”", "The minister has a huge amount of power. It will never come to us. It will all be done by regulation, which, you must admit, Mr. Speaker, is of course the growing trend. This government would bring barely anything to this House if they could just get it done through regulation, which is ironic, because when they can actually do something by regulation which would be beneficial to constituents, they can’t find the time of day to do it. So it does go back to this idea of priorities.", "As I said, the government is given broad regulatory authority to prescribe “anything that is permitted or required by this act to be prescribed, designated or done by regulation or in accordance with the regulations.” As with the existing act, there is still no guarantee that money from an asset sale would be dedicated to the trust. The finance critic for the PC Party also mentioned this.", "Actually, I want to be really open and transparent: This came up in the briefing this morning. The government’s lawyer said, “No, no, it will, because it says ‘may.’ It says ‘may.’”", "“May,” in their opinion, is permissive. Its language is permissive. We wanted to know: Why wouldn’t it say “shall”? If the true intention of these funds is to be invested in infrastructure and dedicated solely to infrastructure and transit investment, then why not make it completely clear?", "I had this quote. Of course, I went right back to my office and did some research, but I don’t think I printed it off. It goes through the whole definition of “may” and “shall” and legalese. At the very heart of the matter, though, of course, is the trust issue, right? That remains the key issue.", "As I said, there is still no guarantee that the amounts credited to the trust represent actual money. I think our energy critic has done an excellent job in addressing the non-cash revenue items. It is also now possible to increase the balance of the Trillium Trust simply by designating a gain on paper with respect to assets that the government already owns.", "We will be addressing schedule 22 going forward. Hopefully, it gets to the finance committee very quickly and we get a chance to bring some of those concerns to the fore.", "I think I was focused mostly on schedule 22 this weekend, when I was reviewing and studying the bill. My daughter was doing word problems. You remember the joy of word problems, or the joy of grade 9 math? My husband was working with her, because I don’t have the patience for word problems.", "I was thinking about why we’re here. Aside from going through the entire history and the backtracking on what this government has said and who they’ve said it to, I was beginning to think about—the focus on transit right now is a little ironic. You’ll remember, Mr. Speaker, because you were here, that in 2010, when the Big Move was supposed to be moving, the Premier, who was then the Minister of Transportation, removed $4 billion from that Big Move. That was supposed to be dedicated to build transit.", "Of course, the Premier now lays claim to this activist centre, but it turns out that the activist at the centre now is a banker. So, this is a whole new world that we’re dealing with. This is not the progressive model—the open and transparent model—we heard about at length during the election.", "Certainly, we did fight for the Financial Accountability Officer to be a part of this Legislature. We fought at the time, and we still think this government needs an independent officer to look at financial decisions before they happen, which is why I think it was so very valuable to see that the Financial Accountability Officer, of his own initiative, looked at the Hydro One sale—the privatization—and came back and sat us all down and said, “Listen, these are our concerns,” and I’m going to go through those concerns in a second.", "After dealing with schedule 22 and raising some of our concerns, I think I want to spend a little time on schedule 12, the EllisDon bill.

This has to do with the Electricity Act, 1998. It has to do with residual stranded debt and stranded debt—all references to residual stranded debt and stranded debt are erased from the act. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just take an eraser? There are several sections that are repealed, and the Minister of Finance is no longer required to determine or report the value of the residual stranded debt or stranded debt or announce when the residual stranded debt has been retired. Why would you actually put that in a bill? If you’re the finance minister, this doesn’t speak to accountability or transparency.", "There is a really important thing, though, that stems out of this, coming from some pretty interesting criticism of this government. I don’t know if you know Tom Adams Energy. He does a bit of a blog, and he reported back on Bill 144 and rightly addresses some of the concerns around the OEFC. Really, the government has been silent on explaining the impact of the sale of Hydro One on the OEFC, the Ontario Electricity Financial Corp., until now. He goes into two themes, but what I really want to get on the record, because I completely agree with him, is that he goes on to say—I quote this from November 20, just last week:", "“Bill 144, an omnibus budget measures act introduced November 18th, contains the first clues so far disclosed as to how the government intends to fill the hole it has created at OEFC with the sale of Hydro One.”", "Actually not a lot of people have been talking about this.", "“One section of Bill 144 repeals section 92(4) of the Electricity Act. That section of the Electricity Act would have redirected the flow of municipal taxes back to municipalities (and away from OEFC) once a portion of OEFC’s liabilities called the Residual Stranded Debt were paid off. What all of this means is that Wynne’s signature initiative to use the proceeds of the sale of Hydro One to build transit is to be achieved in part through the farcical finance of seizing revenue from another level of government. The amount of money is small in the scheme of things but it illustrates the government’s reliance on astrology and unicorn sightings to guide their electricity and transit plans.”", "I couldn’t really get up and say this, but I just did because I’m quoting it directly from Tom Adams. He goes on to say:", "“The financial flows underpinning Ontario’s electricity system, particularly OEFC, were designed from back in the days of Mike Harris as a shell game. The Libs,” I’m sorry, the Liberals, “have taken the shell game to ever greater levels of subterfuge. The government uses this shell game to sustain the provincial Auditor General’s continued confusion about the reality of the situation.”", "He goes on because he thinks the Auditor General should be calling out the government on all of this, which is really hard to do because even when the Financial Accountability Officer does so, even when he releases a report—and the report is under all of those papers over there—the government: It’s like they’re reading a different document.", "The Financial Accountability Officer has said very clearly that the revenue that they expect to get from the sell-off of Hydro One needs to be challenged. If you’ve been listening to what I said about schedule 22 and the Trillium Trust, and going way, way back—it feels like a long time to the throne speech and putting evidence over partisanship and research over ideology—you remember those days? If you forget for just a second that at the activist centre we have a banker, then you can look at the financial accountabilities report, because whatever money this government has said—this goes back to the false choice point: that they will somehow garner $9 billion from selling Hydro One, which, up until two weeks ago, we all owned, and they’re going to broaden ownership to Bay Street but not the rest of us in this province. And there’s a long-term cost for this policy decision.", "The FAO did his job and he came out and he said that instead of the promised $4 billion for infrastructure, the financial accountability report shows that the sale will yield only $1.4 billion to $3.1 billion in actual spendable cash. As I pointed out last week at our opposition day motion, in 2013-14 this government failed to spend $1.2 billion that they had budgeted. It was right there in the budget for transit, and they failed to spend it. Then in the 2013-14 budget they failed to spend almost $400 million.", "This is a government that—even when they come forward with an infrastructure plan, even when they have a budget line in the budget and the budget passes, they fail to spend that money wisely. They fail to invest it wisely. This, once again, goes back to the premise that this is completely a false choice: that if we don’t sell Hydro One, you get no infrastructure. It’s nonsensical. It makes no sense whatsoever.", "When you follow the money, which you’ll understand is not the easiest thing to do at this place, and the Financial Accountability Officer challenges the projected profits from the sale of Hydro One, we need to remind people in this province that the $1.4 billion to $3.4 billion in actual cash, which would potentially go through consolidated revenues and potentially be moved into a piece of transit infrastructure investment, is roughly 1% of the government’s total $130-billion 10-year infrastructure promise, or $140 million per year, equal to just 0.1%—one 10th of one per cent—of the province’s budget.", "That’s why we have been challenging this concept—back to that throne speech—that this is going to be an inclusive government that is open and transparent and puts people first. The only people they are putting first with the sell-off Hydro One is that 1%. The 1% is going to do very fine. You can say it: Bay Street got to the Hydro One trough as fast as they could two weeks ago. It sold like hotcakes because they know that they’re going to make their money.", "Conservation, which should be first and foremost—some of our policy directions around Hydro One—is going to fall right by the wayside because when it’s the shareholders who are driving a company, the shareholder’s interests trump a policy like conservation, because they’re not going to make as much money because we’re not going to be using as much energy.", "Back to the FAO report: As a result of the various complicated accounting procedures, there will be non-cash proceeds in the form of equity revaluations that will bring the total credit to the Trillium Trust up to $3.3 billion. These paper assets will have to be converted into cash in order to pay bills, perhaps by borrowing against paper assets.", "This is, without a doubt, a bit of a shell game, and it makes it harder for us to track the money, especially the dedicated funds for infrastructure and transit, which this government says the sale of Hydro One is all about. That’s what they claim.", "Schedule 6 of Bill 144 looks to amend and dissolve the Ontario Economic Forecast Council. You’ll see that every budget—I have one here—is rubber-stamped by the Ontario Economic Forecast Council, but there are currently no appointees to the council. They have allowed this to wither and die on the vine, and I think it’s probably because the council just threw up their hands and gave up. Anyway, that’s my interpretation of it.", "But fortunately, while it is discouraging that this council has been dissolved—and the Ministry of Finance now “anticipates continuing to consult with independent experts relating to macroeconomic forecasts and assumptions to be used in the preparation of the budget and fiscal plan”—they need only go right to the Financial Accountability Officer. His mandate is very clear. Yet when he came out with the report around Hydro One and the revenue projections from the sale of Hydro One, this government was not receptive to that research and to that economic modelling. In fact, they weren’t so co-operative either. They didn’t want to share the information, which leads us to this whole other gray area of commercial sensitivity or cabinet confidentiality around commercial ventures.", "Hydro One, up to that point, was a public asset. It’s interesting that the government was so reluctant to make the case. So the Financial Accountability Officer comes to the table and says, “It’s my job to look into these issues. Can you please share this information with me?” and they say, “No.” Now, if the business case was there, then I think they would be very forthcoming and very proud of it. Right?", "So just to go back, the FAO was clear that the economic benefit of infrastructure investments was not going to be as the government projected. Now the government is going to come back, and they’re going to say, “Well, he didn’t take into account the economic benefit—period—of all infrastructure benefits.” I want to get this on the record. The FAO made it very clear that the economic benefit of infrastructure investments was irrelevant to his conclusion. His analysis assumed that the infrastructure would be built in any case. His analysis compared what would happen if the government financed by borrowing or by sale proceeds. This, actually, came up in our briefing as well. The FAO was very clear: Either way the infrastructure will be built. You’re either going to borrow for it, or you’re going to sell off a component of Hydro One for $1.4 billion, which is about the amount of money you didn’t spend on infrastructure in the last two budgets because you couldn’t get your act together, or you were too focused on the politics of infrastructure.", "Just to move forward, the FAO estimated that the province will lose net revenues of $444 million to $487 million a year by 2025. Now, I know the government isn’t that focused on 2025. I know that they are very focused on 2017-18, but what a cost it’s going to be. We already know that in the 2014 budget there was a 6% reduction in program spending in every ministry except for five. Some of those ministries, like health care for instance, were frozen, but that is a cut. In the last year’s budget there was a 5.5% reduction in program spending in every ministry except for a few, like justice. Yet, those other ministries that are so-called safe—there’s no safe area in the province of Ontario.", "But the government is not doing some of the work that they should be doing, which is something that they could have included in this particular piece of legislation, to address taxable compliance, for instance.

There is no good reason why any government anywhere in Canada should be borrowing money at an almost 28% interest rate to fund infrastructure. This government could easily—I mean, they can’t leave the country; some of them, I think, sometimes would like to. But they could get an interest rate of 2.8% to 3% for those infrastructure projects.", "Just to give full attention and weight to the FAO’s report as it relates, because I think the FAO is going to have—I hope his mandate will have some impact on the next budget that comes to the fore. Instead of shrinking the province’s net debt by $5 billion, the FAO said, the debt could actually increase by nearly $300 million by 2025 as a result of the Hydro One sale, and perhaps as much as $2.7 billion, if the government eliminated the debt retirement charge on non-residential electricity bills.", "He says, “In years following the sale of 60 per cent of Hydro One, the province’s budget balance would be worse than it would have been without the sale.” This is on the first page of the FAO report, and it certainly should warrant some attention by this government, for sure.", "Now I think I should move on to schedule 12.", "Section 12: This is like Groundhog Day, Mr. Speaker, this EllisDon bill, sneaking it into an omnibus bill—" ],

Those are public services, those are public jobs that are getting cut by this government.” We concur with Don Drummond: At the end of this term, by 2017-18, this government will be able to boast that they have the lowest program public service spending in the country.

Actually, Hydro One CEO Anthony Haines is totally complimenting this government on this sort of “sell here, reinvest there; put it under this shell, slide it under this shell; a little bit through consolidated revenues, not really in the Trillium Trust, but leave it up to regulation; and then the finance minister gets to call it whatever he wants.” That’s essentially what this budget act actually does.", "But of course, this sort of criticism comes from Mr. Haines, who has been a leading proponent for several of the government’s most mismanaged, wasteful energy initiatives, including smart meters, conservation programs and energy storage, so keeping good company right there.", "When we brought our opposition day motions to this floor last week, I made it really clear that we were doing so on behalf of the people of this province. The people of this province deserve to have a say. They didn’t get an opportunity to do so during the election, because they didn’t know that this government was going to sell off Hydro One. As I pointed out, and as the Financial Accountability Officer has pointed out, Hydro One is not a deal that is going to benefit the people of this province. In fact, there are some long-term negative impacts on revenues that come into this province the more this province goes down this road. In the long run, there will actually be an increased deficit—the Financial Accountability Officer has done the economic modelling—every year except after 2017-18, when there will be a miracle and some balance will happen.", "I’m waiting to hear the fall economic statement later this week, because as I pointed out already, as did the FAO, this government has greatly exaggerated the revenues they are supposed to be bringing in because they didn’t use appropriate nominal GDP levels. So we see future cuts coming; in fact, even stronger cuts than we saw in the 2014 budget and the 2015 budget. This government seems complacent, or amenable, to the idea of cutting programs that actually affect the most vulnerable people in this province.", "Just this weekend, I was at a Home of Their Own conference; I was speaking there. Just as a small example of this, back in 2006 the government went to these families who have severely disabled children and said, “You know what? We’re going to get out of the group home business. We would really like you to work together, and we’ll support you in that.” That was in 2006. So three parents I have been working with in Kitchener-Waterloo for three years are on the hook right now. They bought a house and provided some services, but they’re not receiving any support from the government, except for two days a month. They bought the house and do the maintenance, and the government is not willing to come to—this family didn’t even qualify for some pilot money, even though the government told them to go out and buy this house and work collaboratively together. You know, one day they’re not going to be able to take care of their severely disabled children. One day the state is going to have to take care of them instead. Why not be proactive? That should be a priority that this government is focused on.", "That’s sort of like this walking contradiction we are seeing here in this Legislature. With great urgency and at the last minute, we get a budget bill that reintroduces the EllisDon bill, compromises collective bargaining in the province of Ontario and provides no clarity, really, around the Trillium Trust and this false choice of selling Hydro One: If you sell Hydro One, you get infrastructure; if you don’t sell Hydro One, you get no infrastructure. This makes no sense, especially when you follow the money.", "With that, as always, I think we are going to be caucusing this bill, but there are clearly pieces in this legislation that were meant to put us in a corner, which doesn’t speak to that original intent from that activist centre, where there is a banker now, of working collaboratively with the other parties and trying to strengthen this province, to build this province up by not tearing it down and not hurting the most vulnerable people in the province.", "With that, I will leave it there.

I think it was alluded to that the Deputy Premier actually has committed and commented on W5 that the Liberal government is out of money, so this truly is a fire sale. It really concerns me. That is money that should be paying down the debt so there’s more money to actually spend on our programs for our less fortunate, our needy, our health care, our Community Living groups, those types of groups, as opposed to putting money into a budget that will make the Liberal books look better for a very short term.", "The Financial Accountability Officer has come out already and said that this sale is going to be a couple of years of short-term gain but there’s going to be long-term pain.

In probably four or five years, you’d have it all back. But, no, we’re going to give it up for the next 50 or 100 years.

For us in western Mississauga, one of those changes means that at Sobeys in Churchill Meadows, at Metro in Meadowvale and Lisgar and at Longo’s in Meadowvale, we’ll now be able to buy beer in the stores if they so apply, just as they can now sell Ontario VQA wine in their stores.", "Now, earlier this year, a report to the province asked why stores could sell wine but not beer. Many of us have visited other states and provinces, other countries, other jurisdictions, where society, as we knew it, had not collapsed with the broadening of the distribution of wine and beer in retail outlets.", "The bill also puts in place measures that will affect our electricity bills, and I’d like to talk about that in a little bit of detail. Back in 1999, the former Conservative government in Ontario dismantled the old Ontario Hydro to look at selling the corporation. In doing so, they set up Hydro One to own the towers, the wires, the substations and some of Ontario’s local distribution. Hydro One now does about 24% of the local distribution in the province of Ontario.", "That outgoing PC government also established Ontario Power Generation, which owned the dams and the Darlington and Pickering nuclear stations, and other generation facilities. As well, regulation exists under the Ontario Energy Board, and planning and system management have since been consolidated under the Independent Electric System Operator.", "That former Ontario PC government took some $19.8 billion of Ontario Hydro debt and added an additional $1 billion of debt it incurred buying spot power on the US market for as much as $2.83 per kilowatt hour and then reselling it for 4.3 cents per kilowatt hour in Ontario in the days when the outgoing PC government was also hauling emergency diesel generators into Ontario cities in the event that the electrical system collapsed altogether. By the way, the electrical system did collapse altogether in August 2003.", "For the past decade, Ontarians have rebuilt our province’s transmission network and power generation plants at the same time as Ontario got out of coal-fired power generation. By comparison, our US neighbours have continued to run their wires, their nuclear reactors, their power dams and their coal plants into the ground.", "Ontario has already taken a lot of the pain. The six dozen or so largest US utilities have not. They have yet to step up and look at a future rushing toward US residences and businesses, just like an express freight. In essence, Ontario has bought tomorrow’s power system at yesterday’s prices, financing it all at near-zero interest rates. Across the border, Americans will need to open their wallets to buy today’s power system at tomorrow’s prices, financing it all at interest rates that have nowhere to go but up.", "Ontario’s power rates are already lower than or competitive with rates in the fast-growing jurisdictions, such as the US eastern seaboard, the Great Lakes basin, the southwest or California. In those jurisdictions, just as here, the local utilities are turning off coal and moving toward a blend of natural gas, wind and solar, just like we did here, all the while looking at upgrading their wires and refurbishing their dams and their nuclear reactors—10 years behind Ontario.", "Now, after the end of this year, 2015, Ontarians can look forward to seeing the debt retirement charge cut off of their bill. What this means is that when you look at your bill and you see that one little line that says, “Debt retirement charge,” after the end of this year—gone. At the same time, the Ontario Clean Energy Benefit, which took 10% off of your electricity bill, is going to be replaced with an income-tested means called the Ontario Electricity Support Program. It will benefit those who need assistance the most by flowing the funds through the Ontario Trillium Benefit along with your sales tax credit, your seniors’ property tax credit and, in the north, your Ontario Northern Energy Tax Credit.", "This bill will, if passed, mean that commercial, industrial and non-residential electricity users would stop paying the debt retirement charge nine months earlier than previously estimated and also give them time to make proper investment decisions. This would save a typical large industrial company about 7% on their energy bills; it would save a northern industrial company more than 8% and a small business about 4% on their electricity bills.", "Speaker, this is a measure that, all by itself, brings with it a significant benefit to the province. While this is a bill with an awful lot of other little tweaks and measures, these energy benefits, all by themselves, are going to make a major difference here, and that’s one solid reason that for those of us in western Mississauga, in our neighbourhoods of Lisgar, Meadowvale and Streetsville, this is a bill that we need and we should have passed and enacted in between now and when the House rises for Christmas." ],

As he mentioned, he and I are both sharing our time with the wonderful member from Burlington who will be speaking in just a moment.", "I’m delighted to have the opportunity to speak today, here in my place, with respect to Bill 144. I say that not just as the Minister of Transportation, but, of course, also as someone who represents the community of Vaughan here in the Legislature, which, like many of the other communities from the greater Toronto and Hamilton area and beyond, is a fast-growing part of this province that has a wide variety of very pressing infrastructure needs.", "This bill does speak to the importance of making sure that we continue to get it right with respect to investing, over not just the next year or decade, but, frankly, even beyond that point in time, the billions of dollars that are required for communities here in the greater Toronto and Hamilton area, like Vaughan, like Burlington, like Mississauga and others, and then, of course, Speaker, beyond the GTHA. We’re also talking about communities from the north to the southwest to the east: I think of Kitchener-Waterloo; I think, of course, of Ottawa; I think of Thunder Bay; I think of Sarnia—every community in this province, 444 municipalities. I don’t believe anybody here would disagree that in each of those communities, there is a significant and pressing need for infrastructure investments that range all the way from enhancing and building new public transit to extending and expanding roads and highways and improving bridges.", "A very, very key and fundamental part not only of our government’s agenda but of this specific legislation deals with the mechanisms that will help support the increased and expanded investments that are required, the additional resources that have to be deployed to make sure that we continue to see our quality of life across the province improved, but also to make sure that our economy continues to be prosperous.", "Now, over the last number of days, we on this side of the Legislature—and unfortunately for those people watching at home, the opposition from both the Conservative and NDP caucuses—have had the chance to speak on issues relating to not only this bill, but our government’s ambitious determination to move forward with investing in infrastructure. We’ve heard all kinds of wild and crazy accusations flowing from members on that side of the Legislature. It’s unfortunate, because in each of their cases, for the most part, as I look at them on a day-after-day basis, I know the extent to which their communities, the communities they have been charged with representing here in this chamber, need additional support for infrastructure.", "Of course, as opposition parties are often willing to do, they want to pick apart certain details. They want to go after the finer minutiae in our plan. But what they neglect to tell people in this chamber, what they certainly neglect to tell media and what they neglect to tell people in their own communities is exactly how they would come forward and make the infrastructure investments that are required to improve our collective quality of life and to strengthen our province’s economy.", "It’s unfortunate because for too long, I think, members of both the Conservative caucus and the NDP caucus have been far too focused on that level of granular detail, as opposed to saying, “Look, we tend to disagree, as we are required to do from time to time as opposition, but here is our alternative plan,” and it’s a plan that actually can be backed up with facts. It’s a plan that can give people in communities as diverse as Kitchener–Waterloo and Hamilton, folks from Sudbury, folks from London—right across this province—some hope, some sense that the Conservatives and the NDP have a plan to build the province up.", "Yet day after day, hour after hour, in debate after debate, opposition motions, questions asked in question period, and debate here on Bill 144, what the opposition does time and time again is make it clear that they have no plan, or at least that they have no plan for which the numbers add up.", "It’s all fine and dandy for members like the NDP finance critic, the member from Kitchener, to stand in their place and talk about whether or not we’ve delivered on a promise that had a 10-year horizon, about whether or not, in the first 14, 15 or 16 months of our mandate, we delivered on a promise that we always said would take a certain period of time.", "She also stands in her place, among many others on that side of the House—in fact, like many others on both sides of the House—and says, “Show us proof. Show us proof, beyond commitments and media releases, that you’re serious about this plan.”", "Speaker, I don’t know how much clearer we could be with respect to our plan and demonstrating tangible results of our plan. I’ve said this before, in my place, in this House: Right across the province of Ontario, highways continue to be expanded and extended. Bridges and interchanges continue to be enhanced and reinvigorated.", "Here in the greater Toronto and Hamilton area, it’s impossible to miss. If you spend any time in the GTHA, or here in the city of Toronto, it’s impossible to miss the Eglinton Crosstown LRT: 19 kilometres; 25 stops; three connections to GO stations, or at least to GO transit; multiple connections to the subway here in Toronto. It’s a $9.1-billion project that’s currently being constructed, the single largest public transit project in Ontario history. Yet the members of both the NDP and the Conservative parties say, “Show us proof that it’s real. Show us proof that you’re actually building.”", "This list goes on. Right now, we are currently double-tracking, for example, the Barrie corridor of GO south of Rutherford station, from York University to Rutherford—another example of something that’s physically required in order for us to deliver on two-way, all-day GO service.", "So I don’t know. I mean, it’s really unclear to me. It’s interesting, because the NDP talks about having a referendum on certain issues. In the last election campaign—which didn’t take place four years ago or 10 years ago; it took place about 18 or 19 months ago—the people of Ontario had a chance to hold up to the light all three parties’ plans for building the province up—all three of them. They had a chance to look at the Conservative plan. They had a chance to look at the NDP plan, such that it was. They had a chance to look at that plan. Of course, they had a chance to consider the plan that Kathleen Wynne and the Ontario Liberals put forward, with specific details included for transit—" ],

I don’t know, Speaker.", "At the same time, the leader of the NDP stands in her place—I know I sound like a broken record, and I apologize for that to those members. But day after day, the leader of the NDP, Andrea Horwath, stands up and says, “You shouldn’t be doing this.” What she doesn’t tell the people in her own caucus and in her own party, the rank and file of the NDP in communities all across the province of Ontario—she doesn’t come forward and say, “Here’s the project in your community that I wouldn’t fund. Here’s the project that I wouldn’t build. Here’s the project that I’d cancel.”", "I would expect that, as leader of her party, someone who aspires, I can only imagine, to one day be the Premier of Ontario, to one day have that opportunity—I believe there’s a responsibility that flows to the leader of the NDP and to the members of her caucus from Kitchener, from London, from Hamilton, from all over the province, to level with the people here in this chamber: “We don’t want to build infrastructure the way the Liberals are doing it. Therefore, we don’t plan to build it. Here’s what we’re going to cancel.” They won’t say it; they should. It’s unfortunate.", "We’re going to continue to build this province up.

It’s an absolute pleasure to stand in my place today on behalf of the community of Burlington and join my colleague from Mississauga–Streetsville and, of course, the always eloquent Minister of Transportation.", "It’s indeed my honour to speak to Bill 144, the Budget Measures Act. Our government is committed to building Ontario up. This is a commitment that we have repeatedly made to the people of Ontario by our words and by our actions in communities across our province and right here in this chamber.", "Bill 144 implements necessary changes in order to continue our government’s economic plan, including investing in the individuals in our communities, helping them to develop their skills, and making the largest investments in public infrastructure in Ontario, of which the Minister of Transportation spoke so eloquently a moment ago: over $130 billion over the next decade, something that is greatly needed across our province, something that leading economists and business organizations have told us is critically important. Indeed, I’ve often heard the Minister of Transportation say—he said it when he came to my riding—that we are simultaneously playing catch-up and keep-up. I know that the people in Burlington appreciate these investments in transit infrastructure in particular. The day after our last budget, in fact, our mayor came to a breakfast and extolled the virtues of these investments. Our businesses have done so locally, and our citizens talk to me about it all the time. They’re enormously grateful. Finally, we’re strengthening retirement security so that Ontario’s young people can live through their golden years with some financial stability because no one wants a generation of Ontarians retiring in poverty.", "The proposed amendments to the Trillium Trust Act will ensure that net revenue gains from the sale of assets, like the broadened ownership of Hydro One, will be invested in priority infrastructure projects. These record investment levels have supported improved GO transit service. Major projects are under way—the regional express rail, the Lakeshore West and East corridors, and all-day, two-way 15-minute GO service between my community on the one end and Oshawa on the other; just extraordinary. Enhanced regional mobility will also include the Dundas rapid transit project linking Toronto, Mississauga, Oakville and my community of Burlington. Ongoing planning and design work will continue for this project, which is a big part of the next wave of Metrolinx’s Big Move plan.", "Of course, all citizens have a right to live in walk- and bicycle-friendly communities.

I know that the people of Ontario understand this. They know that we need to do something for the future, that we need to do something for our young workforce of today to, again, ensure that they can retire not in poverty but in dignity. In fact, when the minister came to Burlington, we had a round table with businesses. Many of them said, “Wow, we’re getting to understand more and more every day the importance of the ORPP.” They recognize that either we and they invest now in our population and in our citizens in the form of the ORPP or pay down the road when we have a whole generation of retirees with no retirement savings.", "As we move into phase 2 of our mandate, our government is continuing to build Ontario up by making investments that create jobs, expand opportunity and secure prosperity for the people in Burlington and, indeed, right across our province. We recognize that infrastructure investments in the GTHA and beyond are critical, as I mentioned, not just to improving the quality of people’s lives but to our business and our job creation.", "A final point, if I may, Speaker, is something of which I’m terribly proud, and that’s the investment in our Joseph Brant Hospital. We will have a brand new hospital by 2018 because of the investments that our government is making in the health and wellbeing of our citizens, particularly those in Burlington. This is creating jobs already and it will continue to attract jobs and investment to our community, and I’m enormously proud of that.", "Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity." ],

The concern is how quickly they are going to push this omnibus bill through the Legislature and probably time-allocate the debate and quickly put it through committee and bring it back and pass. That’s quite a concern.", "It’s interesting. When the government wants things done they do it quickly. However, we’re still waiting for our fall economic statement, which I believe is a few weeks behind. It would be nice to see where our finances are, because the Financial Accountability Officer just reported last week that it’s not looking like this government is going to reach their balance by 2017-18, and particularly not from selling Hydro One. It might give them a little bump, but in the long term Ontario is going to be worse off.", "I was glad to hear the Minister of Transportation speaking today about all the infrastructure projects. He’s clearly listening to the farmers in my area who are continuing to talk about this Glanworth bridge going forward, the underpass which the ministry consultants want to take out. They talk about how strong infrastructure investment is in this province but I think infrastructure investment also includes rural Ontario and the farmers. They need their necessary infrastructure—their bridges, their roads—aside from the major arteries of our local communities, because the farm equipment is so large nowadays and the trucks on and off the road are so numerous.", "The agricultural sector, I think, is our number one industry in this province. It’s consistent, it provides plenty of jobs and it helps local, small, rural communities stay afloat. This government needs to ensure that when they’re making decisions out of Toronto, that the local needs are met.", "A group of farmers and I are fighting to stop this government from getting rid of a major underpass for Highway 401 for our farmers. We hope the government is going to listen. We have slowed them down in the decision-making and we hope that in the next little while we’ll hear some good news that they are supporting rural Ontario and the agricultural community." ],

He did say, for the record, on May 26, 2014, when speaking with CBC Radio, that Kitchener will see “GO train service that runs every 15 minutes between Waterloo region and Toronto ... within five years.” This was a direct quote. This was said just prior to the election. And then there was also the environmental assessment and the scandal associated with that, and then the bullet train and what have you.", "But what I really want to say, though, is that I share the concerns of the member from Kitchener Centre when she says that that train is not fast enough, because adding slow trains doesn’t solve the issue. What the Minister of Transportation did not address is the false choice that Bill 144 puts before us. As an omnibus budget measures act, it contains, really, the first clues so far disclosed as to how the government intends to fill the hole it has created with the OEFC.", "This is actually coming from Tom Adams’s blog:", "“What all of this means,” he goes on to say, “is that [the Premier’s] signature initiative to use the proceeds of the sale of Hydro One to build transit is to be achieved in part through the farcical finance of seizing revenue from another level of government. The amount of money is small in the scheme of things but it illustrates the government’s reliance on astrology and unicorn sightings to guide their electricity and transit plans.” I have to bring this to the floor of the Legislature because it is a false choice. You cannot say to the people of this province, “If we don’t sell Hydro One, you get no infrastructure.” That makes no sense whatsoever." ],

In fact, in budget after budget, Ontario not only met its deficit reduction targets every year but it substantially exceeded its deficit reduction targets every single year. No other government in Canada—not the Harper federal government, not the Alberta PC government and not the British Columbia Liberal government—has been able to replicate that feat. Ontario is the only one to have set and met its deficit reduction targets.", "This, of course, is very much congruent with our exercise when we first came into government to find, just like the federal government has found, that the balance was actually more than $5 billion short—$5.6 billion in Ontario’s case. Ontario didn’t complain about it, but we set about deficit reduction, achieved a balanced budget a year ahead of schedule and then ran, prior to the onset of the recession, three consecutive budget surpluses, which enabled this province to pay down long-term debt and to finance infrastructure.", "Much like the member for Kitchener–Waterloo has talked about—I don’t know whether she feels she can influence the railways, CP and CN—the need to upgrade the track bed and the bridges so that those trains can travel as fast as she described is really a key need.

I attended his media studio presentation a week or so ago, and he posed a question to the media present. As he said, why would the average person in Ontario care that, three years from now, there’s going to be another $3.5 billion added to the debt, coming from Mr. LeClair’s figures? He recognized and acknowledged that he had been given short shrift on getting data from this government. So he asked the question: Why would the average Ontarian care? Then he reminded all of us present that, during the last election, a promise was made by this present government to balance the books by 2017-18.", "As opposition leader Patrick Brown explained—this was in an interview he did with the Toronto Star—referring to the members opposite, “They’ve backed themselves into a corner. They have no way out other than to raise taxes or cut services,” in spite of what we’ve been hearing in debate this afternoon, adding, “They want to cut funding to doctors, close needed schools and raise hydro rates, all because of their incompetence.” Those three areas—health, education and electricity—are certainly part of the budget measures, as it was recently described, omnibus legislation.", "We are surprised that this government has not brought forward its fall economic statement. Therefore, we rely on the numbers from the Financial Accountability Officer. As Mr. LeClair explained: “Over the period from 2010-11 to 2014-15, Ontario reduced the deficit by an average of $0.9 billion per year. To achieve balance in 2017-18, the government plans to reduce the deficit by an average of $3.4 billion per year, a rate of improvement nearly four times greater than the pace of the past four years.” I don’t have my hopes up.

That’s not a good sign. And get this: Corporate tax revenue in the province of Ontario dropped by over 50%. We all think of those lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs.", "Mr. LeClair points out that at the same time, Ontario’s program spending—the kind of things we’re hearing in this Budget Measures Act—increased sharply by $11.5 billion in 2009-10 from the previous year. That’s a pretty big increase. That’s heading close to $12 billion—largely as a result of stimulus spending on shovel-ready infrastructure.", "And what do we hear today from Premier Wynne and the members opposite? When in doubt, spend again. Ramp up the infrastructure spending, the stimulus spending, the kind of spending we’re hearing about on subways, the kind of spending that encourages other levels of government, certainly at the municipal level, to dust off that old project that didn’t make sense 10 years ago. “Here comes the money”—lots of work for staff at the federal, provincial and Ontario level. It gives MPPs something to do: to come out and attend a ceremony and cut a ribbon.", "I have always questioned this concept of spending your way to prosperity. This was proven not to work under the Bob Rae government. You cannot spend your way to prosperity. We saw it with this government five years ago, with stimulus spending that didn’t work. We saw it with Bob Rae. That was 25 years ago. It didn’t work, back in the day, with Bob Rae. What you end up doing is you spend your way into a hole of debt. How do you get out of that hole? Stop spending. Granted, it certainly may have created a lot of government jobs. It did pave a few roads. I know some arenas were constructed. But it really had no lasting effect, in my opinion, on Ontario’s unemployment rate. Granted, it does buy a few votes for government members who have the wherewithal to show up with these cheques.", "Here we go again with the federal government. Just last Friday, we heard, “Canadians have given our government a strong mandate”—I think I just heard that this afternoon, at the provincial level—“to take a new approach to securing our prosperity.” This gets back to the magical, whimsical secret to prosperity.

This sounds so familiar from what I’ve been hearing in the last couple of budgets. “That includes”—here it comes—“transformative investments in infrastructure and a new plan for a strong middle class.” That’s quite a ring to it. I think we’ve heard this before.", "Obviously, Ottawa is going to press ahead with stimulus spending in a weak economy. It’s already pushing the budget further into debt; they promised to balance in four years. The federal plan—again, we read this in the media this Friday—is going to focus on transportation; fighting climate change—I see some similarity here; adding new housing units—I don’t know whether he’s heard what this government plans to do with the taxation.", "Morneau did an interview in Turkey quite recently. I’ll quote him again: “The campaign commitment around infrastructure spending was a very important part of our commitment, and we will be moving forward”—moving forward, that’s a good phrase—“on that commitment in a fashion that will ensure that we find the right projects”—that goes back to the shovel-ready, trying to find some project that somebody put together maybe five years ago that never saw the light of day—“to make a real difference for the Canadian economy.”", "So find those right projects, dust off those proposals. Our municipal partners are probably going to get, I don’t know, maybe a few weeks’ notice. They’re going to have to scramble. Hopefully, those municipalities that like to spend money on projects they would never fund themselves—I hope they have some projects ready so they don’t miss the boat when the big money starts to flow.", "Going back to the Financial Accountability Officer’s report, as he states, “Ontario’s economic growth over the past eight years has been largely driven by household spending, residential investment”—you don’t want to tax that, by the way—“and government expenditures,” not driven by auto, not driven by steel or mining or forestry or agriculture. He goes on to report, “On average, net trade and business investment have been a drag on overall economic growth since 2007.” This is in Ontario.", "“In 2000”—I was an MPP back then under Mike Harris—“Ontario merchandise exports to the US represented 9.8% of total US imports. By 2014, Ontario’s share”—here we come—“had dropped to just 5.5%.” Again, the numbers don’t lie. This was presented by Mr. LeClair.", "I really feel it’s important to recognize that in any analysis, any debate on this Budget Measures Act, we have to be cognizant of the long-term unemployment problem that has worsened in the province of Ontario compared to even before the recession. It remains at 19%, long-term unemployment. These are people who may never work again. It’s six percentage points higher than prior to the recession, and we know for the long-term unemployed, it really does damage to their long-term future, essentially.", "How did all this Liberal taxing and spending affect employment? Well, under McGuinty—a big spender during the good times that had been created previously by the Mike Harris regime—the unemployment rate stayed static from 2003-08, after which it rose to 9% in 2009. It kind of drifted back to 7.8% in 2012. We’re now sitting at a 7.3% unemployment rate. Mr. McGuinty’s predecessor, a Premier named Harris, cut income taxes by 30% and saw unemployment drop from 8.7% in 1995 to 5.8% in 2000, inched up a bit to 6.9% in 2003.", "Fast-forward to this year—and it is hard to get up-to-date data because we had the budget, but we don’t have any fall economic statement. January to May—I think this is important when we’re talking about government spending across the way—the average wage settlement of 1.5% for Ontario’s broader public sector employees is the highest increase in four years. I don’t know whether this is going to be a continuing trend. We’ve all witnessed the teacher negotiations. We saw the money changing hands, but we haven’t been given the real costs of those deals that were struck.", "Then we questioned where the spending is on priorities like health and education. Health care spending is limited to 1.7% a year, well below the 3% that we have seen in past years with this present government. This partly explains the measures to cut physician fees and the move towards activity-based hospital funding. It’s important for all of us to continue to talk to doctors and hospitals in our areas about this.", "Education spending is projected to grow by less than half the base of the past four years. Good luck with that one; we’ll see how that works out. How will they accomplish that? Well, closing schools, for one; that’s one way to cut spending in the education sector. Obviously, it’s not by finding savings and not achieving this net zero that we hear about, by finding savings in compensation, salaries and benefits.", "I’ll just wrap up. I think I mentioned this in my two-minute presentation: Ontario has a $300-billion debt. It’s now sitting at 40% of our gross domestic product. Let’s listen to what Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s have to say about that." ],

They didn’t ask the public. They didn’t do it. That’s the first problem. The other situation: they didn’t anticipate that their own person—the government refused to co-operate with the Financial Accountability Officer. The FAO could not get a copy of Ed Clark’s analysis of the sale, even though a guiding principle of the Ed Clark panel was that the decision process remain transparent, professional and independently validated. You have to ask yourself what this government is afraid of that they don’t put out the numbers, open up the process and consult with the public.

How ironic is it that you’re talking about selling a public asset that brings us revenue to help support our public services and, “We think that’s okay because we’re going to own 40%. That makes it all okay, because we’re not selling it all. We’re better than the Harris government, because they sold off the 407, but we’re only selling 60%.

Forty percent is not ownership in the public hands.", "The other thing: I was disappointed today; I was actually kind of deflated.

I heard one of the members—I think it was Mr. Fedeli there from Nipissing—talking about how awful this is, and that he brought forward the numbers on the gas plants when the previous Premier Dalton McGuinty said that it was only $40 million; that’s all it cost to cancel these contracts. And he was saying, “No, no, no. I had evidence. I had proof.” He’s also saying this now. We’ve been talking about it, too. Really, we led the charge; the NDP leads the charge when it comes to not selling public assets. But today, he just happened to be talking about it in his debate for an hour. It was really well received. You should really hear it again. He was talking about, “Don’t do this because the numbers don’t add up, the numbers aren’t correct.”", "The House leader was saying, “Well, that’s not what the mandate of the people told me,” and the member from Barrie was saying something, and the House leader said, “Well, she got elected.

The Conservatives—the Conservatives—don’t want you to sell off hydro.

I would like to say at the outset that our government—and I’m sure I speak for all members of the House—is always concerned when students are out of the classroom and not learning, for whatever reason. That is why the government asked the Education Relations Commission to advise as to whether this school year is in jeopardy in light of the strikes that were taking place in Durham, Sudbury and Peel.", "Earlier this week, the Education Relations Commission advised that the school year is indeed in jeopardy for secondary students in Durham, Sudbury and Peel. In light of this advice, we introduced legislation that would have put our students back into the classroom yesterday, had the third party agreed to unanimous consent for speedy passage of this bill. This legislation is designed to get 72,000 students back into the classroom so that they can complete their studies for this year.", "We did not and we do not take this decision lightly. It was informed by the advice of the Education Relations Commission, and it’s a real response to the concerns of students and their parents in these communities.", "Mr. Speaker, as you would well be aware, the Ontario Labour Relations Board has weighed in on these matters, as well, and has also ruled now that the local strikes in Durham, in Sudbury and in Peel are indeed unlawful. Students and teachers are back in the classroom today. The OLRB has ordered that the local strikes in Durham, Sudbury and Peel must stop, and that stoppage involves a moratorium for at least two weeks.", "Our proposed legislation will allow students the opportunity to successfully complete their school year without any further disruption. I think that’s what we all want. This legislation ensures that students remain in school for the rest of this school year. We must ensure that students in the affected school boards that I’ve mentioned have the same opportunity to complete their school year.", "The Ministry of Education has been working with these boards on a daily basis to ensure the remaining days of the school year will be used for learning.", "Our government believes this legislation is necessary because we do not want those strikes that have been deemed to be unlawful to continue after the two-week moratorium has expired.", "This is about protecting the school year for students, ensuring our students continue to achieve excellence. It’s unfortunate that one party in the House continues to hold up that legislation, and I say that sincerely. I’m calling on the members of that party to help us protect the school year for students, join with the rest of us that are ready to move ahead, and make sure those students get back into the classrooms and stay there until the end of the school year." ],

Well, the kids are back to school because of the OLRB decision. So we’re debating what is a moot law, in a way. But not altogether, Speaker, because what this law is now doing is, it’s back-to-work legislation in case the teachers go on strike again. That’s what this is.", "So if you have pre-emptive back-to-work legislation, one has to ask the question: Is the government really serious about the negotiations? It’s hard to negotiate when one of the parties has, figuratively speaking, a gun to the other party’s head. In a way, this OLRB decision gives the government a second chance because now they have a bit of breathing room to actually truly negotiate. So in a way, this is a good thing.", "One issue that we really take exception to—the Minister of Education, during question period a few days ago, basically lobbed it on to the third party that this was all our fault. The last time I checked, Speaker, this was a majority government. I can remember, when the Premier was campaigning for leader, that she was going to do things differently. I’d really like to make this clear: We are at the eleventh hour of this issue, but we are dealing with a majority government that seems to be spinning their wheels with these labour negotiations. It’s this government, because of their lack of will of negotiation, that has kept the children from going to class. At the last minute, to say, “Well, it’s obviously the third party”—the third party in a majority government? Come on, now. We try and do as much as we can to make regulations and laws as effective as we can for the people who we represent; I think all members in the House do that. But let’s be clear: This is a majority government, a majority government whose Premier and whose Minister of Education could have fully seen this coming. This should not be news.", "Quite frankly, Speaker, the idea that “Well, it’s obviously the third party because they wouldn’t support that unanimous consent motion”—we didn’t support unanimous consent because we believe that everything in this House, in a democratic society, should be debated.

Quite frankly, the facts are in and the results are plain: We need newcomers as much as they need us. We are asking people to come from around the world to become members of our family, to help our province grow and achieve our goals, but what are we doing to welcome, protect and see newcomers thrive in this province?", "I want to spend some time talking about the reality of immigration by taking a moment to look at the numbers and current trends.

This number also illustrates that Ontario continues to be the first choice for immigrants coming to Canada. That’s really something to be proud of. To have people come from countries all over the world and settle in Ontario is a testament to what Ontario has to offer to its citizens in many ways. We’re talking about health care, education—at one time, there were job opportunities that were very plentiful.", "We saw our share of immigrants to Canada drop by almost one third. Markedly, in 2010, Ontario received 118,114 permanent residents, representing 42.1% of total admissions to Canada, which was well below our historical average. This was Ontario’s lowest share in 30 years, from a high of almost 60% in 2001 to 40% in 2011.", "Toronto, in particular, seems to have the greatest draw for those immigrating to Canada. According to Statistics Canada, Toronto’s metro population has now surpassed six million people, meaning that Toronto alone accounts for 17% of Canada’s 35 million people. They further claim that the main driver of this growth was foreign immigrants. In fact, every Canadian city with a population over one million can attribute most of its population growth to international migration. About half of the people living in Toronto were born in other countries, and this city is said to be the most multicultural city in the world.", "In spite of this uptake in immigration numbers in our major cities, it is estimated that Ontario will face a shortage of 364,000 skilled workers by the year 2025. That translates into an immigration demand that exceeds our current intake by more than twice over in order to offset the decline in Ontario’s labour force.", "What is behind this decline in Ontario’s labour force? Well, the answer is socially driven. Our baby boomers are coming of retirement age at a rate we simply can’t keep up with. Combine that with our historical decline in fertility rates and the picture becomes a little clearer, all of which points to a steady decline of Canadian participation in our own labour force.", "Historically, economic growth has been the key driver behind labour requirements in Canada. However, it will no longer be the case in the coming years. Instead, job openings due to retirement will be the major driver behind labour demand in the future, far outpacing the number of new jobs created by economic expansion. Projections from Human Resources and Skills Development Canada indicate that roughly 6.4 million jobs will open up in the coming decade. Roughly 70% of these jobs will be due to replacement demand, primarily as a result of retirements, deaths and emigration, while the remaining 30% will come from new economic activity and the demand for new labour requirements.", "Simply stated, this trend is driven by our changing societal demographics. The slowing in our overall population expansion and the aging of the population are clearly beginning—and will continue—to negatively impact our labour force growth.", "In the coming decade, we will need to recognize the labour market challenges of replacement demand. In the coming decade, there will be a need for approximately 4.4 million jobs. Some 3.7 million vacancies will be caused by retirements. It is estimated that the number of Canadians expecting to retire is going to increase steadily over the next decade. In 2010, we experienced approximately 300,000 retirements. By 2010, it is estimated that number will rise to more than 415,000. Further, it is estimated that an additional 700,000 positions will need to be filled due to death prior to retirement, and to emigration.", "Therefore, it is vital that we appreciate and understand the importance of our immigration strategy beyond our labour market demand, but our socio-cultural needs as well.", "Our demographics and populations are changing, and immigration will play a vital role in supplementing our workforce. Researchers have estimated that within this decade, immigration will account for all the net growth in our working-age population. By that, I don’t mean to infer that Canadian-born individuals will not make any contributions to our labour force, because, Speaker, we know we have highly educated, highly trained people in Canada and in Ontario as well. The majority of the new entrants into the labour force will be made up of those who are leaving school. While newcomers will continue to be a vital aspect of our labour supply in Ontario, it has also been noted that recent immigrants seem to have the weakest economic outcomes, despite having very high levels of education attainment.", "These concerns are significant. If declining financial outcomes among recent immigrants persist, we must be ready to respond. Whether it is a moral imperative that drives us to address those needs, or an economic inclination, it is clear that it serves us well as a province to ensure that immigrants in Ontario are provided with every opportunity to succeed.", "The growing demands in health care, specifically in the caregiver program, highlight our need for an adaptive immigration strategy. We have seen some changes to policy, specifically the provincial nominee program, which is designed to facilitate immigration of foreign nationals to specific provinces and territories in Canada in order to target explicit economic needs.", "Yet we struggle to adapt to our policy changes. While seeking to facilitate this immigration, we have yet to move towards a fully comprehensive system of recognition of foreign-trained professionals and their credentials. Individuals who immigrate to Canada under the provincial nominee program have the skills, education and work experience needed to make an immediate economic contribution to the province or territory which nominates them. Since the inception of this program, the focus has been on immediate occupational needs identified by the participating provinces. The provincial nominee program rules recognize that provincial governments are best positioned to determine their own specific economic needs with respect to immigration. Labour market needs vary over time due to a number of factors, such as general economic cycles, rates of growth in particular sectors and demographics in particular occupations. Generally, the program is viewed as being more responsive to more immediate needs in the labour market as compared to the Federal Skilled Worker program.", "PNP applicants receive priority processing while most FSW applicants do not, and the PNP is broader based in terms of the occupational labour market field. Since the inception of the PNP, comparisons regarding labour market outcomes of the FSW program are often made. However, one must remember important differences between the two economic streams of immigration. The FSW program addresses knowledge-based and longer-term needs for skilled professionals, whereas the PNP tends to focus on short-term occupational and specific labour needs identified by a province.", "Speaker, there’s something too I want to share, and I did touch on it when I debated earlier. It was some information that was gathered through the Auditor General’s report, so I just want to read from that. Some of them are quotes that we got from the Auditor General’s report.", "Last year, the Auditor General did a comprehensive review of Ontario’s provincial nominee program and, quite frankly, uncovered some serious issues in the ministry. I’ll read the quote from the report, which I’ve written out here:", "“The provincial nominee program ... is delivered by the Ministry of Citizenship, Immigration and International Trade. Through the program, immigrants are nominated, or recommended, to the federal government based on their potential economic contributions to the province. Since the program’s inception in 2007, the province has nominated about 6,600 people. As of April 30, 2014, 3,900 nominees and 3,200 of their family members have become permanent residents through the program.", "“Other significant findings included the following:", "“The ministry delayed formally reporting potential abuse of the program to the federal government and the appropriate law enforcement agencies.” So that was a concern. “This potentially delayed any action against people who might have been abusing the program.", "“Program staff did not follow up on questionable files that were approved but flagged for follow-up. About 260 files were flagged between October 2011 and November 2013, but only 8% had been followed up on at the time of our audit.” That’s the Auditor General. “As of April 2014, 71% of all nominees flagged for follow-up had become landed immigrants.", "“Thirty immigrant representatives submitted applications that were denied on the basis that they contained misleading or fraudulent information.", "“On a follow-up of previous approved foreign worker nominees who had become landed immigrants to Ontario, 38% of the sampled nominees were suspected to have misrepresented themselves.", "“Even though the ministry says publicly that the applications are processed on a first-come, first-served basis, certain applications were given priority and processed at least three times faster than others.", "“There are significant data integrity issues with the program’s computer system. Controls over the case management system and nomination certificates need to be strengthened.” This is what the Auditor General is talking about, Speaker.", "“In 2013, two thirds of the nominees were international students who obtained a post-secondary degree in Ontario but did not have a job offer at the time of nomination.”", "Of specific note for me were the “significant data integrity issues with the program’s computer system” coupled with the fact that there was no privacy officer assigned to work with the program. Bill 49 is seeking to allow the minister to have access to highly confidential and personal information, and yet neither the government nor this ministry demonstrated that they have the capacity to protect the privacy of the individuals participating in the program.", "In fact, this government program can’t even report on the effectiveness of the program, nor can it speak to the experience of those people who have previously been nominated through the program.", "The Auditor General also found “there is a significant risk that the program might not always be nominating qualified individuals who can be of economic benefit to Ontario. This is because it lacks the necessary tools, including policies, procedures and training, to guide program staff to make consistent and sound selection decisions, especially in a work environment that relies heavily on temporary staff and where turnover is high.”", "This is, again, what the Auditor General has identified as problematic to delivering this program.", "They also found “that the ministry did not share program integrity concerns with both internal staff and external parties”—including law enforcement and regulators—“who needed to know and could act on them accordingly.”", "Furthermore, they found “that program staff had not been provided with clear guidelines on how to deal with potentially fraudulent situations, and the program had not established anti-fraud mechanisms. The program lacks a strong data management system and program integrity function that would help detect high-risk applications. The program’s evaluations have not been thorough and current enough to track what happens to nominees from the various program components after they are selected.”", "So it’s almost like there was never any follow-up to this program to see if it was working, if it was successful or what the outcomes were for people who entered through this program.", "“Furthermore, the ministry does not have strong monitoring procedures to ensure that” all “nominees are indeed working in skilled occupations contributing to the economy after arrival”—so, again, checks and balances.", "These are fairly damning findings to overcome while asking for our support in this chamber to afford greater powers to this unproven ministry. Yes, you’re asking for all kinds of extra authority, but the track record that has been reported by the Auditor General is not a glowing report.", "This Premier and this government tout themselves as champions of transparency and accountability. We all know where we can go with that, but I’m going to stay here on the debate. Yet the Auditor General went on to say, “The program lacks processes to ensure transparency and avoid actual or perceived conflicts of interest: Even though the ministry states publicly that applications are processed on a first-come, first-served basis, certain applications are given priority and processed at least three times faster than non-prioritized files. Although there might be instances where this practice would be justified, for example, when an applicant’s legal status to stay in Canada is about to lapse,” they noted “one situation where files submitted by a certain representative were prioritized. In this case, the representative was a former program employee. In addition, some representatives were contacting program staff directly to ask for extensions in submitting documents or to request that their clients’ applications be prioritized.” It sounds like one process for the well-connected and another for the rest of us.", "“In contrast, at Citizenship and Immigration Canada, only a small number of people deal with representatives, and representatives can only make inquiries in writing.”", "These were the kinds of proposals my party sought to introduce through the committee, proposals that would help instill fairness and transparency while creating a level playing field for all. Yet once again, only two out of our 13 amendments were accepted.", "It’s very ironic that the ministry responsible for helping immigrants land and find employment are themselves, in many cases, temporary employees. I’ll illustrate that, in my debate, from the Auditor General’s findings. According to the Auditor General’s report, many staff received no written guidance or job training, and turnover is quite high.", "“As of March 31, 2014, only 20% of program staff were permanent full-time ministry employees.... From January 2012 to June 2014, 31 staff left the program and 59 started with the program.” There’s that high turnover rate.", "The program “is heavily staffed with temporary or short-term employees. This has contributed to increased turnover and the risk of inconsistent decision-making, which in turn requires increased oversight and continual training.", "“When the program began, it was approved to hire up to nine full-time positions or the equivalent” of full-time employees (FTEs). “At that time, the nomination limit was 500.”", "So you’d have your nine full-time employees and your nomination limit was 500 applicants coming in.", "“In 2014, approved staffing increased to 16 FTEs when the nomination limit reached 2,500.” That’s a huge number. You’re going from 500 as a nomination limit to 2,500 as a nomination limit, and the increment in employees didn’t really proportion out that increase in nomination limit. At the time of the audit, the program was only utilizing nine of the 16 FTEs, so again, these people were obviously very overworked.", "“In order to meet staffing needs, the ministry redeployed its staff from other programs and staff from one other ministry. In addition, in 2010, the program began seconding people from the federal government, and in 2012, it began to hire seasonal employees,” and that is full-time employees on annually recurring fixed-term contracts who work 10 months of the year. “These temporary staff are not included in the approved staffing complement of 16, but the ministry has obtained funding to cover the costs of the temporary workforce.", "“As of March 31, 2014, the program had 45 staff in total” and “expects to continue to employ a mix of permanent and seasonal staff, but dependence on a temporary workforce could result in more turnover because staff may leave, as has happened, for more permanent positions elsewhere.” More secure jobs: That’s what people are looking for.", "“From January 2012 to June 2014, 31 staff left the program. In the same period, 59 individuals started with the program, excluding returning seasonal staff.” This illustrates that instability created a risk “to the program of inconsistency in decision-making, which warrants increased oversight and constant training of staff.” Again, the irony of the employees to this program working under precarious employment conditions themselves while helping newcomers to find good, stable employment would be amusing if it wasn’t so unfair.", "In addition, although the program has existed for more than eight years, the ministry still does “not have an operating manual to guide processing staff in making consistent eligibility decisions.” That was something that was very much brought to the forefront from the Auditor General: training and guidelines for staff who are actually going through these nomination applications. Moreover, at the start of the audit, none of the application-processing staff who assessed files had received any training specific to the program. So you’re thrown in the job.", "What has changed that will inspire Ontarians and newcomers alike to trust your leadership and program management abilities? That would be something I would actually like to talk to the minister about, or even get something in writing: What steps has he taken from the Auditor General’s findings to get his ministry clerically up to date, training his staff and to ensure people are going to, first of all—hopefully, when they come to work there—gain skills and experience? That’s what makes the employee valuable, or someone who works for you: The longer they’re there, the better they are at their job. So it would be nice to know what steps they’ve taken to ensure that when people get that job, they are willing to stay for the long haul. That also asks: What will be different under Bill 49? What is the government’s response to its own shortcomings as an employer?", "I’d like to talk a little bit about caregivers because, again, in Ontario we have a need for caregivers. Many, many of those caregivers come to Ontario; they immigrate here. I think that’s something that we need to highlight in Ontario and talk about, and make sure that it’s on record.", "When we talk about caregivers, we want to know what answers this government has for their own employees, let alone those newcomers facing the precarious work that we talked about, as in the case of Ontario’s live-in caregivers. Live-in caregivers are predominantly immigrant women, coming to us from countries around the world. They work in people’s homes providing vital care and nurturing our aging population, young children and people with disabilities. They come here as temporary foreign workers, without access to full immigration status.", "On one hand, we are clearly aware of the needs and demands of our aging population, yet our federal counterparts have approved fewer than 10% of requests by potential employers to bring in foreign caregivers under their revised program. They face enormous challenges, and in some cases abuse, while our labour laws exclude many of their working conditions. Last November in Ontario, there was an on-the-job death of a Filipino nanny, Marites Angana. Marites came to Ontario to take a job as a live-in caregiver but suffered a head injury from a fall in her employer’s garage on November 28. She died of a brain hemorrhage on December 2 at Toronto Western Hospital, leaving behind a 13-year-old son in the Philippines.", "Speaker, this is not an unusual story for a foreign caregiver coming into Ontario. As I have said, the majority of caregivers are women. Many of them come here to support their extended family or their own immediate children, who are left at home in their countries. To listen to this story—to have Marites fall in the garage and end up suffering death because of this, and leaving her 13-year-old son, certainly isn’t the only story in Ontario with regard to caregivers.", "My office met with friends of Marites and several groups who were seeking to help with repatriation of her body and wanting to prevent this needless tragedy from happening again. We challenged Ontario’s Ministry of Labour to look into the circumstances of Marites, even going as far as to call for a coroner’s inquest into the death, but have heard nothing but silence in return. We haven’t heard any response to that request.", "According to the International Labour Organization, “Domestic workers are frequently expected to work longer hours than other workers and do not have the same rights to weekly rest that are enjoyed by other workers.” They go on to state that some 83% of domestic workers are women.", "We know that live-in caregivers are playing a key role in providing this care in Ontario, yet they are treated unfairly by both federal and provincial governments. This begs the question I referred to earlier about what kind of immigration strategies are we promoting here in Ontario. This government continues to refuse to bring legislation forward that protects temporary foreign workers in their work environments. There has been no action taken by the Ministry of Labour in regard to protecting the workplaces of Ontario’s live-in caregivers, or to address the precarious nature of their work, yet we have very high expectations for the people we charge to care for our children and our aging parents.", "Speaker, if you were going to have a caregiver—I’ll speak from my personal experience. If I was going to have a caregiver in my home looking after my parents or my children, I certainly would want to make sure that they were happy in what they did and that they had all the rights of someone working in another workplace, because their role—you can’t have a more important career or work than looking after someone who is a child or a vulnerable senior, because your care is in their hands. So I think it’s so important that we actually look at foreign caregivers and try to make their workplaces fair.", "With the care of caregivers, we know that they are predominantly women, as we’ve said, and yet where is our moral obligation to promote their well-being and the status of all women in Ontario? Under the new rules, caregivers will no longer have universal access to permanent resident status after working in Canada for two years—again, a change like that isn’t helping. They must now apply under two categories: those caring for children, and those caring for people with high medical needs. Ottawa will now allow 2,750 caregivers under both new streams to access permanent residency, for a total of 5,500 applicants a year. The annual average of caregivers who came to Canada over the past five years is over 8,000. That’s well above the cap that Ottawa has set.", "So how will Ontario seek to reconcile the federal regulations with the needs of Ontarians? A recent study shows that today as much as 80% of the home care services provided to older adults come from caregivers. However, as the baby boomer generation ages and as they didn’t have as many children as their parents, the same in-family resources will simply not be available.", "I know that my parents, when they came to Canada with five children—yes, it was five—they came to Ontario. We lived here in Ontario with five children." ],

So I’m going to speak from my perspective. When my father came to Canada and Ontario, and my uncles and all kinds of relatives, they didn’t have any skills. They were labourers, they were farmers, back in their country. Things were a little different then. They came to Ontario, and thank goodness that was allowed, because you guys wouldn’t have me here today if that wasn’t the case.", "Despite the fact that they didn’t have any high skills to fill the labour market that they’re going to be doing research and developing programs for—and that is certainly something we need to do—they had a role to fill in this province. They contributed to the workforce and they actually helped build Ontario, specifically in the construction trade that my family was able to enter. So if it wasn’t for that opportunity for immigrants who came here without skills, they couldn’t have helped contribute to the economy.", "And they thrived. My father bought a home. He bought a car. He contributed back to society. We brought five over. My youngest brother was born here. He raised six kids here. We’re all here. We have children. We’re all working and contributing. So that’s something, Speaker, that they’re talking about, this bill, the provincial nominee program, as looking at economic class drivers for nominating people coming to Ontario. I think there should be some room in here for people who come here who perhaps don’t have those skills that they’re looking for but can contribute in other ways.", "Back to home care: We know that Ontarians are already confronting wait-lists for home care, bed shortages in our long-term-care facilities. The federal government claimed that noticeable decreases in the number of applicants were due to higher proportions of the applications returned as incomplete. That’s what they’re saying about the caregiver applications limit that they changed, too.", "On Friday, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said he “doesn’t want to create a permanent underclass in Canada because of problems with the temporary foreign worker program.” Yet it was his government that increased the cost of applications to the program. Previously the application cost was just $275. The new cost is $1,000, along with the labour market study. Now accessibility is becoming an issue when you raise that application fee that much.", "Harper seems adept at posturing on the case of the Filipino immigration while he’s actively seeking new trade deals with their country’s leaders, all of which will result in increased demand for government and private home care services and, ultimately, caregivers.", "Yet this government has been silent on the cuts to the caregiver programs. There is no evidence that advocacy of any kind has taken place to protect either the caregivers or those Ontarians who are in need of their services. This Liberal government needs to accept the consequences for their part in creating and establishing a permanent group of second-class citizens. If they don’t react now, it’s just going to keep growing.", "Speaker, we talked about the Auditor General’s report and how there’s a fluctuation of staff in and out of the door, how there are people on contract.

That work goes back to when the Attorney General, the member from Ottawa–Vanier—who was the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services—almost three years ago, started the process of retaining the expertise of Dr. Rosen from the University of British Columbia, to procure an expert report that could help guide us as to how best to treat marine mammals. So this work has been ongoing. I want to thank the Attorney General for her contributions and, of course, the staff at the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services for their hard work.", "In Bill 80, the government has taken a considered and balanced path that recognizes the characteristics of the orca and the need to strengthen protections and oversight for all marine mammals.

That is why we are prohibiting the breeding and acquisition of orcas in Ontario, if Bill 80 is passed.", "We are establishing a statutory framework so that animal care committees and other administrative measures can be required, and so that marine mammals remaining in captivity receive expert care, to ensure that they receive the best possible quality of care.", "Before I pass the floor to the member from Scarborough–Rouge River, I want to say in conclusion that our government is committed to making sure that marine mammals and all animals in Ontario are protected and receive the best possible treatment and care. Prohibiting the future possession and breeding of orcas, and moving forward on standards of care that will be among the best in the world, is something that Ontarians expect and that these animals deserve.", "Thank you, Speaker." ],

Failure to do so could result in penalties and/or imprisonment of up to $60,000 and up to two years upon conviction, and up to $250,000 and two years upon failure to comply with a court order.", "Kiska, the only orca currently in Ontario, will be allowed to remain at her home in Marineland in Niagara Falls. This bill does not require her to be relocated to another facility.", "Speaker, the strength of any bill lies in the power to enforce. Ontario has the strongest animal protection legislation in Canada. New investment by our government has enabled the OSPCA and its affiliates to strengthen enforcement by:", "—improving coverage to underserved areas of the province, such as rural and northern Ontario;", "—creating a major case management team that is responsible for coordinating investigations that require specialized expertise;", "—introducing a 24/7 centralized dispatch service, to ensure timely responses to complaints of animal abuse and neglect across the province; and", "—establishing regular inspections of all zoos and aquariums, and developing a registry of those facilities to support the inspection process.", "I am pleased to report that every zoo and aquarium in Ontario is inspected at least twice annually since our support for this program began.", "If passed, Bill 80 will grant the OSPCA the authority to demand that facilities provide records and other information respecting compliance with prescribed standards of care or administrative requirements, within a specified time frame. This would help to ensure that prescribed standards are being met.", "The bill also proposes to clarify that OSPCA authority to inspect a facility includes all places where animals are kept, if they are being kept for the purposes of exhibition, entertainment, boarding, hire or sale. This includes places where animals are kept in the off-season.", "Bill 80, if passed, would expand existing regulation-making authority. It would allow for the establishment of additional standards that could include requiring management oversight practices, professional services, and the collecting and disclosing of information intended to ensure appropriate levels of care of any animal, including marine mammals.", "The proposed legislation would pave the way for animal welfare committees to be established at non-research zoos, aquariums and other facilities that keep animals. These committees would provide the necessary oversight to help ensure the long-term well-being of animals in each facility’s care.", "For marine mammals, this oversight could include producing a written animal management plan, and producing a written veterinary care program, which could include an annual physical examination for each marine mammal. In addition, animal welfare committees could assist in addressing appropriate human interaction with marine mammals at an exhibition park.", "Related amendments to the Animals for Research Act ensure that facilities governed by that act are subject to the same prohibitions of orcas as zoos and aquariums.", "The people of Ontario demand the highest standards of care and enforcement for all animals, regardless of their habitat. Public confidence in the well-being of marine mammals is a critical issue for our government. Bill 80, if passed, gives the public assurances that Ontario is taking the necessary steps to ensure the best possible care and well-being of marine mammals in captivity.", "We would be ensuring that no new orcas come into the province. We would be setting tough new penalties for individuals or entities that might try to violate this prohibition. We would be strengthening the protection of animals in captivity by supporting the inspection and enforcement authority of the OSPCA.", "Bill 80, if passed, would complete our government’s three-point plan introduced in 2012 to ensure Ontario continues to have the strongest animal protection legislation in Canada. It would build on the work we started in 2009 with the first major overhaul of the OSPCA Act in 90 years.", "In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the minister for his work in bringing this bill forward, members of the committee and all those who came to speak before the committee. I urge all of my colleagues in the Legislature to support this important piece of legislation as we take the next step in ensuring the protection of marine mammals in our province, because that is what Ontarians expect and these animals deserve." ],

That was job number one.", "Job number two was to avoid closure of the facility. I’ll talk a bit more about the other case. Some feel that these facilities should be closed down. I do not, and I’m going to talk about the reasons why, including the economic benefit of having Marineland in my home area of Niagara and in the riding of my colleague from Niagara Falls.", "Third was the importance of the humane amendment to allow the last remaining orca, Kiska, to have a companion as opposed to what effectively in Bill 80 is a life sentence of isolation. I think that was wrong.", "Let me get into these issues one at a time, Speaker. We could have taken an ideological approach to this legislation but instead we chose—what I think is a sensible, a very balanced, pragmatic approach to ensure two things: We’d have world-class standards when it comes to animal welfare, and that we continue to have the jobs and investment that come from an active marine mammal park in Niagara Falls at Marineland.", "I know some would argue ideologically that the park should be able to do what it wants, that this is park property and the market would decide proper standards for animal care; the market would decide if standards are adequate or not important at all. We don’t subscribe to that ideological approach; in fact, I think my colleague would agree. We didn’t hear that from anybody at the committee either. It’s a point of view we disagree with.", "There is, on the other side of the coin, an ideological approach that says that animals of any kind should not be held in captivity. I know that there are Ontarians who subscribe to that view, Speaker. It’s their right to do so. I think that they are well-meaning and passionate, and they care deeply about animals and their welfare. They’ve come to the conclusion that facilities such as Marineland, the Metro zoo, the High Park Zoo should all be shut down. We also disagree with that point of view. We believe that institutions like Marineland play an important role not only in the jobs they create, but in allowing scientific study of animals, the educational opportunities, and I’ll discuss that more later.", "So we did not choose either of the ideological routes. We chose a very pragmatic, practical path based on the highest level of animal welfare standards. In fact, the government hired a renowned, respected expert in Dr. Rosen from the University of British Columbia. We commend that appointment. We agree with Dr. Rosen, as a highly qualified individual, to lead a review of those standards, and he produced a report to the government. In his report Dr. Rosen recommended the creation of—the adaptation was called the CCAC standards, the Canadian Council on Animal Care standards—a Canadian standard based on the latest available information and scientific research for animal welfare when it comes to creatures like cetaceans—dolphins, orcas, beluga whales and other mammals.", "The government did, in its regulatory approach, adopt the vast majority of those recommendations, except for one, and I’ll get to that later on, which I think was an unfortunate omission by the government that will sentence the orca Kiska to a lifetime of isolation.", "We thought this important, because we thought, “What does the average Ontarian think? What do we think?” And that is, if you’re going to have animals in captivity of any kind, you want to make sure you have the best standards in the world. I think that’s what Ontarians would demand. Then they’d have confidence that in the facility the animals are treated well, and they could enjoy the entertainment and educational aspects of Marineland—and, from that, the jobs. We thought the best approach in this bill was a sensible, balanced approach based on science—high standards, first and foremost. So we looked to the best science; we looked to expert opinion.", "Look, people who object to zoos can always choose not to attend. They don’t go; they don’t take their children. They can choose not to attend. But there are a million people in the summer who do, including me, my family, our neighbours. I take my daughter to Marineland, and hopefully I will get a chance to bring Maitland this year, along with Miller, to Marineland. There are a million visitors a year.", "Here’s something very important, too, that we shouldn’t lose sight of, for those who want to close the park down altogether for ideological reasons: They also include programs for kids with disabilities. Autism Ontario runs an important program through Marineland. Make-A-Wish has enabled 3,500 special-needs kids to achieve their dream—kids obviously in extraordinarily difficult circumstances and the families who want to go to Marineland; 3,500 have done so through Make-A-Wish.", "Some may disagree, but I also believe in my heart and my mind that if you see these majestic creatures up close, you get a greater appreciation for their life, a greater appreciation for the science, the nature of these mammals. I think there’s an important educational aspect to this that inspires a love for dolphins, orcas or seals etc. by seeing them up close and personal. I just don’t believe you get the same experience by watching it on TV or through the Internet. I know some people believe that; I don’t.", "Let’s explore that. If you went down that ideological path and you said, “We should close this down because we don’t believe marine mammals should be kept in captivity”—I know some people said that at the committee. They were honest and heartfelt. What would be the impact? Well, 700 people would lose their jobs, with indirect jobs in the thousands as well. Visitor spending as a result of Marineland in Niagara is about $152 million a year, and is the single biggest marketer of any institution, any facility, any government in the peninsula, at $4.5 million a year.", "So I understand the ideological approach of closing it down. I disagree with it. We can’t lose sight of the economic impacts. I think a better path is to have the highest standards possible and allow the park to operate. People will have confidence in it and it will continue to flourish, hire people and invest in the community.", "We brought forward amendments as part of this process to do just that, to make sure that the CCAC standards were the ones that are adopted by the government. We brought forward practical, science-based amendments to say that if the SPCA inspectors are going to go there to evaluate if an animal’s in distress, they should be trained in marine mammal biology, with some kind of certification process. I want to know that they know the difference between a dolphin and a dog, not just by looking at them or the spelling but by how their biology works." ],

Not one facility—not one single facility—uses that UK model. It’s called the UK model because they actually implemented it in the United Kingdom, and guess what? Every existing facility closed down because the standards could not be complied with if you still wanted to actually keep the facility open and keep the lights on.", "To their credit, those who are ideologically opposed to marine mammals or others in captivity are very clear. Dr. Rosen was one who spoke to this. He said, “In the case of the UK standards, they in fact did not close”—sorry: “They in fact did close down all the facilities in the UK”—let me read that cleanly. Dr. Rosen said, “In the case of the UK standards, they in fact did close down all the facilities in the UK, because they decided it wasn’t worth operating under those standards, and their profit margins shrank to the point where they didn’t think it was worth operating.” So they all closed down.", "Marineland says, “The only use of the UK model in the proposed standards is in relation to facility pool size.” All other standards are CCAC standards. So if you want the park to stay open, you have to reject the UK model—which, by the way, is not active anywhere, because it closes the place down.", "Dr. Rosen wrote us a letter. He couldn’t appear at the committee. Dr. Rosen said that instead of adopting the UK standards, “It is my opinion that what is required is a set of standards of care based upon verifiable best practices, informed by quantitative data produced and analyzed in a scientific manner. Fortunately, such a ‘natural experiment’ already exists within the variety of facilities and marine mammal species currently held in aquariums within North America.” He said, “This would provide the basis of a study of existing pool sizes and physical parameters measured against impartial criteria of animal health and well-being. Such an objective approach, initiated and supported by the government of Ontario, would place the province in the forefront of animal welfare practices and serve as a model for other jurisdictions.” Sounds pretty good—the government’s own expert.", "Mr. Nicholls, the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex, brought forth an amendment to do just so. Sadly, the government voted it down. They say that the UK standards are still on the table. I think that would be a mistake. By leaving it on the table, you undermine the investment in the community. You leave open the question: When they bring in the regulations, are they going to, by stealth, close the park down?", "I do call upon the parliamentary assistant and the minister to reject the UK model, unless you want to close it down. Don’t leave that question open—instead, a made-in-Ontario solution, as Dr. Rosen recommends, based on the latest scientific evidence and world-class standards, so we know that marine mammals at Marineland are treated the best anywhere in the world. Why won’t we take this opportunity to do so? That’s what we wanted, Speaker. Sadly, we didn’t get it.", "My last point—I know my colleagues want to speak to this—the third point: We brought forward an amendment to allow the minister, at his discretion or her discretion, under prescribed circumstances to allow Kiska, the last remaining orca, to have a companion. It is not easy being alone. This government’s bill is a life sentence of isolation for that animal. We think that’s wrong.", "The first big-kid movie I took my daughter, Miller, to wasn’t a cartoon; it was Dolphin Tale 2. A similar story: a dolphin in captivity in, I think, Florida, and they brought in another dolphin to keep her company, to make sure that her mental state was good. Why wouldn’t we leave the door open at the minister’s discretion to allow for a companion orca so Kiska does not spend the rest of her life isolated?", "Some say, “Move her out.” We heard evidence from the scientific community that that’s not possible, given her age and state of health. The only other option is to allow a companion. I worry that the government, in this bill, without that amendment, could actually legislate criminal activity by forcing cruelty to animals by a permanent life sentence of isolation. I don’t think that’s your intent. I say to the parliamentary assistant and the minister: I don’t think that’s what you want to do.", "It’s too bad they voted it down. Our position was clear: world-class standards based on the best available science, a made-in-Ontario solution based on the CCAC work that was already done; number two, a humane amendment to allow Kiska the killer whale, under prescribed circumstances, to have a companion and avoid a lifetime of isolation; and third and finally, Speaker, to reject a back-door attempt to close the park down with the UK model, outdated from 1986.", "They’re closing them down in the United Kingdom. I don’t want to see that. I want to see the best standards. I want to see people, including autistic children and those from Make-A-Wish Foundation, enjoy a place like Marineland—the educational value—and to ensure that we have world-class standards right here in the province of Ontario.

The origins of this bill predate my time at Queen’s Park, which shows you how long the changes have been needed. Regardless, I appreciate that changes are being made now.", "The intention of this bill is to strengthen the existing protections for marine mammals in Ontario’s marine parks and aquariums, as well as to provide new regulations for how large marine mammals can be observed or utilized for research. As members of provincial Parliament, we attempt to become educated on the various topics that we discuss in this chamber. But regardless of how extensive our research is, we are not the experts. Rather, we are representatives of the experts, and so I will bring some of the thoughts and submissions presented during committee.", "Committee was interesting, but I will come to that. Let’s look at the bill. The first few schedules of the bill deal with establishing new limitations around the selling, acquisition or breeding of orcas for captivity in Ontario; namely, the prohibition of all three. However, there are some exceptions that are also established within the bill. In section 3, subsection (1) states, “No person shall possess or breed an orca in Ontario.” In subsection (2), however, there is a caveat established that, “Despite subsection (1), a person may continue to possess an orca in Ontario if the person possessed the orca in Ontario on March 22, 2015,” or the day before this bill was introduced for first reading. The reason for this exception is Ontario’s single orca in captivity, Kiska, who currently lives at Marineland.", "Let me tell you a little bit about what I have learned about orcas. They are the largest whale kept in captivity. They travel the furthest and the fastest, and are uniquely unsuited to captivity. This is because there are unique challenges when it comes to keeping whales or dolphins, the biggest of which is attempting to replicate their natural environment. Orcas and other types of whales are also uniquely susceptible to stress, which can be amplified by a constrained environment.", "It has been reported that the average life expectancy of an orca in captivity is roughly 40 years, which is how old Kiska is, incidentally. However, life expectancy in the wild—", "Interjections." ],

What we do know is that Kiska’s well-being needs to be taken into account by the government, and they need to consult with the experts to ensure that this is reflected in their actions.", "Kiska has delighted families across Ontario for more than a generation. She has helped to put Marineland on the map. She is the face on T-shirts across the province. Arguably, she is the inspiration for this bill. We have learned a lot from Kiska. We have learned a lot from studies of cetaceans and large mammals in captivity, and that is why the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act has targeted its impact at orcas in captivity.", "During committee, we heard from experts, passionate voices and business interests. It was a very emotional committee, and coming from a family of animal lovers, I understand and appreciate the importance of speaking up for animals. There were conflicting opinions, competing information and decidedly divergent recommendations. I appreciated the hearings and the process, but they did not clarify many things. Quite frankly, I can’t imagine how the government can be so firm on some of their decisions without spending more time really consulting and researching.", "Some of the comments and recommendations that were presented in committee were to prohibit the importation into Ontario of all new wild-caught cetaceans because they, like orcas, have complex needs that can’t be met in captivity. All of the submissions agreed on the importance of Kiska’s best interests.", "I’ll be frank: We heard compelling stories and arguments on Kiska’s behalf, and we know that this government felt compelled to create this bill when, honestly, there are so many other animal welfare issues across the province. They could have easily chosen a broader issue but they chose this situation. They chose Kiska as their focus. It was clear that the government had touched base with many groups but did not consult at length with them. We heard that, time and time again.", "I don’t know what is best for Kiska. I have not even met Kiska. I’m not an expert. But those who work with her, those who visit and love her, those who advocate for her and those who care about her ought to be consulted and a strategy should be designed. There really ought to be a long-term-care plan for Kiska, and the government needs to be a part of it.", "I would like to read a section of a letter from Lynn Kavanagh, campaign manager from World Animal Protection Canada: “We applaud the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services in putting forward Bill 80 to prohibit the keeping of orcas and for establishing standards of care for marine mammals in captivity in Ontario. Decades of research have shown us that orcas don’t belong in captivity. As Minister Naqvi has said, for far-ranging, fast-moving and deep-diving predators, captive environments cannot even come close to meeting their needs.", "“Like orcas, other small cetaceans, such as belugas and dolphins, also have vast home ranges and, like orcas, are highly intelligent, extraordinarily social and behaviourally complex. These qualities and their corresponding needs mean these animals become stressed and suffer in captivity.", "“Thus, World Animal Protection joins Zoocheck and the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies in the opinion that Bill 80 does not go far enough in its protection of marine mammals. We ask that the importation of wild-caught individuals of other cetacean species also be prohibited.”", "Certainly, the focus of Bill 80, the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act, has targeted its impact to orcas in captivity, but the reach of the bill is far broader than that. Under this bill, the minister’s regulation-making authority would also be expanded to include prescribing administrative requirements related to the keeping of animals, including the establishment of animal welfare committees, animal care plans, veterinary care programs and mandated record-keeping and disclosure, as well as regulating human activity around the care of the animal—not just what physically touches the animal.", "The legislation would also amend the Animals for Research Act, which would allow the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or the OSCPA, greater oversight over the condition of large marine mammals that are used in research. This includes providing inspectors the power to look at enclosures that the animal is not currently in but enclosures that the animal might be transported to or housed in regularly to ensure that anywhere an animal might spend time is up to the standard.", "The amended act would also provide for the setting of regulations around the keeping of, care and use of other marine mammals such as walruses and dolphins. Regulations surrounding enclosure sizes, limits to sound exposure to animals etc. would all be strengthened.", "As I mentioned before, I am not an expert. I might at one point have been a budding biologist—it feels like in another life—but the closest that I have been to a real whale was actually in Gaspé on a boat as a child.

As we all know, this government doesn’t exactly move too quickly with things—oh, wait, unless it’s the sell-off of Hydro One in the budget. But anyway, it wasn’t until 2013 that a panel was commissioned on the care and maintenance of marine mammals. The report of the expert panel was finally received the year following, in June 2014, and they reaffirmed the position of animal rights activists across the province that the current standards were, indeed, insufficient.", "The report that the expert panel tabled, known as Developing Standards of Care for Marine Mammals in Captivity and Recommendations Regarding How Best to Ensure the Most Humane Treatment of Captive Cetaceans—or, for short, the UBC report—outlined expensive recommendations. There are 124 pages in total for the government to adopt. As additional background, a cetacean is “a mammal (such as a whale, dolphin, or porpoise) that lives in the ocean.” They are complex creatures with complex social interactions.", "But back to the report: Some of the recommendations included requiring facilities that hold marine mammals to meet their physical and psychological environmental needs, requiring that facilities ensure that marine mammals are not harmed in their contact with the general public, and requiring that facilities must demonstrate commitment to the long-term care and well-being of marine mammals.", "Speaker, to provide an overview of the issues that the expert panel was evaluating, I will read from the summary of the report: “There are several aspects specific to the aquarium environment that can potentially cause stress in captive cetaceans, although none are unique to this group, and most can be mitigated through proper husbandry and habitat design. The most critical issues identified are the need for adequate pool space and design, appropriate social groups, and environmental enrichment. Additional concerns relate to suitable light and sound exposure in the habitat.", "“The relative survival rates of captive cetaceans in comparison to their wild counterparts seem to vary by species. However, there is an overall trend for wild-caught individuals to suffer higher rates of mortality during the capture process and upon the initial acclimation period in the facility....", "“Studies have demonstrated that cetaceans show physiological responses to stress that are typical of other mammals, although the nature of the stress response varies considerably by species. Studies show that transport, arrival at a new facility, and the introduction of new ‘pool mates’ can cause acute stress in several species. Unfortunately, obtaining samples to monitor the health status of individual captive cetaceans can also lead to stress responses, although adequate training can reduce these negative effects. Behavioural observations can be used as an alternate, inexpensive means to assess some aspects of animal well-being.”", "These are fairly straightforward asks—common sense, one might even say. And regardless of the technical nature of the issue, we can all understand the need for increased regulations surrounding enclosures, interactions, etc. So we are pleased that these broad concepts are reflected in this bill, disappointed that it has taken so long to get here, and hope that the government will continue to consult more broadly to more effectively protect all animals in our province.", "As I mentioned earlier, the biggest challenge when it comes to housing whales or dolphins is the challenge of trying to replicate their natural environment.

He said:", "“I find the approach to the development of this bill to be rushed and improperly researched. The development of standards and guidelines for animals in captivity is a very complex one, with a need for specific criteria developed for a very unique Canadian set of challenges. The other nine provinces have addressed the issue of exotic animals in captivity and many are currently looking to enhance their legislation in this area and are waiting for the New Brunswick task force recommendations to be released prior to moving forward. Ontario is the only province that has done nothing provincially in this area, leaving this issue to the municipalities to address. Currently there are 70 zoos in Ontario, with only 11 of these facilities having achieved accreditation.”", "He continues: “I applaud the province for taking the initiative to develop standards for animal care; however, if the province is determined to go through with the guidelines and standards and a ban on orcas (and I believe that they will) then why not use a very thorough set of modern standards developed over the last 10 years here in Canada by the CCAC, not a set of standards developed 30 years ago by the United Kingdom that nobody in the world uses because they are unobtainable.”", "I will continue with Mr. Bruce Dougan’s words: “As I mentioned to you, I have chaired a task force here in New Brunswick that is mandated to identify gaps and weaknesses in the current legislation, regulations and policies that led to the tragic deaths of two boys in 2013. There was very adequate legislation already in place, but our task took some nine months, comprised of weekly 78-hour meetings to reach a consensus on the recommendations, and this report has not yet been finalized and submitted. That is to say that the issue of a made-in-Ontario set of standards and guidelines will require the proper expertise, time and attention that it desperately deserves, and should not be fast-tracked.”", "I would also like to share part of their submission to the committee and their thoughts on the development of these standards:", "“As you may know, CAZA has long advocated that the government of Ontario address the policy, legislative and regulatory gaps that exist with respect to animals in human care.", "“This is why, when Minister Naqvi indicated last January that the government would be introducing enhanced standards of care for marine mammals, we applauded his announcement.", "“At the time, we expected to see unfold a process grounded in science and verifiable best practices that would begin to fix Ontario’s broken system.", "“However, while we were grateful for the opportunity to participate in the development of these standards as a member of the technical advisory group, we had concerns from the outset with the timelines and scope of the exercise.", "“Absent evidence of a current or imminent marine mammal welfare crisis in this province, we found the time frame as inexplicable as it was unfortunate....", "“In summary, we applaud the government’s intentions, but believe that the approach chosen is flawed.", "“We urge this committee to recommend a pause, and for the sake of the animals, that this important exercise be placed on solid scientific footing.”", "Mr. Speaker, the CCAC standards are standards that are developed in Canada and held to be exemplary. The issue, as I understood it, as I gleaned from hearings, is that the CCAC standards did not define optimal pool size or dimensions. The government bill, however, sets out pool specifics and has based them on these 30-year-old UK standards.", "I’m going to put this as clearly as I can, because it took me a while to understand this in committee, with so many different experts weighing in on this. These UK standards are 30 years old, but really, the concern is not about how old they are. The concern seems to stem from the massive, nearly impossible to construct size and dimensions of this recommended pool. The UK standards have actually never been used anywhere, arguably because the cost and challenges of building to these standards would either be impossible or they would be financially nearly impossible.", "Some voices at committee want the government to use these standards because they are the biggest, and then some said that it would be the ideal or the best. Others argued that it isn’t about the depth or diameter of the pool, but rather the design and complexity—for example, if a pool had areas for an animal to rub against. Others hoped that the standards would knock businesses out of the water, so to speak. Others asked for more reasonable standards that aren’t going to mean an end to their business viability. Quite frankly, it was a very deep issue, and people did not agree.", "It was clear, however, that the government arbitrarily picked these standards because they thought they were the best, or it was the only standard that existed that had an actual number on the dimensions of the pool. They need to consult with those who would know whether or not bigger is better, or the biggest is the best. That seems to be what would be fair, and that also seems to be what would be proactive, not just reactive.", "I will share with you from a letter submitted by Dr. David Rosen of the Marine Mammal Research Unit at the University of British Columbia. Dr. Rosen co-authored the report Developing Standards of Care for Marine Mammals in Captivity and Recommendations Regarding How Best to Ensure the Most Humane Treatment of Captive Cetaceans. This report recommended the adoption of the Canadian Council on Animal Care, or CCAC, guidelines as a specific standard of care for marine mammals. His thoughts on the arbitrary adoption of the specific UK standards are as follows—actually, he had mentioned in the CCAC report the reason they didn’t have specific standards on pool depth: “First, such a specific recommendation was outside of the scope of the report. Second, insufficient scientific information exists on which to base any quantitative evaluation.”", "He goes on the say, “Unfortunately, in the 30 years since the report by Klinowska and Brown”—also known as the UK report—“insufficient research has been undertaken to make such decisions on a scientific basis. This does not mean, however, that such an approach is not possible. It is my opinion that what is required is a set of standards of care based upon verifiable best practices, informed by quantitative data produced and analyzed in a scientific manner. Fortunately, such a ‘natural experiment’ already exists within the variety of facilities and marine mammal species currently held in aquariums within North America. This would provide the basis of a study of existing pool sizes and physical parameters measured against impartial criteria of animal health and well-being. Such an objective approach, initiated and supported by the government of Ontario, would place the province in the forefront of animal welfare practices and serve as a model for other jurisdictions.”", "In addition to some of the concerns that I’ve mentioned, there are other ways that this bill comes up short. I’ve already touched on the fact that this bill took a matter of years to come to fruition, but in its current form, there are still areas for improvement, primarily in terms of enforcement.", "Currently, Bill 80 would only allow the OSPCA to apply to the courts to remove a marine mammal in contravention of the act if a facility fails to do so themselves, rather than having the ability to enforce the act directly. Subsequently, this would permit the continued or potential mistreatment of animals, as any sort of lengthy court application process, wait time or extended case could immensely draw the process out.", "As well, I noted earlier that the bill permits a six-month period when prohibited animals can be brought into the province temporarily before being removed, which the government, hopefully, can elaborate on.", "As always, the legislation remains vague in areas about how the OSPCA’s powers will be extended. Unfortunately, that wasn’t sufficiently clarified during the committee stage.", "Speaker, I will finish up by thanking the minister for the opportunity to speak on this bill. Like I said, I didn’t expect this to be the first bill that I would speak to in my new critic role for community safety and correctional services, but it is an important topic, and I have appreciated the chance to learn and to share my thoughts. The priority of this bill must first and foremost be increasing protections and standards for marine mammals in our province, and though it is imperfect, I believe that this goal is reflected in Bill 80.", "This is about setting minimum standards. The closer these minimums are to best practices, the better, but we do need to guarantee a minimum standard of care for all animals in captivity. We hope this bill will do that, but we do hope that the best practices, after consultation with the experts, actually are the best. Currently, too many things are left up to inspector discretion on what is adequate or appropriate, so minimums must be quantifiable and enforceable if the intent of this bill is going to be realized.", "I appreciate that some—some—of the relevant experts and stakeholders have been consulted and included through the process, but we hope that this government will continue to regularly and thoroughly consult on issues of animal welfare with them.", "Ultimately, New Democrats support the intentions of this legislation, and I am pleased to support Bill 80, the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act." ],

The killer whale is now in her late thirties, and the Toronto Star has raised numerous concerns about her health and whether she’s getting good care. I want to make a point that Marineland disputes these allegations.", "It’s an example of the government introducing legislation to address a media story rather than introducing legislation to provide good government. We believe that animals should get good care. We believe that they should be protected, but we also believe that the government should have done more with this bill.", "This bill prohibits orcas, or killer whales, from being bred or brought into Ontario. It makes it sound like this is a growing problem but, in fact, last year there were no orcas brought into Ontario or bred here. The bill also prohibits orcas from being held at research facilities in Ontario, but again, there are currently no orcas in research facilities. In fact, animal activists are upset because if this bill passes, it will result in Kiska being alone for the rest of her life. Even Bob Barker, the former host of The Price is Right, contacted the Premier to ask that Kiska not be forced to spend the rest of her life alone. It’s an example of what happens when the government introduces legislation to respond to a media story rather than trying to make good policy.", "This bill is a missed opportunity. If the government is prepared to make amendments to the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, then let’s help more than one animal. Let’s make a change to the legislation so it does a better job of protecting all animals. As it stands, the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act isn’t working for farm animals or farmers.", "In a letter to the minister three years ago, the Christian Farmers Federation of Ontario said, “The CCFO firmly believes that animals deserve to be treated with kindness and respect during the entire production cycle and is adamant that animal neglect or cruelty has no place in Ontario’s livestock production. However, the current approach towards inspection and enforcement has led to an unacceptable situation, with widespread distrust and fear among producers which must not be allowed to continue and requires a new approach.”", "That letter was more than three years ago. It asked the minister to consult with Ontario’s livestock sector and other interested parties and develop policies that work. Three years later, we haven’t resolved the problems for Ontario’s livestock, but we have a bill for one killer whale.", "Too often, we hear stories of inspectors who don’t have sufficient training going onto farms. They aren’t large animal vets and they don’t understand farm protocol. We wouldn’t send a vet used to dealing with cats and dogs to deal with killer whales; neither should we send someone without the right training to deal with farm animals.", "Several years ago, a Chesterfield dairy farmer, David Robinson, was charged with 12 counts of animal cruelty by the OSPCA for having malnourished Holstein cows. However, from reports, it sounds like the issue was more that the inspector didn’t have sufficient knowledge of farm animals and older cows. Two local veterinarians said the animals were not underfed. In fact, one of them said that the OSPCA order to increase the body fat score to 2.5 in a 17-year-old cow was like asking an 80-year-old man to look 25.", "There are instances where there are real problems. We unfortunately had one of those incidents in Oxford a few years ago, when a farmer was no longer able to care for his cows. They had been neglected and had to be removed. In those situations, we need people with proper training. We need people who can both recognize the problem and who know what action is needed to correct it.", "If this bill were to ensure that we had more people like that, it could make a significant contribution to animal welfare.", "Another issue the government should have addressed in this bill is biosecurity. Biosecurity on our farms is hugely important, especially when we are dealing with diseases such as PED and avian influenza. When we’re trying to stop the spread of a disease from one farm to another, it isn’t acceptable for an OSPCA inspector to go from one farm to another without taking biosecurity measures such as washing their truck. If an inspector doesn’t have farm training, when a farmer asks them not to enter the property after being at a neighbour’s, it sounds like they’re being difficult. But the reality is that the farmer is likely just trying to protect the animals against disease.", "This bill would have been a good opportunity to ensure the standards for proper training for OSPCA inspectors dealing with farm animals. Instead it is a bill that addresses one investigative series of media articles and one killer whale.", "One of the issues related to biosecurity is that of requiring warrants. When the inspector needs to get permission to enter the property, there is an opportunity to talk about the need for things like a truck wash, foot wash or boot covers. There’s an opportunity for the farmers to explain their biosecurity protocol that the inspectors should be following.", "Too often the government introduces legislation that creates exemptions where warrants are not required. In fact, the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and the Ontario Immigration Act, which is also being debated by the Legislature, both provide this exemption. Warrants are necessary, not only to protect the rights of individuals, but also to protect against issues like biosecurity on our farms and to ensure that when there is a real problem, the case isn’t thrown out of court on a legal technicality. Too often we have seen the OSPCA take cases to court only to see them thrown out.", "This bill was an opportunity to make some real changes that would create a better system and better protection for animals and their owners. But it’s an opportunity that the government missed.", "One of the other challenges that this bill should have addressed is the fact that the OSPCA has to raise money to fund operations. I remember a few years ago when there was a charity walk in Toronto. Despite the fact that there were numerous trails in the city, the participants were sent on a route along busy streets. When one of the participants asked why, she was told, “Trees don’t donate.” Well, Mr. Speaker, we have a real concern that the OSPCA could operate in a similar way. Headlines and publicity encourage donations. This bill could have created more separation between the charity and enforcement, but instead we are focusing on one single whale.", "The killer whale is not the only animal facing health issues. If this government truly cared about animals, they would be doing a better job of investigating the causes of mortality in our bee population. The government has been focused on one potential cause without really investigating the impact of other problems. We know that the bee habitat is disappearing. We know that there are mites that could be causing bee mortality. What we don’t know is the impact of those factors on our bee population. If this government cared about animals, they would be looking into the causes of bee mortality to make sure that the action they take is going to solve the problem. Instead they are causing hardships for our grain farmers without knowing whether that is the solution and that it will protect bees.", "I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this bill, and I wish that the government had chosen to do more with it. I also wish we were focusing on bigger issues rather than spending all our time on a bill that only protects one whale: issues like the misuse and waste of social housing money at the Housing Services Corp. when we have a list of 168,000 families who need affordable housing. Each year, we have set a record for the number of families waiting for affordable housing, and yet the government continues to allow money to be wasted on items like trips to Europe.", "Mr. Speaker, I recently sent out a survey to every household in my riding as part of my newsletter. I didn’t receive one single response asking for this legislation. I didn’t receive one single response that said, “We need to do more to protect killer whales.”", "What I received were responses from people who were worried about a proposal to locate a landfill site on fractured bedrock near the Thames River. That landfill would impact a lot of marine life, so maybe it should have been addressed in this bill. As I’ve mentioned repeatedly, it would also put our drinking water at risk. One of Ingersoll’s wells is located only a short distance from the site, and that is not an acceptable risk.", "I also received responses from people who were worried about wind turbines and the impact that they would have on the health of their community. I received numerous responses from people who were concerned about the increasing cost of hydro and the cost of the proposed pension plan—but again, not a single response asking for this bill.", "I hope that, moving forward, the government will address more of these issues that are causing hardships and having a real impact on my constituents and the people across Ontario. I appreciate them introducing this bill, and we will be supporting this bill, but much more needs to be done to protect all animals in the province of Ontario." ],

I’ve heard some really good comments on the part of all members of the House who had something to say about this.", "I think, in the end, we understand that Marineland is a viable business. It provides a great service to the people of the Niagara region. It’s a place that we can bring our kids and where we can enjoy ourselves. Trying to deal with this entire issue in regard to how we deal with whales in captivity is, obviously, a sensitive one, depending on what side you’re on, and I’ll let people speak to that.", "I just want to take this opportunity to say, and I said this in the second reading debate, that one of the things that I think we really need to think about—and I know we could have done this in this bill and, unfortunately, we didn’t—is to take a look at tourism from a bit of a different perspective and to say that there are whales to be seen in Ontario that are not at Marineland. They actually live in the wild in Ontario. I know most members of the assembly now know this, because I’ve said it before, but, Mr. Speaker, there be whales in Timmins–James Bay and in Kenora–Rainy River. We have belugas up in Hudson Bay and James Bay. One of the sad things is that, as a province, we have never looked at how we are able to deal with tourism, and trying to do it in some way that is ecologically viable, to be able to see whales in their environment.", "Some of us have gone to British Columbia and Alaska, or have gone to the Maritimes and to the St. Lawrence, to see whales in the wild, in their own environment. It’s a majestic thing to see. I’m flabbergasted when I see whales in the wild, because it really makes you feel insignificant as a human being, being such a small person on this very big planet and sharing it with animals or mammals that are as big as they are. They’re quite something to see.", "I think one of the things that we could have done is said that there needs to be some sort of task force or committee or ministerial directive, or whatever you want to call it, that would say, “How are we able to develop other opportunities for tourism in Ontario where we have things like beluga whales that are natural to the province of Ontario?” so that we’re able to say that the times when belugas are active—and it’s a very short window. It’s not all the time; let’s recognize what this is. They tend to go by—well, I saw this here, and I’m going to come back to that in a minute. It’s a short period of time that belugas are able to be viewed, and there’s a fair amount of work that has to be done for you to be able to see that, because they are not exactly hanging out next to shore. They’re at the mouth of the river. You have to build some infrastructure so that people can actually be at the mouth of the river to be able to see these wonderful creatures in the wild.", "The other creatures we see are seals. There are seals at the same time, within the mouth of the river. Why are they there? It’s a natural cycle of feeding. There are all kinds of—how would you say it? The water rushing down into James Bay from the ground, coming back, is washing in all kinds of feed that the whales and seals are eating at that particular time of the year. That’s why they are there. At the same time, you’ve got polar bears.", "There’s certainly a way that I think you would be able to say, “Okay, let’s figure out ecologically how we’re able to put in place a mechanism by which people are able to see this with the proper type of infrastructure,” so that we can give young people in this province, and older people like myself, and new grandfathers like you—congratulations, by the way.", "I just want to take one second to say something that was said to me some years ago by Bruce Crozier, who was a member of this assembly a number of you would know. Our first grandson wasn’t born yet. We were still waiting for the delivery of our first grandchild; we didn’t know if it was going to be a boy or a girl. Julie, our eldest daughter, was three or four months to due date, and I remember Bruce coming to me, and I said, “Why are people making this big fuss about grandkids? I just don’t get this.” He looked me square in the eye and said, “Listen, Gilles, it will change your life. You just wait until your first one is born, and your life will be changed.” And I can tell you, it is a life-changing event. There’s nothing that makes mémère and pépère Bisson happier than one of the grandkids walking in the door, and if they don’t walk in the door, guess what? Mémère and pépère are going over there to knock on their door, because we want to be part of their lives.", "I congratulate you and your family because it is really the thing that completes the cycle of life. I know other members in this House are in the same, and it’s just quite something. I know you yourself—so you know what I’m talking about.", "So to Bruce Crozier, our dearly departed friend, I just want to say, man, was he right on that particular note.", "But back to whales: My point was, we should be looking at ways of being able to encourage ecotourism to see whales in the wild. For example, some of the infrastructure is there. Some of you have come to James Bay and you’ve had a chance to stay at the Eco Lodge. The last time that I had this talk, I said the number was 705-658-6400 if you want to call and book yourself at the Eco Lodge. It is a wonderful establishment built by the MoCreebec First Nation community, a non-status reserve where they have a number of commercial enterprises that they utilize to pay for infrastructure and run themselves as a traditional band. They do it in the sense of a traditional band. It’s not an Indian Act band; it’s actually a traditional band, which is quite something—amazing leadership there over the years, with people like Randy Kapashesit, who is since dearly departed from us—a visionary leader—and other people like Allan and others who are there.", "They have an Eco Lodge that they built, an eco-lodge where you can go and stay. You can make arrangements to get out on the bay to see the whales and the seals, and to go onto the land and experience what the Mushkegowuk Cree lived for centuries and for millennia on the James Bay coast. There’s not enough of that out there. Quite frankly, even organizations like the Eco Lodge need to have some support to develop that infrastructure and the marketing necessary to attract the tourists to come, because build it and they will come." ],

There will always be subsidy on trains. There’s not a train in the world that runs without subsidy. The government has admitted that the amount of money we have to invest into infrastructure to provide that infrastructure is quite expensive. Then, once you run it, you’ve got to subsidize it. GO Transit, TTC, Timmins Transit, none of that would run if they didn’t have some kind of subsidy.", "I think when we look at tourism, we need to actually look at the question of how we support ecotourism so that there are other ways for people to see animals in the wild or mammals in the wild, and in the case of Marineland, which I’ve been to as our kids were growing up and went through there—a wonderful facility where our kids got to get up close to animals they see on television but they never get to see in person. I’m sure most members of this assembly have gone through there with their own children or their grandchildren. It’s an amazing experience.", "The other experience we need to look at is how we promote ecotourism in different parts of the province that allows people to see what is natural, in the wild, in our parts of the province that we live in.

On a serious note, it is my pleasure to rise today and to speak once again to Bill 80, the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act, 2015.", "A lot has changed since the second reading of this bill, but in a way, absolutely nothing has changed. In committee, we introduced seven amendments that were designed in an effort to ensure that the contents of the bill matched the spirit of the bill. We wanted to ensure that the standards of care for marine mammals are based solely on science, not ideology. Understanding that future changes in regulations could have a direct negative impact on the economy of Niagara Falls as a whole, as well as other areas, we asked the government to note and mitigate adverse economic impacts where possible. Even the NDP voted against this amendment, and they represent Niagara Falls.", "A critical concern for us was amending the bill to require that OSPCA agents get proper certification to work on marine mammals, which are incredibly diverse and complex, and also to have a veterinarian present on inspections. Finally, we tried to provide a Kiska clause, where the minister would have the ability to allow a companion orca to live with Kiska, if the minister deemed it appropriate from an animal welfare perspective.", "Each and every amendment that we, the PC caucus—our team—brought forward was shot down by the Liberal and the NDP members of the committee, who had clear marching orders: “Vote down anything that’s a PC amendment.” I might add, too, that the government and the NDP did not bring forth any amendments at all. We were the only party to do so.", "Before I move forward with the rest of my remarks and get into some of the amendments specifically, I want to take us back in time, all the way back to 1986, and there’s a reason for this. Back when IBM released the first laptop, it weighed an astounding 12 pounds. It was nowhere near as powerful as the smartphones that fit in our pockets today. The Nintendo entertainment system in 1986 was released in North America, and if you recall, Speaker, cellphones had to be carried around in bags—great big bags, probably weighing anywhere between 12 and 16 pounds. They were huge; they were heavy; they were monstrous. This was modern technology back in 1986, ironically the same time period as when the UK standards of care that the government is using as a foundation for the new marine mammal care regulations—that’s when they were developed: back in 1986. As we can tell, technology has come a long way. But these standards haven’t.", "These standards are as old as Betamax and about as widely used. Numerous experts came forward through the short public consultation process and expressed their concerns. These scientists and industry experts called on the government to commit to basing their standards of care on the best and most up-to-date information available instead of the decades-old UK standards. Even Dr. Rosen, whose report was supposed to be the basis of this legislation and future regulations, called for the new Canadian Council on Animal Care, known as CCAC, standards to be adopted instead of the decades-old UK standards.", "The report stated, in no uncertain terms, “We recommend the timely adoption of the Guidelines On: The Care and Maintenance of Marine Mammals established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) as a specific standard of care for marine mammals under the OSPCA Act.”", "Sadly, Speaker, the government refused to make that commitment. And it could have had—and it can have, in fact—some grave consequences. Dr. Haulena is the chief head veterinarian at the Vancouver Aquarium. He’s also an adjunct professor of clinical sciences at North Carolina State University and an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia’s fisheries science centre. In his expert opinion, it is illogical to expect to be able to implement standards developed in the 1980s for bottlenose dolphins to other marine mammals, and this would be detrimental to the quality of care received by these animals.", "Dr. Haulena stated in committee, “Developing a standard for a bottlenose dolphin that now has to be, just with the mathematical model, expanded to a beluga whale or to a porpoise or to any other species is just impractical, unreasonable, unscientific and, from all we know, impossible.”", "The UK standards have not been adopted anywhere in the world because they are outdated impossible to implement. If the government adopts these obsolete standards, they will cause a substantial loss of economic activity in the Niagara region. The outcome would be the closure of Marineland as well as other aquatic facilities. If that is this government’s end goal, they should be up front about it and let the region know what the economic impact of these decisions will in fact be.", "Mr. Wayne Thomson, a councillor representing Niagara Falls Tourism, stated that the Marineland provides 700 jobs directly, but, more importantly, 36,000 related jobs—not only in Niagara Falls but in the entire region. It generates millions of dollars in economic activity each year and Marineland provides $4.5 million annually in regional advertising. Closing the facility would come with a tremendous loss to the people of Niagara Falls.", "Why would the NDP vote against our amendment, which would safeguard Niagara Falls and its region from the unintended consequences of this bill? Don’t they care about the region’s economy?", "Even more important than the financial cost of allowing this bill to go forward without amendments is the potential harm to animals if we fail to address massive problems of the OSPCA. Yesterday, I went on to the OSPCA’s website to see if there were any job postings for inspection agents. Well, guess what? I found a posting for an agent, so I looked at the requirements. I assumed that a relevant degree in biology, or zoology, or relevant professional experience must be required. I was shocked to learn of the actual requirements. This is a quote from what we found on the Internet, on the job posting: “The successful candidates will possess an OSSD or equivalent and post-secondary education in police foundations, law and security education, or animal enforcement.” So, Speaker, all you need to become an OSPCA inspector in Ontario is a high school diploma and a degree that is completely unrelated to animal biology, or science at all, for that matter.", "If you’re currently in grade 12 and you haven’t taken any science courses beyond the bare minimum required to graduate—hopefully you can still graduate this year, after the mess the Liberals have made of the education file—you may be qualified to apply as an OSPCA agent without taking any additional science courses in college. If, for example, you take police foundations right out of high school, you can become a qualified OSCPA agent even before you turn 19. That is absolutely shocking.", "It also raises some alarming issues regarding abuses of power, as well as concerns over animal well-being. This raises some alarming issues in regards to safeguarding animal welfare in Ontario. How can you honestly expect people without a proper background in marine mammal care to be able to properly assess the well-being of these incredibly diverse creatures?", "OSPCA officers, overall, are very passionate and hard-working. They do their best to protect animals in this province. But they simply cannot be asked to uphold standards across such a diverse range of animals without proper training or certification. The status quo means that agents are going to miss out on clear signs of distress that a finely trained eye would catch.", "That’s why we introduced an amendment that would require OSPCA agents to be certified before they inspect marine mammals. Our amendment read that “an agent or inspector of the society may enter and inspect a building or place where marine animals are kept only if he or she has been certified with respect to marine animals in a manner deemed appropriate by the minister responsible for the administration of this act.”", "This amendment would give the power to the minister and the ministry to determine appropriate certification standards for inspections and for inspectors. This was a realistic amendment. We did not ask for certification to inspect dogs, cats, horses, cows, birds or any other animals. We simply asked that agents conducting inspections on marine mammals be certified to do so. We felt that this was a reasonable amendment to move, that it was a very constructive amendment and one that simply made common sense.", "Common sense did not prevail, as again both the Liberals and the NDP felt it was unreasonable. They believe that inspectors should not be certified when inspecting some of the most unique animals on the planet. They feel that a black-and-white checklist is sufficient when it comes to detecting stress or health issues in animals that inspectors may have never seen before. This is a disservice not only to the OSPCA agents, who are expected to be jacks of all trades; this is a disservice to the animals that inhabit Ontario.", "Many animal rights advocates have watched debate and committee hearings of this bill closely, and I really hope they’re watching right now. If you’re watching this debate and you’re concerned about marine mammals in Ontario, you should ask the government why they don’t want people who are tasked with ensuring that standards of care are enforced are even certified to deal with marine mammals.", "Another serious concern that we have is the unnecessarily rushed manner in which the government has chosen to deal with this complex matter. Bill 80 was introduced just over two months ago, and it’s wrapping up debate on third reading with time allocation. It was before committee for only a couple of days, and stakeholder groups who will be providing input over the summer for the new standards of care for marine mammals are claiming that the government is limiting their time to study this issue.", "Bruce Dougan, who was the head of New Brunswick’s task force looking into exotic animal regulations, stated in committee that the government is unnecessarily rushing the advisory process compared to New Brunswick, which took the better part of a year to do research and hold consultations. Mr. Dougan said that “we have hoped to see the government opt for a rigorous review of options to enhance the level of care and well-being of marine mammals rather than a mad dash to an imaginary finish line.”", "Instead, we are seeing this Liberal government place a priority on scoring political points. This is a scientific issue, not a partisan issue. By placing unnecessary time constraints on the consultation process and voting against good-natured amendments designed to promote animal welfare, this government has jeopardized the well-being of animals that it is claiming to protect.", "Many times during clause-by-clause, I asked the government to “go slow to go fast.” But no, they wanted to rush right through it. They want to do what I call a Phi Slama Jama.", "As many bills are currently before the House, they want to get those bills through before we break for summer. Why? Because they can, without giving the proper consultation needed to do it right—a made-in-Ontario solution, as my colleague Mr. Hudak had indicated.", "Sadly, Bill 80 represents a missed opportunity to get it right. For that reason, I cannot and we will not be supporting this bill." ],

They are expecting us to take action on helping to strengthen our economy, to invest in modern infrastructure and to support our essential services.", "Firstly, Bill 9, An Act to amend the Environmental Protection Act to require the cessation of coal use to generate electricity at generation facilities, was introduced in July 2014. In the past, Ontario’s coal-fired power plants cost the people of Ontario an estimated $4.4 billion per year in health, environmental and financial impacts. Because of the leadership of this government, Ontario’s elimination of coal-fired electricity is the single largest greenhouse gas reduction initiative in North America. It is the equivalent of taking up to seven million cars off the road. It’s like taking seven million cars off the road. This act, if passed, would ensure the health and environmental benefits of prohibiting coal used for electricity generation in Ontario are now protected by legislation.", "Next is Bill 37, An Act respecting Invasive Species, which was first introduced in February 2014.

Yet, in reality, this government, when it comes to its legislative agenda, could barely get a bill passed in the fall. In fact, they didn’t want to have hearings at all across the province. They didn’t want to hear from opposition parties.

I remember the third party House leader, Mr. Bisson, and I having a conversation with the government House leader about having some of these bills travel throughout the province, having maybe people in northern Ontario—I know that my leader, Patrick Brown, values the opinions in the north. In fact, he went up to the north last week on break week with the member for Nipissing. He went to the Ring of Fire. He hadn’t been leader for more than two weeks, yet he decided that going up to the north and hearing northern voices, to be able to meet with people, to be able to listen to people, to be able to hear that northern perspective, was important.", "You read this substantive motion, which is what we have to call it procedurally—it doesn’t provide any substantive travelling of this province.

That’s all they care about.", "And do you know what, Speaker? Here’s how they’re going to engage Ontarians, to ask them what they feel about Bill 9—whether they support Bill 9, whether they want to come and give testimony at one of these few days of public hearings. Wow. This is really going to get out there to the public. They’re going to put a notice of public hearings on the Ontario parliamentary channel, the Legislative Assembly’s website and Canada NewsWire. I just want to say that that is all the government is willing to do.", "There are so many other opportunities that this government has to promote its hearings. I know I’ve been a vocal critic of the government. We have committee hearings that don’t get streamed live. We don’t make that investment to make sure that all of our committee rooms have live-streaming capabilities so that we could show these hearings. We didn’t used to archive anything when I first got elected; we archive a smidgen of information on our website. To me, that is the bare minimum. In fact, it’s laughable that we’re going to take a four-page motion and on the very first bill have just three opportunities.", "The other thing I take umbrage with—and I know there are many members who have been here much longer than I have—is this section that says, “Witnesses are scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis.” For new members who were just elected in last year’s election, there was a convention around this place where parties would choose, on a rotational basis, people who would come before committees. For whatever reason, this government House leader has it in his mind that it’s going to be on a first-come, first-served basis.", "I can tell you, Speaker, that when I get done my address, I’m going to give the government a freebie. At one point during my time—and it looks like my time will extend over to the next time this bill is called—I’m going to change that section. I’m going to propose an amendment for (a), (b), (c) and (d) to change that. I firmly believe that if we are going to put partnership ahead of partisanship, when we choose those groups and individuals who are going to appear before committee, we should do it on a rotational basis, so that the government can choose someone, the opposition can choose someone and the third party can choose someone. I think we’ve been able to do that. We just did it with the bill that was debated this afternoon. Bill 80 was debated this afternoon on another programming motion—no big surprise with this government; they’re the experts on programming, time allocation and closure.", "I think that their chief government whip, who’s very skilled with a computer and technology, should probably write a little column for some of the area papers. Maybe we can post it on the Ontario parliamentary channel, the Legislative Assembly’s website and Canada NewsWire. That’s just a suggestion, Speaker, through you to the chief government whip, that maybe he could start working on that. We could put that up and let all the Legislatures of Canada know the skill that this government has in providing time allocation of substantive motions and issues of closure. Maybe we could call it—" ],

So in a committee that meets for four, five or six hours, if you start chewing up 14 minutes per person, you’re only going to have a handful of people. I think there were some bills that this government has put forward for their time allocation where they’ve had maybe six, seven or eight people who have even been allowed to make presentations, because, again, they don’t provide the days required to be able to debate these bills.", "A five-minute presentation and nine minutes between the parties for questions and comments, quite frankly—and I’m being kind to the government—is an absolute joke.", "You’ve got one day where basically you’re going to get less than a dozen people who are going to be presenting.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had a meeting with a farm or a farm group where I’ve talked about bobolinks or I’ve talked about Blanding’s turtles. Heck, I have Highway 15 in my riding. Part of the reason why it was delayed by the Ministry of Transportation was because of the grey rat snake and the Blanding’s turtle. The ministries couldn’t even talk between each other. They couldn’t talk between the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Natural Resources. I had to try to broker a meeting just to try to get these two groups together so that we could get construction of the road. That’s just one example in my riding. I’ve got many more, and I’m sure my colleagues, if given the opportunity, could flood the floor of the Legislature with issues in their ridings and concerns about invasive species.", "Regardless of whether this bill is good or not or has all-party support, to be able to say that you’re going to stay here at Queen’s Park for two days of public hearings and two days for clause-by-clause—again, they’re carbon copies of each other.

We must continue to attract skilled workers in order to address this long-term economic challenge. We must also do better at recognizing the credentials of immigrants coming to Ontario. When immigrants are unable to use their skills and have not had their home country education recognized, their contributions to the Ontario economy cannot be fully appreciated. Legislation that is informed not only by our own economic and labour market needs, but by the needs of those who will aid us in achieving our goals—those who are not just looking to Canada and Ontario for employment opportunities but for a future for their own families while becoming a member of ours.", "One of the more important provisions in this bill is that it confers new powers to the minister to conduct research, organize educational and training programs and appoint committees on immigration-related issues. This is a step in the right direction for Ontario. We need to do our homework to get the facts right. That requires education and research.", "I am also eager to see that this bill established a registry for both employers and recruiters who are interested in participating in an Ontario selection program under the OIA. This provision does fall short on requiring employment agencies and recruiters to register. I did introduce a motion in committee to have replaced the current definition in the act of “recruiter” to include the definition of “immigration consultant,” but unfortunately, the motion was defeated.", "New Democrats wanted to make sure that if and when—when, Speaker—a registry of recruiters and employers utilizing nominee and other foreign worker programs is established in the province of Ontario, if you hang a shingle out as a recruiter or consultant or employer and you offer these services, your participation in this registry becomes mandatory.", "New Democrats remain concerned that workers in this province, whether born here or just arrived, enjoy protections and rights—not only the universal rights and protections we all should expect but, where appropriate, protections specific to the circumstances in which they work. That’s a piece—a big piece—of the need for immigration legislation in Ontario, and now the Ontario Immigration Act. So we’d like to acknowledge that the government members of the committee did the right thing in passing this amendment.", "The creation of the registry is a good idea, and I believe that its membership should be mandatory for any person or business claiming to be an immigration consultant. We also put forward another amendment that would allow the minister to publish the names of foreign entities that participate in the registry if they are found to be in violation of requirements of the registry. That’s because there are big recruitment entities that are multijurisdictional. These are simple accountability measures which we feel strengthen the act.", "New Democrats heard from constituents on what’s good, what’s not so good, what’s missing and what could stand to be improved. We heard again from groups in committee, and we sought changes through amendments to the bill to ensure that there were at least some teeth in the act. If you represent yourself as a recruiter or immigration consultant—or employ temporary foreign or migrant workers—and you’re active in Ontario and you take advantage of those workers and their families looking for opportunities here, then you should be prosecuted and prevented from operating again in Ontario.", "Let’s ensure that this registry becomes a reality. Right now, that’s not clear. We must strive to protect the immigration process by creating a clear path to immigration that is accountable.", "There are some good opportunities for settlement service organizations who have been offering direction and aid to those who come here for a better life, with information and language services. There are provisions in the act that give me hope that the ministry will provide much-needed funds to these groups for the work that they are doing now.", "But increasingly, the skilled workers who come to Ontario need to be seeking out opportunities in Ontario, and many of them are heading to western provinces and out east. By giving them some certainty, by developing, as I’ve called it, a made-in-Ontario immigration system, Ontario can continue to benefit from the rich contributions of immigrants and immigrant communities to the province for generations to come.", "Thank you, Speaker, for the opportunity to speak to this bill.

My mother’s family came from England and Ireland. She was born here as well, out on the Prairies. Their stories of immigration really formed me, and I think our parents’ stories of immigration really formed them.", "My father—very classic. I was listening to the other member talk about his Italian heritage. My father’s family owned a fruit and vegetable stand on the Danforth. You can’t get more Italian than that. They said that during the Great Depression—I never knew my grandparents on that side—at least they ate. I remember growing up with that story. Other people weren’t so lucky. Because they had a fruit and vegetable stand on the Danforth, they actually had food, so they were some of the lucky ones.", "On the British side, who grew up on the Prairies and homesteaded out there, my grandfather was the only doctor in miles and miles and miles, and my grandmother, with four little children at home, would go days and days without seeing him. She would tell stories of seeing him coming home on the horizon, a day before he got there—that’s how flat the land was, looking out—and of how she would be stuck at home with these four little kids and without a whole lot of support: coming from Great Britain, where she was one of 12, a very Victorian family—coming from this huge family, to being stuck on your own, with little children in the middle of nowhere, with your husband always somewhere else.", "Those are the kinds of stories that really form our character and form our being. In fact, that is in part, I think, why we are all here: because we are the products of that and we’re proud of that. We do ourselves a disservice to not remember the hardships as well as the good times.", "I also grew up on stories of my father, as an Italian immigrant, being told—he was a semi-pro boxer—that he could walk in the back of a certain club—I won’t name the name—but he couldn’t walk in the front door, when he fought for them, because he was Italian. That was part of our heritage as well.", "He told me of the boardwalk in those days. He remembers a sign that said “No Jews or dogs allowed” on the boardwalk in Toronto, in the Beach. He remembers the Christie Pits race riots, where neo-Nazis came and fought. This is all from the 1930s. This is all part of our heritage.", "I kind of long to read, Mr. Speaker, that real history of the peoples of Ontario—the bad, the good, the sad, the glad. Sometimes those moments have really formed us too. Certainly, on this side of the House, in the New Democratic Party, our strong sense of necessity for social justice comes from our parents too, and from their hardship, from what it was like for them to grow up in a society that wasn’t as accepting, that wasn’t as multicultural, that wasn’t as inclusive. That was the reality.", "I remember, as a little kid, growing up in an English-speaking household for the most part, and going to Huron Street public school in downtown Toronto, which was by far—again, it wasn’t a chi-chi area. It wasn’t expensive back in those days. It was rooming houses. My parents ran a rooming house. Those big, gorgeous Victorians on Bedford Road were rooming houses; they were student housing back in the day.", "Walking to Huron Street public school—it was a multicultural extravaganza by Toronto standards back then, but we only had one kid of colour in the entire school. There weren’t many kids of colour back then. I didn’t even know that she was a kid of colour. I mean, this is children, Mr. Speaker. It’s really wonderful to look back on my experience and think I didn’t have consciousness of difference in that way. I remember skipping with her in the schoolyard, and a photographer caught our picture, myself and her skipping together, and that became the poster. We became the poster children for Christians and Jews, the society of Christians and Jews, who were promoting multiculturalism, and we got to have lunch with the then mayor, Nathan Phillips. We were the multicultural poster children—me, a white kid, and her, a kid of colour—and there we were. We didn’t even know why they would take our picture. That kind of innocence and naïveté was quite beautiful.", "I also remember being invited back to the house of one of my school friends after school, and his mother—I think I was seven or eight at the time—offering me a little shot of wine—very Italian, much more Italian than my family. I thought, “This is bizarre.” For a white British kid to be offered a shot of wine at the age of seven or eight was quite something in those days.", "Again, these early multicultural experiences, which, when you look back on them, they’re sweet, they’re innocent, they’re not so sweet, they’re not so innocent.

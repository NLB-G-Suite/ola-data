We have 12 million people coming to Niagara Falls.” They start coming really in May until September, maybe October, and then it kind of spreads out over the winter months even though they still come. He said, “What are we going to do? Do we have to pass on the cost of hydro to people coming to visit Niagara Falls?” What are you thinking here? So now what do you do?

This government is trying to make it look as if there’s nobody in the history of the province of Ontario who has ever invested in infrastructure. They’re trying to make an argument that by selling Hydro One for $9 billion and keeping $4 billion to build transit, they’re going to do something that Ontarians had never done before, and that is to make important investments in transit. Well, I’ve just got to say, my God, the furthest thing from the truth is what the Liberals are putting forward, because governments in this House over the last 100 years have been investing in all kinds of infrastructure, everything from highways—" ],
  "anchor" : "para79"

Did we not build highways in this province? Did we not invest in subways in this province? Did we not buy transit cars in this province? Did we not buy buses in this province? We have been investing in infrastructure for years in this province.", "I would argue, is it enough? Probably not. But we have been investing in this province for years, and we’ve built up a system of transit and a system of roads that, quite frankly, is not a bad one. Could it be better? Absolutely, nobody argues that it can’t be better. You can always improve on what you’ve got. But they’re trying to create this narrative that you absolutely have to sell Hydro One or else the world is going to come to an end because we’re not going to be able to build any more transit.", "Well, I’d just say, first of all, what have governments done in the past to pay for things like subways? I was a member of the NDP government that was building two subway lines in the city of Toronto, the crosstown Eglinton line and the line that’s north by Steeles. We did that not by selling Hydro; we did that not by selling the public assets of Ontario; we did that by doing what everybody else does in the world, and that is to borrow the money over time and to pay it back. You pay it back by the increased ridership that you get from those particular lines, and you get it back from the taxes we all pay across this province.", "So this argument that the only way that you can build transit in the city of Toronto is for us to sell one of our crown jewels and to sell the assets of Hydro One to the tune of 60% is a preposterous argument. Every government in the world that invests in transit, roads, inner-city rail, airports and others does so by either having the money up front, if they’re lucky enough to have that money, or they borrow to do it.", "What do you think towns and municipalities across Ontario have done when it comes to building arenas in their communities, when it comes to building facilities of any type in their cities or building roads? They take out a debenture; that is, to borrow money. That’s how this is done.", "This government argues that the only way they can build transit in the city of Toronto is by selling Hydro. It’s a silly argument. In fact, if they sell Hydro, we’re going to lose about $700 million a year in revenue that we currently get from Hydro, because they pay money back to the province from the business they do in the province of Ontario. We’re going to lose a big chunk of that, which means we’re going to lose over time much more money than the $4 billion they’re going to get to put into transit. It’s a really, really dumb argument.", "I’ve just got to say to the government across the way that if somebody had come to me and said, “You know what? The government is going to sell Hydro,” and they told me that a year ago, I would have said, “The Liberals aren’t stupid enough to do that. There isn’t a government in Ontario that would be stupid enough to sell Hydro.” Why would you sell something that, quite frankly, is an important economic development tool in this province, as it used to be when electricity was being sold at cost before we did the privatization on the generation side? The political capital that they would have to pay as a result of selling Hydro would be enough for them to stop.", "I remember; I was here when Mike Harris mused about privatizing Hydro and Ernie Eves then did some actions when he became the Premier of Ontario. They didn’t just back down because CUPE brought them to court. Yes, that was a big part of it, but they backed down because the people of this province said, “Are you nuts? You’re going to privatize what? I don’t want you to privatize Hydro One, because I understand that if a business owns Hydro One, they’re going to want to make a profit, and that profit will come by way of higher rates.”", "So the government of Ontario of the day said, “No, we’re backing off the selling of Hydro.” Even the Conservatives understood that, and if anybody was going to sell Hydro One, it should have been the Conservatives. At least we understand—I don’t agree with them—but they’re the party of doing everything private sector, business kind of stuff, and they would see this as a way of being able to give the private sector yet more business opportunity. I would have understood the Conservatives doing it. I wouldn’t have liked it; I would have opposed it; I would have spoken against it; and I would have fought it, as we did back in the 1990s when Mr. Eves was trying to do that. But in fact, it’s the Liberals that are doing it. I’m saying, “My God, what is going on?”", "I remember the speeches of members on the government side, like the honourable Mr. Bradley. The honourable Mr. Dalton McGuinty was here at the time and others—I don’t know the ridings, I’m sorry, Speaker.

MTO had snowplows, sand trucks and others, and then they would augment that by hiring contractors if they needed that extra help cleaning our highways. It was a good system because Ontario didn’t have to keep all of the snowplows and trucks that it doesn’t always use on the fleet. They had a very big fleet of sand trucks, plows and others, but they would augment using the private sector. The difference was that MTO was the one that decided when the snowplow would go out and when the plowing was to take place.", "My point is this: The Tories started privatizing by getting rid of all of the government’s snowplows. They got rid of all the snowplows. The Liberals stood in opposition to that. I remember because I had Mr. Bartolucci running around the province with me condemning the Conservatives for the privatization and the sell-off of MTO equipment when it came to winter road maintenance. We predicted together, “My God, this is going to be a real problem when it comes to highway safety in Ontario.”", "The Liberals get elected, and what do they do? They didn’t just continue the privatization of the plows; they privatized the whole damn thing. They got rid of the engineers; they got rid of the inspectors; they got rid of the patrols. The whole darn thing was given over to the private sector.", "Now, during that time, we were out there, my good friend John Vanthof and I and others, saying, “Look at what’s happening on our highways. We have highways shutting down; we’ve got accidents going on.” I’m getting phone calls from the police in the middle of winter saying, “I’ve got to close down Highway 11,” or, “I’ve got to close down Highway 101,” or Highway 144 or whatever it might be, “because of winter road conditions. This is something I’ve never had to do before.”", "We sounded the alarm. Give the former Minister of Transportation some credit. As a result of pressures that we put on him—mayors, myself and citizens who took the time to take pictures and videos of the condition of our roads and brought it to the minister—the minister bought some extra snowplows. We gave him full credit for that. We said, “Well, that is a step in the right direction.” There were some 50 new plows that were bought for northern Ontario and about 100 overall for the province. But we still have a problem. The problem is, we still have those third-generation contracts that are in place today.", "So the auditor comes out and says, “This thing is a disaster. It’s a question where highway safety has been put at risk as a result of the privatization of our highway winter road maintenance system.” And then the government stands in this House and says, “Trust us. We’re going to privatize hydro. It’s going to be great. It’s going to be better. We’re going to still have control.” Give me a break. We saw what happened with the OPG privatization. We saw what has happened with the winter road maintenance. It doesn’t work. It costs us more money, and in the end we have less control and the quality goes down.", "So what’s the upside for the province? Ms. Wynne, the Premier, stands in this House and says, “You know, we need to sell Hydro because the only way we could ever build infrastructure in this province is to sell off Ontario Hydro.” What a silly, silly argument from a very smart person, I’ve got to say.", "You want to build infrastructure and you want $4 billion extra—which is only about 3% of what we have to spend on transit, by the way. Well, there are ways of doing it. The first thing is what we’ve always done, which is to borrow. Borrow what you can afford. Don’t borrow more than you can, and pay for it over time.", "The government, in way of its HST inputs and changes to the HST, has given corporations $1.5 billion to $2 billion in gifts when it comes to this new HST policy that’s now being enacted. It means to say that we, the taxpayers of Ontario, will be taking our tax dollars of working-class people and we’re going to be transferring them over to the corporate sector to the tune of $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year so they can wine and dine people when they take them out on business meetings somewhere. Is that good for business? Is that good for the people? Is that a way of being able to responsibly spend the dollars of the people? You would expect Mr. Prentice to do that, and that’s exactly what Mr. Prentice was doing. This Liberal government is doing exactly what Conservative governments have done in Alberta and are doing in Ottawa.", "So the government says, “How do I find $4 billion to be able to invest in transit?” You’re talking about one $4-billion hit in one year. I’m telling you right now that New Democrats have shown you where you can make $1.5 billion each and every year to be able to offset the cost of transit: a moderate increase in corporate taxes. Our corporate taxes in this province are among the lowest in North America. I’m not arguing, as Jim Prentice would argue, as he did in the debates, that we have to raise corporate taxes to record numbers. No, no, no. Nobody here is arguing that. New Democrats understand you can’t raise corporate taxes and let them rip, because there is a reality that we do compete with other jurisdictions. But when you’re the lowest tax rate when it comes to corporations, how about we just raise them to the rate of Alabama? Why don’t we try that? You think that raising our corporate tax rate to the same level as Alabama’s is going to scare the heck out of the business community? I know they’re not going to like it. I know they’re going to rail about it. I know there’s going to be four or five business executives sitting down on Bay Street talking about how they won’t be able to donate to hospitals and how they have their own mortgages to pay and how brutally wounded they’re going to be if they have to share some of the responsibility for building transit in this province. I understand that. I understand they would take full ads, if we were the government in Ontario, and they would fight us for five years, as they did when we were in government, because those guys, some of them—I’m not saying all of them.

Montreal has a great subway system. Vancouver has a great LRT system. They built highways and roads. We did not build because we were spending at a two and a half times lesser rate of investment. That means that for 50 years, we actually doubled our population but we did not double our infrastructure. We barely, barely, barely kept up. We didn’t keep up with population growth. We have entire communities that don’t have the basic infrastructure that other Canadians and Americans have.", "The second piece of that is it’s all old. Stuff that was built in the 1950s, like those of us who were born in the 1950s, need new bits and new pieces, and a little bit of an uplift and a tuck here and there. So all of this stuff, because 80% of our infrastructure out there was built in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s—80% of it is all aging at the same time. My friend the Minister of Transportation, my friend the Minister of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure and the Premier would all tell you, and any member of this House will tell you, that we have an infrastructure crisis in this country; that we are the first government to stand up and address that problem, because almost all of the infrastructure in this province is underinvested in." ],

I can tell you that I’ve not had one single constituent in my riding, or in any of Windsor-Essex county, who have supported selling off Hydro. In fact, time and time again we’re hearing that they already can’t afford to pay their bills. So if we’re looking at selling off Hydro, the price of hydro is going to go up even more, and the people in my riding aren’t going to be able to use the roads. They’re probably not even going to be able to afford to get to work. They’re not going to be able to afford public transit, they’re not going to be able to afford a vehicle, so they won’t be able to afford the roads that they’re suggesting they’re selling off Hydro for.", "It’s clear that the people in my riding are saying that the government’s not listening to them.

I know the minister stands up all the time and says that we’re holding the line on education. It’s stable. But in their own budget, page 230 of the budget, “Summary of Expense Changes Since the 2014 Budget,” they brag about saving $248 million on education. They’re spending $248 million less. They’re bragging about it. Yet we have infrastructure in education. Renewal costs haven’t gone down. The cost of hydro: not going down, and it’s going to go up even more if they sell Hydro. Cost of transportation: not going down, and special education needs are going up. That’s money that could have gone back into the system to support the students and the families." ],

What we object to is the fact that this is like selling the car and you now can’t get to work, or looking at selling something that makes money, which is Hydro One, but you’re going to prevent that revenue from being generated. And it’s all because of the lack of proper, balanced funding.", "When you look at the accumulation of this almost $300-billion debt, it has accumulated exponentially under the Liberals.

The member indicated that this provision undermines the authority of the House because it anticipates a reorganization of Hydro One and the passage of Bill 91, thereby amounting to a breach of privilege and a contempt of the House. The House leader of the official opposition, Mr. Clark; and the government House leader, Mr. Naqvi, also spoke to the matter.", "Having reviewed various procedural authorities, our precedents and the oral and written submissions of all three members, I am now ready to rule.", "I will deal first with the threshold issue. The government House leader raised a concern about the time lag between giving the requisite notice of the question of privilege and the incident giving rise to the notice. He pointed to my April 21, 2015, ruling where, acting under standing order 21(d), I exercised my authority without hearing from any member because of the unacceptable time lag in giving notice to the Speaker.", "I do not have concerns about the timeliness of the notice here because, whereas the April 21 situation dealt with a single pre-planned incident which was complained about only four days later, this one deals with a series of interrelated pieces of information in an evolving public policy matter. This is not to give permission to members to delay raising a matter of privilege when they first perceive the possibility that one exists, but rather to accept that there may be circumstances when it could validly take some time on an evolving matter before any implications for parliamentary privilege are sensed. I therefore remind members that if a matter is serious enough to warrant a question of privilege, it should be raised in a timely way, in the manner outlined in standing order 21(c).", "Turning now to the substance of the member’s claim, I will deal first with the argument based on breach of privilege before turning to the argument based on contempt.", "With respect to the contention that there has been a breach of privilege, no member has identified which individual or collective privilege has been violated. For example, there is no indication that any member’s privilege of freedom of speech has been compromised by virtue of anything that has happened—or been said—inside or outside the House with respect to the developments mentioned in the notice and the submissions. In fact, members have been exercising that privilege, and they may continue to exercise it when they speak in the House about those developments. Therefore, I find that a prima facie case of privilege has not been established.", "With respect to the contention that there has been a contempt, the member for Timmins–James Bay referred to a January 22, 1997, ruling in which Speaker Stockwell found that a prima facie case of contempt had been established in circumstances where statements in government-sponsored advertising tended to “convey the impression that the passage of the requisite legislation was not necessary or was a foregone conclusion, or that the assembly and the Legislature had a pro forma, tangential, even inferior role in the legislative and law-making process, and in doing so, they appear to diminish the respect that is due to this House.” However, in a June 16, 1998, ruling, Speaker Stockwell approvingly cited a seminal 1989 ruling by Speaker Edighoffer indicating that “it is perfectly valid for the public service to proceed with plans based on a bill that is already in the system in order to be able to act swiftly, once that bill becomes law.” In a September 25, 2000, ruling, Speaker Carr reiterated this view and also indicated that it is “a legitimate and necessary activity” for a government to plan for changes.", "The takeaway from these and subsequent rulings is that, compared to a broad publicly directed advertising scenario that anticipates the passage of legislation, a targeted or internal planning scenario that prudently prepares for the enactment of legislation is less likely to raise a matter of contempt; such plans are part and parcel of the function of government. Although a Speaker could be convinced that a prima facie case of contempt has been established in either scenario, the prerequisite of establishing either a motive to, or the effect of, undermining the Legislature’s role in the latter scenario is considerably more unlikely, as both common sense and procedural precedent confirms.", "Let me now apply this to the case at hand. The member from Timmins–James Bay points to statements by the government to the effect that the tentative settlements between Hydro One and OPG and the union representing their employees provides for the distribution of shares to union members, a distribution that, according to the member, is contingent on the passage of Bill 91. The member indicates that the presence of the share provision in the settlements was premature, did not show sufficient respect for the role of the House and has pre-empted the legislative process on Bill 91.", "In comparing the current matter with that faced by Speaker Stockwell in 1997, the very important difference is that Speaker Stockwell had in his hands a publicly directed advertising piece, authored by the government of the day, which in his findings explicitly diminished the role of the Legislature and presumed that the outcome of its consideration of legislation was a foregone conclusion. In the present case, there is no similar concrete evidence of that nature. The material presented to me and relied upon by the member for Timmins–James Bay is not in that same vein. I simply have not been presented with any document or communication authored by the government that inarguably presents the arrangements complained about as a fait accompli.", "These arrangements described appear to be in the nature of normal planning the affected organizations would be expected to engage in. Presumably, if the legislation does not pass, these arrangements will not be implemented.", "For the foregoing reasons, I find that there is no prima facie case of contempt.", "In closing, I would like to thank the member for Timmins–James Bay, the House leader of the official opposition and the government House leader for their oral and written submissions on this matter." ],

  "text" : [ "On behalf of Andrea Horwath and the New Democrats, I’m proud to stand with Ontarians today in celebrating Children’s Mental Health Week. Children’s mental health has not been given its rightful priority in our health system. The ripple effects of this can be seen in our emergency rooms, our community clinics and, over the long term, in our courts and our justice system.", "The Children’s Mental Health Ontario report indicates that we are failing, and at this rate we are heading for a systemic crisis. This year alone, 6,000 kids are waiting more than one full year for service, and that could double to 12,000 by next year.", "The good news is that the stigma is on the decline, which means that services are on the rise. Without additional funding or proper streamlining of services, child and youth mental health centres won’t be able to provide the needed care.", "It doesn’t have to be this way. It is estimated that 70% of childhood mental health issues can be solved with early intervention and therapy. Our children and youth—our province’s most valuable assets—deserve better. Like good physical health, mental health is an essential part of being able to lead a happy life and to grow up happy, healthy, productive adults. This is something every parent wants for their child, and something every child in our country deserves.", "The community-based agencies that are the backbone of Ontario’s mental health system for children and youth also deserve the necessary supports to be able to deliver the critically needed services.", "On behalf of my NDP colleagues, I’d like to thank Children’s Mental Health Ontario for this year’s important report card. I’d also like to recognize the countless other agencies, front-line staff, dedicated professionals and volunteers across our province who continue to do excellent care with limited resources for our youth.", "I’d also like to recognize my colleague, MPP Teresa Fanshawe, who has tabled a bill that will go to second reading this afternoon. If passed, it will address the lack of uniformity in access to and delivery of services and treatments across Ontario. Bill 95 would streamline fragmented programs, regulate the sector and give the Ombudsman oversight authority to provide more accountability and transparency." ],

Of course, Asia is vast and varied, encompassing many diverse peoples, including those of Korean, Tibetan, Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese heritage.", "The history of the Asian—particularly Chinese—contribution to this country is a long, proud and sometimes sorrowful one, Speaker.", "As mentioned in my remarks on South Asian Heritage Month, Canadians of Asian heritage make up more than five million, or 16%, of the population. Nearly half of these are Chinese.", "I’ll take a minute to single out the contributions and storied history of Chinese migrants to this province. The impact that the Chinese community has had is unmistakable, especially in the greater Toronto area, with one of the world’s greatest and largest Chinatowns—the original one, at least in Ontario, in the Spadina corridor of the city. Now, of course, the Chinese community is prevalent throughout the GTA, in Markham and across the province. Tourists come from all around the world to spend time in this historic neighbourhood.", "Of the most spoken languages in Canada are the various Chinese dialects. That should tell us something about the impact this community has had.", "We should, however, recognize that the hard work of Chinese Canadians was first brought about by a painful chapter of relying on the labour of Chinese migrants to build the Canadian Pacific Railway. That really was such a huge part of connecting what we know as Canada today. It came at a terrible cost. Every Canadian since should acknowledge this past.", "Today, Chinese and other Asian Ontarians’ contributions to every aspect of our lives can be felt throughout the GTA and clear across the province, from business to the arts. We note that this government has recently taken steps to cement a further relationship to Asia through trade. New Democrats join with other parties in recognizing the vital Asian-Canadian contributions to this province." ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today for the second reading of my private member’s bill, the Improving Mental Health and Addictions Services in Ontario Act, 2015. For me, the introduction of this bill is very personal and dear to my heart.", "As many members here may know, there was a deadly fire that broke out in an apartment building in London, Ontario, last year. The needless tragedy revealed a serious gap in safe, affordable housing for our province’s homeless, addicted, disabled and mentally ill people. In this particular case, a 72-year-old man, David MacPherson, died of injuries from the blaze and another person was injured.", "What has been happening in London, Speaker, highlights the deficiencies in the mental health system. In another case, a young man spent five days in an emergency department, in the isolation room. His family told reporters that he was scraping his hands against the walls until his knuckles bled and was summarily discharged after only a week of treatment in the psychiatric ward. In another case, at the Victoria Hospital, six mentally ill patients were left for 20 hours and resorted to sleeping on the floor.", "London’s news outlets continue to report on the city’s shrinking psychiatric hospitals and beds: 138 beds were moved to Windsor, Kitchener, St. Thomas and Hamilton; 70 beds were cut with cash that was shifted to provide care in the community. These reductions left London hospitals with the capacity to treat only 156 patients.", "I know that London isn’t the only major city whose hospitals have been clogged with mental health patients due to chronic underfunding. It’s happening throughout this province, and the intention of this bill is to take the necessary steps toward addressing those problems.", "When I shared my concerns about what was happening in London with my colleague from Nickel Belt, the critic for the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, she too was concerned about what was happening and told me stories about things that happened in her community. She also brought to light the select committee that originated here in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. She talked about the report that the select committee had done—because the member from Nickel Belt sat on that committee. That report was named the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions in Ontario report for 2010.", "At that point, I read the report. It was surprising, the number of deputations that went into the making of that report. More than 300 individuals and organizations gave deputations, with more submitting written reports along the way. The final report represented more than 18 months of work by the members of all parties.", "I want to take a moment to thank everyone who contributed to this report. This definitely was not a partisan issue, Speaker. All parties had a hand in the work and a hand in the report-writing. It was a very well-written report, I must say. Congratulations to everyone who did all that work. It’s really humbling to read that report and to know the dedication that each member put into coming up with some very well-thought-out recommendations and solutions to some of the problems, barriers and access pieces we have in mental health.", "What they achieved together was a clear vision forward for mental health and addiction services in Ontario. It is my intention to see that effort compensated by driving the recommendations of the committee forward. More than that, it is time for Ontarians who are suffering from mental illness and addictions to access the treatments they need to heal.", "The prevalence and incidence of poor mental health is staggering. One in five Canadians will experience a mental health illness in their lifetime. The remaining four will have a friend, family member or colleague who will have experienced mental health illness. Mental illness affects thinking, mood or behaviour, and can be associated with distress and/or impairment of functioning, with symptoms that vary from mild to severe. Schizophrenia affects 1%; major depression impacts 8%; and anxiety disorder 12% of people.", "Who are those affected most by mental illness and addiction? Some 70% of mental health problems and illnesses have their onset during childhood or adolescence. Young people aged 15 to 24 are more likely to report mental illness and/or substance abuse disorders than any other age group. Women were one and a half times more likely to meet the criteria for mood or anxiety disorder than men. Canadians in the lowest income group were three to four times more likely than those in the highest income group to report fair to poor mental health.", "Yet the real problems with mental health illness and addictions can be found in access to services, or lack thereof. Public confidence and trust in the mental health system is vital, yet too many Ontarians are going without the supports they need. Only one third of those who need mental health services in Canada actually receive them, and 71% of family physicians ranked access to psychiatrists in Ontario fair to poor. While mental illnesses constitute more than 15% of the burden of disease in Canada, these illnesses receive only 5.5% of our health care dollars.", "Despite access to service, one of the greatest barriers to achieving good mental health is the stigma associated with it. We did talk about how the stigma is getting better; it’s being slowly eroded, and that’s a good thing. Only 50% of Canadians would tell friends or co-workers that they have a family member with mental illness, compared to 72% who would discuss a diagnosis of cancer—or 68%, diabetes—in the family. Quite simply, the numbers are not good.", "In tough economic climates, these are the services that often see funding cuts or freezes. I appeal to the members of the chamber that we simply cannot afford not to fund mental health services and addictions appropriately in this province. We have to make sure that funding is there and stable.", "There is an overwhelming financial cost to society and our economy for being short-sighted in this regard. In Canada, mental illness is the second leading cause of human disability and premature death. Every day, 500 Canadians are absent from work due to psychiatric problems. Mental health is the number one cause of disability in Canada, accounting for nearly 30% of disability claims and 70% of the total costs. Some $51 billion is the estimated cost of mental illness to Canadian society in terms of health care and lost productivity; $34 billion of that represents the cost of mental illness and addictions to Ontario’s economy. In many respects, passing this bill should be a done deal, so to speak, as I am seeking to implement the work that all parties in this House have already agreed to. It is even based upon a proven model of success: Cancer Care Ontario.", "The first recommendation of the report of the select committee is to bring all mental health and addiction services and programs under one umbrella organization. Currently, mental health and addiction services are spread across more than 12 ministries, and there is no coherent system for the delivery of all mental health and addiction services in the province. Community care is delivered by 440 children’s mental health agencies, 330 community mental health agencies, 150 substance abuse treatment agencies and approximately 50 problem-gaming centres. In other words, this lack of cohesion in the mental health system prevents us from gaining a clear picture of all mental health services in the province.", "We know this sector is underfunded and resources are scarce. Therefore, we must ensure that they are used to their full capacity for the benefit of all Ontarians. But most importantly, it’s difficult for people who need these services to easily access them. That’s what’s happening. It does become very difficult to try to find your way to access services when you don’t know where they are and who’s offering them. Having this bill with one umbrella organization will help coordinate and designate some of those services so that people are aware of them.", "This bill is entirely about helping all vulnerable Ontarians by ensuring they have access to programs and services, regardless of age or where they live in the province. That’s another thing under the umbrella recommendations; they talk about children and youth services also being under one ministry. We’ve heard that children and youth talk about transitioning from mental health services to adult services. It isn’t a smooth process.", "My offices reached out to a diverse group of stakeholders, and the feedback we received has been quite positive, for the most part. We believe that this bill is a good first step in the right direction. It represents a tremendous amount of collaboration within the mental health sector; however, we also know that there is much more work to be done.", "I want to take a moment to recognize the efforts of all those working and providing mental health and addiction services throughout Ontario, from the front-line workers who are seeing increased mental health cases with not enough training—as is the case with our police, correctional officers, personal support workers and nurses—to the organizations that are dedicated to providing the research and the expertise, for example, the Ontario Peer Development Initiative, Children’s Mental Health Ontario, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Schizophrenia Society of Ontario, Alzheimer Society and all the other employees who make a difference in the lives of those with mental health and addictions.", "Lastly, I want to speak to those Ontarians who are in need of mental health supports. The good news is, mental health issues can be managed and overcome. The sooner you get help, the quicker you can heal. I pledge to continue working towards making sure that the services you need are available to you, the people in Ontario—the services that people need in Ontario. I know that people in the Legislature are very dedicated and conscious of mental health services and addiction, and I know that we’re going to continue that work and to make things better.", "Having this bill come forward today is the right thing to do. It’s a good first step into getting the coordination of mental health services under one home, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. It’s extremely important. People have come to the committee when it was taking deputations and they were very passionate about what they needed. It’s incumbent upon us to listen to the voices of Ontarians and to help them along with this legislation." ],

Last year, we announced the Mental Health and Addictions Leadership Advisory Council, which brings together experts and patients from across Ontario who have lived through the experience. This council will serve as a central body to identify issues across and within the mental health and addictions system and will advise us on ways to resolve these issues.", "Personally, last winter I remember that I made a statement in this House with regard to the opening of the new Gerald Sheff and Shanitha Kachan Emergency Department at CAMH on College Street, not too far from where I live. CAMH has been doing fantastic work. We’ve been very supportive of CAMH, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, as you know.

I believe that’s the only emergency department that is available right now, because they’ve seen tremendous growth in demand—I believe it’s somewhere around 70% or 75%—between 2006 and 2014.", "The member is correct: One in five Ontarians will experience some degree of mental health illness in their lifetime.

I’m pretty proud of the government’s initiative in the last little while, not only in recognizing that this is a major challenge for Ontarians and the Ontario government, but also in coming up with innovative ways to deal with it. We know it’s a complex issue, and it requires complex solutions. I’m happy that different ministries are working together to find a solution to tackle this.", "I agree with the spirit of this bill.

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to rise to speak in support of the member from London–Fanshawe’s private member’s Bill 95. I have to give her full points, because she has done something that the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions was unable to do. As a member of that committee, we spent a good deal of time in the last part of our deliberations trying to figure out, after we’d done all this fabulous work, how we then ensure that the report doesn’t just get filed. By bringing forward Bill 95, you have essentially encapsulated the recommendations that we collectively—I really want to remind people of that, because all of us who were on that committee know very intimately how involved each of us was. It was a commitment of 18 months that we all made. I don’t actually recall anybody subbing out at any point. We were all there because we wanted to be there. We saw challenges in our community and wanted to make changes. And we all participated in the recommendations. They were all consensus-based.", "So, congratulations to you for putting it into a bill. The select committee was able to look at many, many different issues and ministries, but one thing we couldn’t do, short of the last recommendation, which I think essentially said that in two years the government has to pull back the report and review the recommendations—we couldn’t do. So I’m happy to support it.", "You know, I will acknowledge that the report hasn’t been filed. People have talked about it. It is much more out of the shadows, so to speak. Many more corporate initiatives are occurring. Many more government initiatives are happening that are truly making a difference in the lives and family members who are trying to support someone who has a mental illness or addiction.", "I will give a little credit where credit is due, but the number one recommendation we made, and spent a lot of time on, was bringing all of these services together, making sure that whether you live in London or Kenora or Orangeville or Ottawa, you are going to know very definitively what kind of services are provided.", "When you get a cancer diagnosis, it doesn’t matter if you’re 30 or three. The Ministry of Health steps up and provides the diagnosis and the treatment. That’s all we were saying with mental health. Mental health is an illness. It’s not divided by age. It doesn’t start or stop at 18 or 21. What we wanted to see with that recommendation was to put it together in the Ministry of Health: Mental health is a health issue, so acknowledge that fact.", "There was a lot of discussion because at the time, again, there were issues in the Ministry of Health. There were many things going on, and some concerns were raised about: Well, is the Ministry of Health already too big? Would mental health care and addictions issues once again be pushed to the side because it’s such a large ministry and there are so many things going on? At the end of the day, again, as a consensus, we decided that, no, it was more important to acknowledge that it is a health problem.", "Part of the stigma that you hear about, and the reason there is a stigma with mental health and addictions issues, is in fact because people think you can suck it up and move on: “Go for a walk, and you’ll get better.” You know what? Life is not like that, and mental health isn’t like that.", "For us to say in a very clear, legislative way, “Put it into health because it is a health care issue,” was a very conscious decision that we did. I think we deliberated on it for quite some time before we came to that conclusion.", "I just want to say: Well done for figuring out how to take this report and put it into a legislative process, so we can move on and actually continue to move the issue forward. One of the benefits of legislation is that you have the ability to pull it out and say, “Are you following it? Are you maintaining it? Is it happening?” We do that with legislation. We have that ability. If we had Bill 95 on the books, so to speak—even in committee—it would allow us to once again pull forward and say, “Absolutely.”", "There are some things that have happened in the last number of years that have been good news for people who have mental health issues or families who are supporting those individuals. But it also allows us to say, “Where can we do more? Where are the gaps in the system?” Without a doubt, there is no one in this chamber who can say that all the gaps have been filled. We still have stories of people waiting for assistance who are going far too far away from their home community and that peer support to look for services. We have an opportunity here to make that easier and accessible for all, and so I’m happy to support Bill 95 and wish you all the best." ],

I really want to congratulate the member for London–Fanshawe for bringing this bill forward. I am very proud to be her colleague, not just in the NDP caucus but as a representative of our community of London.", "This is an issue that is critically important for Londoners, and the member for London–Fanshawe knows this and is taking action on pushing this issue forward. It’s hard to imagine another community in this province that has been as directly affected by the crisis in mental health as London. Last year, we heard from the London police that there has been a 40% increase in calls over one year in dealing with mental illness, and this comes at a cost of $14 million, which is 15% of the police budget. What should be a health care issue is becoming a policing issue. This not only has significant financial implications but also enormous personal costs to the dignity and the health and well-being of the person who is experiencing a mental health crisis. Certainly, there’s no question that police need training to understand mental illness and to understand how to respond appropriately to someone who is in crisis, but it makes no sense to have police as front-line mental health workers.", "When the pre-budget hearings were held in London just a couple of months ago, in January, we learned that London Health Sciences Centre is running at 114% capacity every day for acute-care mental health patients. On any given day, you can walk into the ER and see up to 14 patients waiting for an in-patient bed. In December, over the holidays, we know that Victoria Hospital was at 125% capacity because of people facing mental health emergencies. As the member for London–Fanshawe mentioned, just last March, we learned of patients with mental illness who were forced to wait 20 hours or more at Victoria Hospital and ended up sleeping on the floor because of chronic overcrowding. So ER has become the default for mental health and addictions because people don’t know where else to go in the community for services.", "Those who are discharged often don’t get the supports they need, and that has resulted in the tragic death of a Londoner, David MacPherson, who was living in a substandard, unregulated rooming house. He died in a tragic fire, completely unsupported by any community agencies.", "That’s why this bill is so important. It will bring together in a single umbrella organization the hundreds of agencies that provide mental health services currently administered by 10 different ministries. It will bring some much-needed coordination and coherence to the system. Frankly, right now, we don’t have a system of mental health services in this province, and that is what Bill 95 will do. The recommendation to create this agency was the first recommendation of the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions, but from it flowed all of the other recommendations of the report.", "Before I close, I want to quickly mention the final recommendation. I met with a group of families—parents who support adult children with mental health issues—in my community of London, and what was critically important to them was the recommendation about the need for changes to the Personal Health Information Protection Act so that family members can be involved in treatment plans and discharge strategies for their loved ones. I’m just going to read what they said: “As the ones who continually have to pick up the pieces of our family members, we feel we have valuable information that should be integral in the treatment plan of our loved one. In the regular health care system, as opposed to the mental health system, caregivers have access to the patient’s health problems and their treatment plan, and are often asked to take a very active role in the patient’s recovery.”", "This legislation will address that gap. I congratulate, once again, the member for bringing this forward. Let’s all support it." ],

I saw all kinds of individuals, from every walk of life and from every age group, suffering from these things.", "The reason we talk about mental health and addictions together in the same sentence is because they are so connected. Those with mental health issues sometimes fall into an addiction type of pattern, which is a severe health risk for them; and those who become addicted then end up with mental health issues. It’s why we combine them in the same sentence.", "In my work as a nurse, knowing how many individuals suffer from these kinds of illnesses, over the years—it has only really recently become such an issue across so many sectors. There has been, certainly, much broader and larger focus on these Ontarians who suffer from mental health and addictions issues, which is actually a good thing.", "I also was privileged to sit on the Waterloo Region Crime Prevention Council for some years. This is a council whose mission, with three pillars at one time, is to really focus on addressing the root causes of crime in our community, poverty reduction, alienation and a number of things. But it came to light, with so many of our partners around the table from police services, education, youth services and senior services, across many, many sectors—that really identified the fact that mental health and addictions issues cost us all across many, many sectors. So at that point, a few years ago, the crime prevention council added a fourth pillar, mental health and addictions, to start more intensive work on that particular file.", "It’s interesting that across all sectors, I think, we’re now seeing the need for increased mental health awareness and also more services.", "I did want to lend my support to Bill 95, but I also recognize that the Ontario government is doing many things to already address some of the things that we’re talking about here.", "For instance, I know that a single provincial coordinating body, as proposed in Bill 95, would not recognize the diversity of local needs. Health care services, as we know, are best managed at the local level, where they can be delivered and properly integrated into the community. I certainly learned about the diversity in my own community of Cambridge and, indeed, Waterloo region, through my work at the crime prevention council—to find out that our needs in our local area were sometimes very different across the province.", "We also recognize that one in five Ontarians experience mental health illnesses in their lifetime. It’s also why our government created a comprehensive mental health and addictions strategy, which I’m proud of, to support Ontarians, from childhood to old age, with mental health and addictions problems.", "Speaker, as I said, I’m supportive of Bill 95, but I think it could duplicate some of the work that my ministry is already doing. Last year, we announced the Mental Health and Addictions Leadership Advisory Council, which brings together experts and patients with lived experiences across Ontario. I know from personal experience how valuable that is at a committee table and for some of our leaders to learn about first-hand, to be able to tailor the programs to those who really need the services.", "The council will provide advice on the strategy’s investments, promote collaboration across the sectors and report annually on the strategy’s progress. The council also serves as a central body to identify the issues across and within the mental health and addictions system, and advises us on ways to resolve these issues.", "I also want to point out in my last few minutes that the council also promotes collaboration across the 15 ministries that deliver supports to people with mental health or addictions issues, something that I’m very proud our government is doing.", "In conclusion, as I said, I thank the member from London–Fanshawe for bringing forward a very important issue. I know she has done a lot of work on Bill 95, and certainly I support it in spirit. I also know that I’m proud that we are continuing to work on this file." ],

I’m sorry to say that I didn’t know about it until today, because it came up before I was elected, but I look forward to reading it and seeing some, many or possibly all of its suggestions being implemented by this Legislature.", "We’ve been talking a lot about mental health, and I’ve noticed that we haven’t spoken very much on the part of the bill that’s focusing on addictions. Sometimes we hear of what’s called an addictive personality. I always found that challenging in my work as an optometrist. I used to feel that I wasn’t adequately prepared in my university program for the fact that—we all know that people have different personalities and personality quirks, but oftentimes you’re seeing patients, and you don’t know if people have mental illness, and you’re being a little bit of a detective trying to figure it out. As an optometrist, you don’t know if people have addictions—whether it’s legal drug addictions, illegal drug addictions or something else entirely—that are causing them to have visual problems. People have red eyes, people have dry eyes—people have all kinds of problems with their eyes, and you often feel a little bit lost in terms of how to commence that discussion.", "I think it’s something that we have to teach not just the health care professionals and the teachers in our communities, but all of us. It needs to involve all of us—parents, siblings, friends and neighbours—to think in the back of our heads of what we can do to support people in our communities and in our families and help them deal with possible mental health problems, but also that addictive personality, to kind of catch people before they get into trouble.", "This week, we’ve heard a lot about children’s mental health. There have been some fantastic events going on in communities all around the GTA and Ontario. Just on Monday, I was with some members of the Legislature at a fantastic event. It was highlighting some videos done by youth in our communities—high school students, university students—who work to get kids to have an understanding of mental health. Maybe that’s where it all has to begin, just like we’ve learned that by getting kids to understand the dangers of smoking, we prepare ourselves for the next generation to be healthier. That’s what we also have to do with mental health: to get kids to understand what mental health challenges are, that it’s an illness; not to stigmatize people, not to bully people and to be supportive and understanding.", "I really want to congratulate the winning team for their “Will You Be There?” video. It was a group of high school students, interestingly enough. They really had a very emotional video. The hashtag, if you want to look for some of the comments and videos and links, is #ChangetheView2015. There’s a website, thenewmentality.ca. Jasmine from The New Mentality: It’s “a network promoting youth engagement in mental health and reducing the stigma of mental illness.” She’s so welcoming, and you can see why the kids want to work with her and work on these projects.", "There are events going on that we can attend, and that’s wonderful. We’re all invited to events, but there’s so much more that we can do, as legislators, in our community in terms of promoting awareness and ending the stigma. I think that maybe we’re sometimes part of the problem and not enough of the solution when we don’t write about it in the columns we sometimes write for our local paper, when we don’t talk about the anxiety and the panic attacks we go through during an election campaign—which can be very stressful, as you know.", "There’s the “What’s Up” Walk-In Clinic in Toronto. It’s open five days a week for mental health counselling. It’s a service for children, youth, young adults and families.", "At the event that I just mentioned, I spoke to Chris Brown from the East Metro Youth Services, and I invite people to spread the word. That’s what we have our websites for; that’s what we have our social media for: to spread the word, use our constituency offices, call up and get pamphlets from anything that is within walking distance or public transit of our constituency offices. Also, there’s Telehealth and there are phone numbers that people can call and get help.", "I also met with the York Centre for Children, Youth and Families. I was really impressed with the dedication and the fact that they reached out to me because, unfortunately, that’s how it has to be done; we’re not always aware of all the groups in our community to interact with. Noreen Lee really highlighted some of the challenges in York region in terms of getting access to mental health support, particularly for youth. Too often, what people tell me is that until you go to an emergency room and a child or teenager or young adult is threatening suicide, you do not get help.", "So when we talk about these waiting lists, what do they really mean? They mean that if you just ask your family doctor to refer you to get an appointment, you’re basically never getting seen, pretty much, so either the problem resolves itself or the worst, the unimaginable, happens. So I think we can do better, and I hope that we will do better." ],

We published this report, Navigating the Journey to Wellness: The Comprehensive Mental Health and Addictions Action Plan for Ontarians. The report was published and made public in August 2010. Unfortunately, since 2010, not much has changed. So I congratulate my colleague from London–Fanshawe for bringing forward our first recommendation.", "The report is so simple, although we spent a ton of time on it: 18 months, 230 deputants. We went to Toronto, Windsor, St. Thomas, Hamilton, Kingston, Ottawa, Sudbury and Thunder Bay. We visited Weeneebayko on the James Bay coast. We went to fly in-only reserves. We really reached out to and visited a lot of best practices in mental health and addiction that exist right here in Ontario. We put all of this knowledge together in an 18-page document; 18 pages is what we have, and it’s the way forward.", "Our first recommendation, and the one that is included in the member from London–Fanshawe’s bill, is the most important one: It is to give mental health and addiction a home. It is to create an agency whose responsibility will be to cut across the 13 different ministries who presently have bits and pieces of mental health. The sad thing, Speaker—and you would very well know this—is that when they came and presented at committee, most of those ministries would say, “Yes, we do this, but take it away. We would be really, really happy if somebody else could do this and not us.” I can still remember the people from corrections saying that, yes, they do have all of those inmates that have mental health issues, and they needed help. The budget that they had allocated to that was not working.", "So we took all of this, and we were able to summarize it into 18 pages and 23 recommendations, where the number one recommendation is to create Mental Health and Addictions Ontario. We spent a lot of time going through what the mandate of this organization will be. We’re not trying to create a new ministry; we’re not trying to reinvent the wheel. We’re giving mental health and addiction a home so that somebody has a responsibility to move this important file forward to improve it.", "Unfortunately, I’m out of time; I could go on.

In communities throughout the province, we have allocated significant resources so that patients, their families and caregivers are given access to the care and services they need when they need it. We’ve done this because we know how deeply mental health issues affect Ontario families. As we heard earlier, one in five Ontarians will experience a mental health illness in their lifetime. Nearly everyone, as we all know, will be affected in some way, either directly or indirectly, through a family member, a friend, or a loved one. That’s why our government created a comprehensive mental health and addictions strategy to support Ontarians from childhood to old age with mental health and addictions issues.", "Since 2003, funding for mental health and addictions services has increased by over $506 million to a total of $1 billion. Just think about it. That is a lot of money. Why are we doing this? Because we know that there are Ontarians out there who need real support. That’s what governments should be doing: giving people support.", "Our plan is also to increase funding by $220 million over three years as we renew our commitment to our mental health and addictions strategy. The first three years were focused on the early years of life and provided more than 50,000 additional children and youth access to mental health and addictions services. Amazing.", "In November, we announced our strategy’s phase 2. Phase 2 addresses better access, quality and value by focusing on five strategic goals. We will also invest $16 million over the next three years and work with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing to create 1,000 new supportive housing units.", "Many aspects of Bill 95 mirror the work, as I mentioned, that is already under way in the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. The purpose of creating an agency like the Mental Health and Addictions Ontario proposed in Bill 95 is already being fulfilled by the Mental Health and Addictions Leadership Advisory Council, our local health integration networks, the Ministry of Children and Youth Services, and our government’s patient ombudsman. Finally, the MHALAC promotes collaboration across the 15 ministries delivering supports to people with mental illness or addictions. This is reflective of the diversity of the needs of the people with mental illness or addictions.", "Health care services are best managed at the local level, where they can be delivered and properly integrated into the community. This is how we deliver the best care possible to the people of Ontario. We need to remain focused on providing Ontarians with the best care possible. That’s why I urge my fellow members to support this bill but to keep in mind that we are doing what’s best for the people of this province. Be careful not to create confusion and needless redundancies as we move ahead, but together we will create a great health care system." ],

In May 2014, Barrie police arrested eight people connected to a fentanyl patch scheme with links to North Bay and Toronto. These are just a couple of examples of the serious crime issues, but I can tell you, and the officers from the North Bay Police Service can tell you, that they were making arrests on a weekly, if not daily, basis directly related to the trafficking of fentanyl patches. That’s now been greatly reduced due to this Patch 4 Patch program. Not only are there serious health considerations; the sale of these patches is empowering criminal elements in communities across the province, straining our policing resources.", "The Ontario College of Pharmacists notes in the winter 2015 edition of their publication, Pharmacy Connection, that the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police is leading this Patch 4 Patch Initiative.

The Patch 4 Patch Initiative is an important step in reducing deaths from accidental fentanyl overdoses, which have more than doubled in Ontario since 2008.”", "What is Bill 33 all about? What is a Patch 4 Patch policy? Well, I am joined here in the Legislature today by the very folks who pioneered the Patch 4 Patch program in North Bay that has had such wonderful success in curbing the trend of drug abuse.", "Pat Cliche—a dear, lifelong friend of mine—of the North Bay anti-drug strategy is here today. North Bay police detective constables Brad Reaume and Tom Robertson are here today. I welcome all of you for being here. In addition, Carlene Variyan of RBP Canada, who is very supportive of the program, is here today.", "We had a wonderful news conference at 1:15, and we are enjoying the support that has happened—I haven’t even told you—between 1:15 and now. The phone is ringing and the emails are coming in, looking for how they can help. We’re thrilled.", "Bill 33 would require a person prescribing fentanyl patches to record on the prescription the name and location of the pharmacy that will fill the prescription, and to notify the pharmacy about the prescription. It also sets out various rules that apply to persons who dispense fentanyl patches, including a requirement that a new fentanyl patch may only be dispensed if the dispenser collects a used fentanyl patch from the patient or his or her authorized representative. It would also authorize the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make regulations.", "Basically, here is how Patch 4 Patch has been working so successfully in North Bay and now in many other cities, and why it needs to be a legislated process across the province. This policy, developed in partnership with local doctors and pharmacists, stipulates that in order for patients to get a new fentanyl patch, they have to return the old one intact—pretty simple. Pat and the others can tell you that it has a positive effect in North Bay. Now, 22 other communities have adopted the Patch 4 Patch solution, 17 are in the process of adopting it and three more are considering it.", "In Guelph, the Wellington Guelph Drug Strategy produced an informational video on the problem of fentanyl abuse last fall as part of their program launch. Other communities to get on board include Windsor, Peterborough, Sault Ste. Marie, St. Thomas, Sudbury, Timmins and Muskoka. Right now, this is being done on a voluntary basis, community by community. It’s a patchwork solution, if you’ll pardon the pun.", "The problem is this: So long as a person has a means of transportation to get to a community without a Patch 4 Patch policy, they can still continue this chain of abuse. That’s why it’s so important to have a province-wide solution and why we brought this bill forward.", "There are several other reasons to do this:", "—to generate public education and awareness regarding fentanyl abuse and misuse, and to guarantee responsible provision of this potentially deadly drug;", "—to address proper disposal of fentanyl patches to avoid harm to others;", "—to address an identified increase in associated crime in the community;", "—increases seen in the number of overdoses and mortality rates; and", "—the significant amount of medical resources these cases can use.", "The benefits of doing this are plentiful:", "—partnerships with law enforcement, physicians and pharmacists to ensure proper return and disposal of fentanyl patches;", "—an anticipated reduction in accidental and non-accidental overdoses from fentanyl. A comprehensive evaluation is currently under way in North Bay;", "—limiting the trafficking of fentanyl;", "—eliminating the return of counterfeit fentanyl patches and other issues around fentanyl use;", "—reduction of the amount of fentanyl on our streets assists local police, as investigations require significant time and substantial police resources to build cases against those with a legitimate prescription;", "—assists local efforts to develop public education and awareness programs with various community partners; and", "—benefits seen from sharing best practices among numerous areas across the province.", "Obviously, any such legislation needs to have a deterrent component to be effective and enforceable. To address that, the bill provides a flexible response. For example, it would allow regulatory oversight bodies to determine if their members are adhering to professional conduct standards and to determine what, if any, action is required if those standards are not being upheld. As well, the bill gives the minister the power to make regulations to deal with a variety of issues that may arise.", "I have to say that I was very pleased to receive a response from Minister Hoskins to my order paper question about fentanyl abuse. It stated, “The ministry is supportive of this initiative as it is showing promise in reducing diversion and misuse of fentanyl in communities that have implemented it.” I’d like to say to the minister that I would like to work with you moving forward on this.", "In closing, I want to say that I believe the approach advocated in my Bill 33, which has already produced positive results in North Bay, is a model that will curb the dangerous and growing trend of fentanyl abuse across Ontario. This bill is about saving lives and helping the most vulnerable people in Ontario. Remember the words of Sherry Albert of New Liskeard and try to put yourself in her shoes." ],

I commend the member for Nipissing for bringing forward a bill such as this.", "Some of you may not know that before I came here, for many years I was a dental assistant. The office that I worked in was right in downtown Windsor. A few blocks over from the office that I worked in was the Salvation Army. They used to run a drug rehab program out of the Salvation Army, separate from the other services they provide. Often, we would service the clientele in the rehab program. They would come in, and they were obviously coming in with some sort of dental issue, usually pain associated with it. We were always pleased to give them the treatment that they needed, but unfortunately, because of the program that they were in, there were strict rules around what we were allowed to prescribe them for their pain.", "Certainly these are people who have come forward and recognized that they have an addiction issue and are trying to get over that. As many people would know, it’s very difficult, once you have an addiction, to get over that addiction. They need all the support that they can. So they would come into the office and we would do the dental treatment that was required. Although we weren’t dispensing narcotics or writing prescriptions for narcotics, because we certainly wanted to support them to try to get over their addiction, even if we were giving them antibiotics for something, there was a policy through not only our office but through the rehabilitation program that we were required to call in to one specific pharmacy, let them know who the patient was and let them know what it was we were prescribing. That patient was not able to go to the pharmacy and directly pick up that medication. It was sent to the rehab program at the Salvation Army and it was locked up in a dispensary. They had people at the Salvation Army who would then administer any medications, give out any medications that anyone in the program needed. That was their way of helping support those who were in the program trying to kick the addiction that they had.", "I think this is a really important bill, because it talks about how we have people who are dealing with addiction problems, and that’s very difficult for them. Because there are people out there who want to make lots of money any way that they can, unfortunately, they prey on people with addiction issues. This bill helps with that because it sets out a rule that says that in order to receive a fentanyl patch, you have to hand one in. I think that’s a really good control to help those people who are suffering with addiction issues.", "I think it also speaks volumes to trying to curtail criminal activity around people getting hold of prescription drugs and selling them to others. I know, and I’m sure it’s across the province, there were issues around people getting prescriptions for stuff like OxyContin or oxycodone, and they would go into their workplace and would sell off the pills to people. They were making money that way. I think that’s really an unfortunate way for anybody to try to make money, and it’s very dangerous—incredibly dangerous.", "So I think that with something like fentanyl patches—and this is a lot of new information for me. I wasn’t aware that fentanyl patches were used for severe and chronic pain. We all know that people who suffer with chronic pain—that’s not something anybody would want to live with, and we certainly want them supported. But I didn’t realize that these patches were 100 times stronger than morphine or 40 times stronger than heroin. That’s startling to me, to think that there are people out there who would take advantage of someone with an addiction issue and take something like a fentanyl patch and sell it to them to make money for their own benefit, to do whatever it is they want to do with that money, and essentially build on those addictions. Even with people who have legitimate reasons for using fentanyl patches, there’s always a concern of them developing an addiction. Having to return patches that have been used in order to get patches is definitely another way for the medical professionals to keep an eye on somebody to make sure that there isn’t an issue developing and to make sure that these are being used the way that they’re supposed to be.", "I also found it interesting that even after they are used—and used properly, the way they are supposed to be—when it’s time to dispose of them or discard them, there’s still enough medication on them to cause an overdose. So there are concerns for me around that. Unfortunately, I think every community has homeless people, and that’s certainly something that we don’t want to see. But unfortunately, we do have homeless people, and often you will find them accessing, through restaurants or through pharmacies or wherever, private garbage disposals. It’s shocking to me that they could potentially come across something like this that somebody has used, thought it safe to get rid of, thrown it into a garbage, and now they’ve come across it and they don’t think anything of using it. They don’t realize just how dangerous it is for them to be using these. There’s always concern about people accessing medication that was meant for somebody else. There’s always concern about someone using medication that would have an adverse effect against something else that they’re using when they are mixing medications. To think that somebody could come across something, think it’s harmless and use it and could lose their life over it is something that we definitely would like to reduce.", "The member from Nipissing also talked about criminal activity, such as taking these patches and selling them for profit. Having been the community safety and corrections critic, I can speak to the challenges they face inside our correctional services on a daily basis. Their resources are stretched very thin already. They face many challenges. They have those with mental health issues who are put in facilities and who perhaps should be redirected into some sort of community support program rather than put into a correctional facility. They have many people with addiction issues who will do anything to feed their addiction, and ultimately break the law and end up in a correctional facility. These are people who actually could also benefit from supports in the community, something like the Salvation Army rehabilitation program.", "I think that something like this, where a patch has to be handed in before one is given out, would help address that issue.", "In correctional facilities, they are always facing issues with people smuggling drugs in for the inmates, which always causes issues. Something like this would stop something like fentanyl patches from making it into the correctional system. You may have people with addiction issues already in the system, and now you have somebody who is bringing in these fentanyl patches, smuggling them into a correctional facility and feeding into that addiction. Those people tend to cause more issues for the correctional officers in the system. We certainly don’t want to be putting the front-line staff in our correctional facilities at any more risk than they already are, and we certainly don’t want people who are in correctional services who have addiction issues having any more access to the very things that caused their addiction issues.", "I appreciate the time to comment.

As he mentioned, it’s a program that’s already in place. It’s voluntary. A number of municipali Patch 4 Patch patch-for-patch program. What the legislation would do is make it mandatory and remove the patchwork. I believe that his bill has some merit and is definitely worth considering.", "Mr. Speaker, I think I would be remiss if at this point I didn’t speak to a few of the things the government is doing on this issue. A core pillar of our narcotics strategy is the creation of a narcotics monitoring system that collects and analyzes pharmacists’ dispensing data. The information that is collected by the narcotics monitoring system is then used to detect unusual or inappropriate behaviour, identify trends, enhance education initiatives and develop harm reduction strategies. By understanding how monitored drugs are being prescribed and dispensed, and to whom, the ministry can help make the prescribing, dispensing and use of monitored drugs safer and more secure.", "As a matter of fact, since May 14, 2012, all Ontario pharmacies—that’s over 3,600 dispensers—are already submitting dispensing data about monitored drugs to the Narcotics Monitoring System. In the fall of 2013, we established the Narcotics Monitoring Working Group, which includes experts who are making recommendations on potential education strategies and initiatives to reduce narcotics addiction.", "As I mentioned earlier, this is a worthy initiative, but the fact is that no matter how much we legislate, no matter how much we monitor, we also have to focus on education and some of the root causes, something to which the member from Windsor West spoke eloquently. To that end, I would like to speak a little bit about what our government has been doing in trying to not only look at how we can monitor or legislate around addiction, but also at what we can do to address those root causes, because I believe that is where the real solution is. The real solution is in addressing the root causes of mental health and addiction. The real solution is in educating people on the potential harm of addiction or misuse of drugs.", "It’s ironic that so many of these drugs, including fentanyl, are put on the market to help make people’s lives better, but sometimes, because of misuse, end up actually hurting people.", "As all of us know in this House, our government has been very active on the mental health and addictions file. Since 2003, funding for mental health and addiction services has increased by over $506 million to a total of $1 billion, including our plan to increase funding by $220 million over three years as we renew our commitment to our mental health and addictions strategy. It has provided, so far, more than 50,000 additional children and youth with access to mental health and addictions services.", "In November 2014, we announced phase 2 of Ontario’s mental health and addictions strategy. Phase 2 has five pillars: promoting resiliency and well-being in all Ontarians; ensuring early identification and intervention; expanding housing, employment supports, and diversion and transitions from the justice system; ensuring the right services at the right time and in the right place; and funding based on need and quality.", "All of that said, I would like to reiterate one more time and applaud the member from Nipissing for bringing this legislation forward.

We’ve heard a lot about this in many of our communities. Basically, the bill saying “patch for patch” is, when a patch is dispensed, they have to get the old patch back. This is to control the substance of fentanyl.", "Not everybody knows what fentanyl is, but when OxyContin became harder to get on the streets because of changing legislation, drug users would turn to the fentanyl patch. Fentanyl is a narcotic, but it’s generally prescribed as a slow-release form of pain medication. About three days’ worth of medication is in the patch. It was used for pain control. When the need for drugs or a high by drug users came in, fentanyl patches were highly sought after. They would find who was using the patches and they would cut them up into little pieces. They could apply it to their gums to absorb it in their mouths, or sometimes they would smoke the medication.", "In my community of Brock township, I was getting some phone calls about the apparent suicides or maybe overdoses in that community. It was on the border of Brock and York region, kind of the Beaverton, Georgina, Sutton area. I phoned up the mayor at the time, Terry Clayton, who is in the gallery with us today, and he contacted, I believe, a Durham region police officer. They’re also represented here today with Inspector James Stuart-Haass. So they have come down today, and they are an example of a community where we saw something happening that was, as the mayor said, a “community tragedy,” and how do we address this?", "I can’t say how proud I am of the community that came together with the Durham region police, the York region police. At the first meeting there were crown attorneys there; the coroner’s office was there; of course, the municipal council, the health unit, the high school of Brock township, the Canadian Mental Health Association, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Pinewood Centre for Addictions were there. It was just amazing that they came together to say what was happening, because in that 18-month period, eight people had died, and none of those eight people had prescriptions for the drug, the fentanyl patch.", "I wanted to put that into perspective because it’s not about the drug itself; it’s about the control of the drug. It’s narcotics safety and it’s public safety. That was covered in our newspaper, the Brock Citizen at the time. I’ve asked about and followed this as it’s proceeded since—I believe that we started to get on this in that area in 2013. Now, when I check in with the Durham region police, they’re saying that people are actually attempting to forge prescriptions, which is a good sign. They’re not able to get them off the street, is what we’re saying. So it is a good sign.", "The member from Nipissing said that North Bay was the first to start this Patch 4 Patch program—his guests are here, and I welcome them also to the Legislature; I think Durham region was the third. Peterborough now has it also. My local pharmacist in Lindsay, Cathy Puffer, was named Canadian Pharmacist of the Year by the Canadian Pharmacists Association, and she had brought it over to Lindsay and the Kawartha Lakes area, the Patch 4 Patch program.", "It’s reducing the accidental fentanyl patch overdoses because, of course, people who are using drugs are in a state of mind—mental health and addictions. They don’t realize the potency of this fentanyl patch.", "I have had deaths located in Kawartha Lakes also that are connected to overdose. One tragic story is that the young man was working to get off his addictions. He was trying to work with a methadone clinic. It’s very difficult, fighting addictions. He was having trouble. He had no idea of the potency of the patch that he bought on the street. Unfortunately, his parents went to his apartment in Lindsay and found that he had passed away. That is the incident that the member from Nipissing brought forward in the examples from his home: that this just occurs now; it is evolving. These community members that I mentioned, the pharmacists involved, all do this voluntarily, which is great, but the member here is asking for some legislative help.", "We as provincial policy-makers need to look at this, and I think we should all today agree that the private member’s bill he has brought forward and rightfully named the Safeguarding our Communities Act, when brought into law, will help these great community people, the pharmacists, the health care providers, the police services, the health units. It will help them to stop this terrible tragedy that does occur in our communities. I hope, just even by highlighting it here in the Legislature, that more communities want to come on board.", "I know it was mentioned that Deputy Chief Burns at the time said that “the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police is working on a province-wide strategy on fentanyl.”", "I think here, today, if we can all agree that this is a good piece of legislation—and there are actually many nurses in the Legislature this time, but even today, they are nodding their heads; we see it as health care providers—and it’s something that needs to be addressed.

You don’t get to that kind of medication as a first line. People, for many different reasons—through accidents, through severe diseases—just cannot bear to live with pain anymore. As they go through the system, they will go from different classes and categories of painkillers. I would say that fentanyl patches are kind of at the end of that road, where you have tried other opiates, you have tried other narcotics, and then you end up on that type of medication, often with other systems to help you support your pain. Then they thrive, and then, finally, they can resume—sort of—the normal activities of daily living, and their pain is under control.", "So is this medication important? Yes, absolutely. The problem is that, as has been said before, it is very potent. If you have not had this buildup of opiate medication in your system and you put this on the first time, you are at really high risk of dying. Your brain will stop you from breathing. All of a sudden you will breathe very, very shallowly or you will breathe, then forget to breathe for a couple of minutes, then take another breath and then—you die. It is as simple as that. Your friends may all be high around you and partying, but you become very quiet and you suddenly stop breathing.

My community, the city of Greater Sudbury, is looking at this. The pattern is always the same. Those communities came to the decision to put the Patch 4 Patch system in place after tragedy struck, after the life—usually of a young, thriving person—is taken away.", "Let’s be a little bit more proactive about this. Let’s do a little bit of health promotion. Let’s put this system that has been proven to work to save lives—let’s implement it throughout Ontario. Let’s not wait until there are 15, 20, 30, hundreds more deaths from the misuse of that medication before we actually act. We have a chance to save lives today, and this is by passing this bill.

We must act now. Where this practice of patch-for-patch dispensing of the drug has been used, the availability has been curbed, making the drug much harder to get. That’s what it’s all really about: making it much harder for people to get this drug.", "Getting as much of the drug off the street as possible is truly a goal that we must strive for. I’m happy to hear that the debate today is in support for the Patch 4 Patch program and that it doesn’t hinder the proper or legal use of the drug for people who need it to manage pain.

This is a common analgesic that we give to post-operative patients for hip and knee replacement and is very commonly dispensed.", "While listening attentively to my colleague opposite talking about the bill and his passion for making sure that every young Ontarian, all Ontarians in general, not be part of this addiction and the abuse of this particular drug—this prescribed medication. But the bill in itself focuses only on the dispenser and the prescriber—meaning physicians and pharmacists, yet his comments to us this afternoon talk about public education, use and misuse—because it is absolutely correct that we need to do a better job collectively, not just in this chamber but province-wide, in terms of public education about narcotics in general.", "I know that the member opposite, from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock, talked about different ways—what we call the route—the pharmacokinetics of how to administer the fentanyl patch. There are different ways: You can do an IM; an IV; transdermal—that’s when we talk about the patches; transmucosal—that’s underneath the tongue; and what have you.", "The other very serious part about this medication, the member opposite does not really know. As a nurse, we spend a lot of time educating our patients and individuals who are using this kind of narcotic—the whole issue of the onset of the medication and the duration of this medication. In the case of a patch—the patch in itself, the fentanyl patch—the duration is 72 hours. So when someone is applying this particular medication, it is the responsibility of the applicant, in the case of nurses; or the prescribers, the physician; or the dispenser, the pharmacist—must educate the patient. As much as he talks about, in the bill, that there we will do a lot of public education, nowhere in Bill 33 talks about that. When this bill gets discharged to the committee, I would like to see more conversation about that.", "I was very pleased that the member opposite did have a conversation with the College of Pharmacists and the College of Physicians and Surgeons, but it’s beyond that, because you need all the regulated health professionals.

The associate minister, this afternoon, talked about that we need to spend more time, as well as focusing on how to reduce addiction, and how you work with the law enforcement folks to get this off the streets. We’ve got to get to the bottom of prevention and to the root of the problem of addiction. At the end of the day, a child does not become an addict; these are learned behaviours. There’s a root to this problem. Let’s focus on the prevention, because if the focus is almost on the tertiary level—in terms of the criminal justice system or in the case of the addiction—it’s too late. Let’s put more resources and more energy, and focus on the prevention and the education piece.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m very pleased to support the comments and the proposed Bill 33." ],

For weeks, workers in her small northeastern Pennsylvania town had been plumbing natural gas deposits from a drilling rig a few hundred yards away.... Somehow, stray gas worked into tiny crevasses in the rock, leaking upward into the aquifer and slipping quietly into Fiorentino’s well.” Then apparently a spark from her pump caused a blast that “tossed aside a concrete slab weighing several thousand pounds.”", "Ms. Fiorentino lives within a nine-square-mile area where Pennsylvania regulators have banned new gas wells after several high-profile cases of contamination led to a $4.1-million settlement against the gas company.", "Water or gas.

It would ensure that any future interest in fracking for gas in Ontario, high-volume hydraulic fracturing, would be subject to a review by the Legislature—not just by the government of the day meeting in cabinet, but the Legislature itself.", "The choice before us is water or gas.

They sell gas to us or to others, but someday they will have to buy their water.", "Quebec faced this choice and had a review done by its environmental review board. They found that “the activities of the industry could engender consequences for the quality of the environment, particularly on the quality of surface and underground water.” Water or gas.", "In 2011, the US Academy of Sciences released the methane contamination of drinking water study.

One article published by Bloomberg News on April 30 last year was entitled, “Shale Drillers Feast on Junk Debt to Stay on Treadmill,” and they talked about Rice Energy Inc., a natural gas producer with risky credit that “raised $900 million in three days this month.” That was April of last year. Not bad, especially since it has lost money three years in a row and has drilled fewer than 50 wells—most named after superheroes and monster trucks.

That’s seven steps below investment grade. Most pension funds, most insurance companies wouldn’t be allowed to buy this kind of investment. In a related Bloomberg article, it was reported that Standard and Poor’s says that of the 97 energy exploration and production companies it grades, 75 are rated below investment grade.", "It’s not just one company; it’s a whole industry that floats on junk bonds. If there’s as much oil and gas as the shale industry says there is, then why are their investments speculative? Why, Speaker? Maybe they know something about the long-run production that the rest of us should know.", "The industry says there are huge amounts of gas, but the well-respected journal Nature published an article in December called “Natural Gas: The Fracking Fallacy.” They reported that companies are betting big on natural gas, investing, in the United States, hundreds of billions of dollars in new plants that rely on natural gas: fertilizer plants, chemical plants, electricity generation. The industry is working very hard to increase demand dramatically, and we all know what happens when demand is increased dramatically: The price follows.", "When academics reanalyzed the data, they found that there are substantial risks here for society as a whole—very substantial risks.

They want to make sure they can get at the last dregs of gas here in Ontario, should prices go through the roof. They don’t want the Legislature to be an obstacle.", "Speaker, the choice before us is simple: Protect our water and farmland or stand aside while the gas fracking industry expands into Ontario.

There are currently no applications before the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry requesting approval to explore for shale gas or oil, or to use high-volume hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking.

Currently, there are no applications—as I just mentioned—before the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry requesting approval to explore for shale gas or oil, or for the use of fracking. Although Ontario has some bedrock units similar to gas-producing shale rocks located in the United States and Quebec, at this time there is no indication that Ontario hosts economic reserves of shale gas.", "The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has a mature regulatory framework—and this is critically important—that is in place and that reflects Ontario’s broad experience regarding the oil and gas industry. Under the Oil, Gas and Salt Resources Act, or the OGSRA, all oil and gas wells, including exploratory wells, must be licensed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry for drilling, operation and plugging. The OGSRA authorizes the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to attach conditions to licenses to ensure the establishment, operation and plugging of wells is done safely and in an environmentally-sensitive manner.", "Further protections include the Clean Water Act, which ensures communities protect their drinking water supplies through prevention by developing collaborative watershed-based plans that are locally driven and based on science. Despite this important protection, it is important, Speaker, to note that unfortunately both opposition parties voted against the Clean Water Act and taking stronger measures to protect our drinking water. The opposition PC Party voted against protecting our Great Lakes and failed to adequately protect drinking water systems while in government.", "Our government is committed to ensuring Ontarians continue to enjoy some of the cleanest drinking water in North America. The Great Lakes are vitally important to the people of Ontario for our drinking water, our quality of life and prosperity. We need to restore them now to continue to enjoy their benefits for this and future generations. That is why we reintroduced a strengthened Great Lakes Protection Act this year which recognizes the importance of the Great Lakes to Ontario’s economy, environment and the health of our citizens.

As such, Bill 82 is completely unnecessary. Mr. Speaker, it sends the wrong message to an industry that has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure and employs thousands of individuals in communities right across this province, and in my own as well. The fact of the matter is that hydraulic fracture treatment of oil and natural gas wells to improve production rates has been in use in this province, as a couple of speakers have already said, for more than 60 years. This practice has also been safely used in Ontario for conventional vertical wells for almost as long. In southwestern Ontario, more than 140 companies are in the oil and natural gas business, and they contribute over $4 billion to the oil and gas sector and to the provincial economy.", "Natural gas from shale formations in the northeastern United States already makes up—and this is important—50% of the gas that’s used in Ontario at this time. Residents of Toronto and other parts of Ontario are already benefiting from gas fracture that’s taking place already. I don’t know whether that’s a dog-in-the-manger attitude, that we’ve got it and we don’t want the rest of the people in rural Ontario to. Many people in rural Ontario would like to have gas, and there’s gas there. There’s a surplus of gas that we would like to make available to rural Ontario.", "The Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and the Premier herself said they want to expand agriculture in Ontario. They want to see the agricultural economy improve. The only way they’re going to do that, to heat their homes and their barns and to dry grain, is with access to a surplus of natural gas which is available. I wanted to get that on the record.", "Also, being parochial, in my riding of Sarnia–Lambton shale gas has made a world of difference. It’s been a game-changer in the petrolchemical industry. They were on their last legs prior to 2007-08.", "Before I came to this House—some people said it got better after I left, but anyway, when I left to come here, shale gas was just coming on stream in the northeastern United States. The company I worked for, Nova Chemicals, had access to that Marcellus Shale.

The opportunity to lower energy rates and for economic growth and increased investment is theirs for the taking.", "I’m certain that if the member from Toronto–Danforth asked his colleagues from rural Ontario, like the members from Timmins–James Bay, Kenora–Rainy River, Timiskaming–Cochrane, Algoma–Manitoulin, Nickel Belt and many others, they would say they’d like access to natural gas for their municipalities. They don’t have it today, but they’d like to get it. Also for the members across the aisle, I know there are members from Thunder Bay–Superior North, Sault Ste. Marie, Ancaster–Dundas–Flamborough–Westdale, and Sudbury who also need natural gas in their ridings.", "As I said, I’m going to share my time with my colleague.

My question to the Premier was: Would we allow the examples set in Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and place a moratorium on fracking in Ontario? The answer given by the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry was that there was no need because there was no fracking under way, and if anyone applied for a fracking licence, it would require a legislative change.", "I urged the minister to act anyway, because of the lawsuits that have been launched in the United States claiming Quebec had no right to interfere with an American company wanting to frack below the St. Lawrence River, which leads us today to Bill 82, thanks to the member from Toronto–Danforth, Mr. Tabuns.", "Speaker, I don’t have to tell you how easy it is to get on the Internet these days and do a search on fracking. Just a few strokes of the keyboard and you can get it. I found there are 500,000 fracking wells in America, each requiring 400 tanker loads of water. I won’t burden you with the math, Speaker, but think about it: 500,000 wells, each with 400 tanker trucks back and forth, day after day. That’s a lot of air pollution at a time when most of us are expressing grave concern about greenhouse gases.", "To complete each fracking job, it takes anywhere from one million to eight million gallons of water, water that will never be used for drinking or recreational purposes again. That water is mixed with sand and chemicals to create what is known as a fracking fluid. For each of these 500,000 wells, it takes about 40,000 gallons of fracking fluid.", "At this point, let me point out that each of those wells can be fracked at least 18 times. If you’re still doing the math on 500,000 wells, 400 tanker trucks and all of that, it adds up. I won’t bother you with the math. They’re talking about 72 trillion gallons of water, 360 billion gallons of chemicals. It boggles the mind.", "When scientists look at the content in this chemical cocktail, there are 600 chemicals used in fracking fluid. I hope it shocks you, Speaker. It shocked me. There are known carcinogens and toxins in that fracking fluid: lead, mercury, uranium, radium, methanol, formaldehyde and hydrochloric acid.", "So they take this chemical cocktail; they flush it down. It goes a mile or two beneath the surface. Pressurized water comes out, then fractures the rock or splinters it, and then the natural gas comes in. It sounds simple, except for the methane gas and toxic chemicals getting in below the earth and staying there, contaminating the groundwater.", "When scientists sample the methane in wells used for drinking water near these fracking sites, the methane levels are as much as 17 times higher than in water wells further away. The scientists have documented this. They say that contaminated well water can cause sensory, respiratory and neurological damage.", "We’ve mentioned the huge amounts of water that’s required in each of these wells. Only 30% to 50% of that water—the water that’s mixed with sand and chemicals—is recovered. The rest stays below the surface, and it’s not biodegradable. The recovered water—let’s not even call it water; it’s more waste fluid—is brought up, trucked away and dumped in open-air pits to evaporate. Of course, as the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change will tell you, this contaminated fluid will release into the air harmful volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. These VOCs contaminate the air and trigger acid rain as well as ground-level ozone.", "That’s where we’re at, Speaker. We can sit on these 300,000 barrels of natural gas a day, or we can pay the long-term price to our environment and risk the damage to our natural environment and hope and pray we don’t have an accident. I think the price is too high. I think that stuff should stay where it is.", "The problem is that this industry has just blossomed. It’s out there, but there hasn’t been enough scientific evaluation of how it’s done and what the repercussions are. We need the science to catch up to the industry on this. We have so many earthquakes all around us. There was one outside Detroit last week—what was it?—4.2 on the Richter scale. We’ve had earthquakes around Amherstburg and Leamington. They’ve had them up in Aurora. We don’t need to gamble on accidents. We don’t need to gamble that an earthquake is somehow going to fracture something below the ground and all of this fluid is going to get into our groundwater.", "I hope to have more to say on it later. I know I’m rapidly running out of time here, and I know the member for Parkdale–High Park wants to speak on this issue as well. But I guess if I have any advice at all, it’s to go very slow on this. We don’t want to allow fracking if it’s going to cause long-term damage in this community. It has been banned pretty well everywhere else in our immediate neighbourhoods.

Well, the truth is that Ontario does have a sizable oil and gas industry that does create jobs and builds this province, and Ontario engineers, trades, fabricators, suppliers and service providers do earn their living serving the Ontario oil and gas sector. In fact, oil has been extracted from Ontario for more than 150 years, and oil and gas shale deposits identified in the United States might not stop at the political border that Canada has with the United States.", "So would reasonable people acting in a rational manner foreswear the responsible and prudent extraction of oil and gas from Ontario sources for all time, knowing fully that the supplies of oil and gas consumed by Ontarians already come from sources whose resources are extracted using shale fracturing techniques?", "This proposal by the member for Toronto–Danforth asks Ontarians to assume that petroleum and gas prices will always be low, that the Middle East will never constrict supplies for political and conflict purposes, that economic growth in North America will always be sluggish and that interest rates will never rise. Everyone who has been alive for more than 20 years knows that all of these underlying assumptions are false.", "Do you know why your bills for natural gas in recent years have fallen by close to half? It’s because of an abundance of supply created by extracting natural gas from shale deposits in North America. The member’s bill would expose you to a shortage of supply and raise prices to heat your home in the wintertime. Just this morning, the same member levelled his criticism at our world-class nuclear power industry. So he has come out squarely against the two most economic, abundant and available sources of electrical and heating energy that we use in the province of Ontario.", "Though your natural gas bill doesn’t show where your home heating fuel comes from, it’s worth letting Ontarians know that half your natural gas comes from sources where it is obtained by shale fracturing—half. Does the member for Toronto–Danforth think it’s okay to extract gas by shale fracturing in the United States or in other parts of Canada, but just not in Ontario? Did the member for Toronto–Danforth spend any time at all considering the impact on Ontario’s oil and gas sector before drafting this reactionary bill? I actually know the answer to that: He did no consultation whatsoever.", "What this means is that this bill proposes to ban a process that is not taking place and for which nobody is applying for a permit. What a slap in the face to rural Ontario, where people expect Ontario gas companies and their government to work with municipalities to extend natural gas pipelines and enable supply into more areas in rural Ontario. Our gas delivery companies—Enbridge, Union Gas and others—have a record of safely, responsibly and economically delivering natural gas here in Ontario that extends back more than a century. Our suppliers have invested billions of dollars in Ontario.", "The correct way to deal with oil and gas extraction through shale fracturing is to allow Ontario towns and cities and their people to consider the merits and drawbacks of shale fracturing through a sensible dialogue, such as what would be achieved in the next version of the long-term energy plan, scheduled for 2016. That would be a fair and prudent way of using the ample time that Ontario has to consider how to develop the potential of Ontario’s very own prospecting, extraction, refining, distributing and marketing of petroleum resources.", "As nobody is extracting oil and gas through shale fracturing, nor is proposing to do so, there is absolutely no need to rush to an arbitrary ban over something that isn’t taking place that would certainly prove inappropriate in a broader and more responsible study of how oil and gas should best contribute to Ontario’s total energy supply and demand, now and in the decades going forward.", "So I cannot and will not support this bill, and I urge members to reject its narrow approach to the Ontario oil and gas sector." ],

I get it. He likes having a warm home, though. As my colleague Bob Bailey said, and the member from Mississauga–Streetsville—Bob and Bob—50% of the gas that we use today comes from shale deposits in the United States.", "I remember early in my career here when the price of natural gas was at least double, maybe almost three times what it is today. We were talking about liquefied natural gas that was going to be our next source of supply because there was, at maximum, maybe 25 to 30 years of gas supply left here in North America. We were going to be bringing that in from the Middle East by ship, liquefied, in tankers. That’s the real environmental way to be shipping this stuff, eh? And then we were going to be processing it in ports. All these plants were going to be built on the seacoasts of the country, and we were going to be reprocessing it into a way that we could use it here in our homes.", "Then we were talking about—maybe we’re looking at gas—$13 or $15 natural gas. Today, it averages, depending upon the season, somewhere between just under $3 up to $4 a cubic metre. It is the shale discoveries that have allowed that to happen.", "One of the biggest problems we have in this province today is the price of electricity. If we didn’t have access to cheap natural gas—I know my friend doesn’t want to see nuclear power—can you imagine the cost of running the 19 natural gas power plants we have in this province if we were dealing with $10 or $13 natural gas? We have to ask ourselves, “Is that really where we can afford to go?”", "I absolutely believe that anything that will happen in the future will be done in an absolutely environmentally responsible way. I expect this government or any other government to conduct it in that fashion. This is not going to be a free-for-all. We’re going to make sure that the environment is always protected in whatever we happen to do.", "But from the point of view of passing a bill such as this—and I understand how he feels about this—once you close the door to this practice, you are never going to re-open it. You will never get it re-opened. It is much easier—there is no fracking going on in Ontario today but we do have to have that option, should we need it. If you close the door to this practice being done in an environmental way, you will never get that door open again. That would be wrong." ],

More importantly, the bill is crafted in such a way that future governments, or any government, cannot, through regulation, create exemptions for stand-alone facilities that would use coal to generate electricity.", "What is really interesting, of course, is the fact that the plan was to stop using coal to generate electricity as of December 31, 2014, but here in Ontario we were actually able to stop that well before December 2014. In many ways, the bill is catching up with the reality. Usually it is reality that has to catch up with legislation. But, in this case, it’s a good-news story.

It wasn’t an easy decision to be made. It wasn’t easy, because it’s cheaper to burn coal. It’s the old story of many people always want the cheapest, not always what’s best for the environment and perhaps the economy at large.", "They look at the cost based on other forms of producing electricity that are more costly, and yet people within the scientific and medical field have clearly revealed—and among them was the Ontario Medical Association—the damaging effect of coal, the burning of coal for electricity in the province of Ontario, on the health of Ontarians.", "I can recall on many occasions going back home to St. Catharines and looking at the ugly yellow streak coming across the sky from the Nanticoke Generating Station. That was coal being used to produce electricity. That contamination was going over the Niagara Peninsula, but also over northwestern New York state. The end of the use of coal in those facilities has made a remarkable difference.", "We know that there are other factors that influence air contamination and air pollution, but if you look at the last couple of summers, where we usually have high alerts for pollution, the number of days which were smog days, as we used to call them, has, at least in the last couple of years, since ending the use of coal for the production of electricity—that has diminished remarkably. That means better air quality in our province and better health for people in our province. The federal government, which likes to drag its feet sometimes on environmental initiatives of this kind, is out bragging about how much air pollution has been reduced and what a contribution we are making as a country to reducing greenhouse gases, and it’s using the Ontario example, that Ontario example being the discontinuation of the burning of coal for the production of electricity in this province.", "Other options are being used—more benign options. Certainly, for many years we have had electrical power produced by hydro, that being water production. There are many smaller initiatives in that regard now. At one time, Ontario Hydro, as it was called, really didn’t like these smaller units. They loved the big units, the big nukes, the big units such as Niagara Falls. We’ve expanded that. There’s far more production coming now, despite the fact that the topography of Ontario in the north is rather flat instead of like this—that is, almost vertical in Quebec. We’re able to produce a significant amount of electricity utilizing hydro power, which is water power, of course.", "We have nuclear generating stations which produce a significant amount of power in this province and have operated over the years, providing that base power.", "We’re looking at new ways of generating electricity which again are much more environmentally benign than the burning of coal was. The cleaner electricity, the greener electricity that we’re using, has made an impact.", "Does some of this, such as the nuclear plants, contribute to the cost? It does. If you look at nuclear production in Ontario, how many times have you ever seen any one of these operations come in on time and on budget? Well, the answer is never, because they never have, nor does the refurbishing. But the enemy of the good is the perfect, and we struggle with that. We do the best we can. It is a fact that nuclear produces electricity in this province, for instance. We have to work hard as a province, as other jurisdictions do, to ensure the cost overruns are not out of this world, as they have been in the past.", "One of the best ways of dealing with the challenge that we have out there environmentally is conservation, and governments should be very aggressive. Our government has taken a number of steps forward in this regard, but all governments have to be even more aggressive in terms of conservation.", "The environment minister has been to California recently, and there are some rather remarkable new initiatives taking place there that really could make a huge impact, particularly on individual homes, but also on virtually every business as well, in terms of new batteries, in terms of solar power and so on. These initiatives are happening quickly.", "I see that in the province of Alberta the new Premier has said that one of her goals is to reduce coal-burning for the purpose of producing electricity in Alberta.", "South of the border, President Obama has introduced many initiatives that are designed, again, to reduce and perhaps someday eliminate the use of coal for the production of electricity.", "This is not to say that coal will never be used for any purpose in Ontario, and this bill doesn’t address that.", "Some people will say, “Well, why do you need a bill of this kind?” You need it because governments—and this is a hard argument for a government side to make, because usually when you’re in opposition you make this argument, and that is, the difference between regulation and legislation. When I sat on the other side of the House, I always thought legislation was very important. Now here I am on this side of the House, once again saying that legislation is more important than regulation. I can’t claim consistency in all aspects of government policy in this regard, but I can say that in this particular place, I think it’s important that a government not be—they say “behind closed doors”; that simply means within cabinet—committees in cabinet. A government cannot make this decision to reopen these plants or start new plants burning coal for the purpose of producing electricity. It would take the consent of this Legislature and a full debate in this legislature, and I think that’s good.", "I happen to be one who believes—and I have the distinction of being deputy House leader, which is a challenging point in this regard—that having as much debate as reasonable and possible on legislation is very good. I think that the debate we have here is good.", "I think there’s a good consensus out there now. At one time, some people were fighting it. I used to jokingly say in the House, with interjections at the wrong time, that Old King Coal was a Tory, from “Old King Cole was a merry old soul.” But I think there have even been conversions on the road to Damascus over there. Some of the people on the Conservative benches who were very reluctant to end coal recognize its damaging effects in the production of electricity, and I think there’s pretty well a consensus now.", "My good friend, and the former member for Kitchener–Waterloo, Elizabeth Witmer, was a person who believed in it, and indeed she started the conversion of Lakeview out of the use of coal. I commend her for that, and I have been a long-time champion of her doing that on that occasion.", "I think that some of her colleagues have now come along to say that despite the fact that it’s very cheap to produce electricity that way in one particular riding or another, perhaps it isn’t the way we should go. So I suspect—although I can’t tell from the last vote we had in the House; it’s hard to say—that in this case it would be unanimous in this regard.", "I know that the moderate member who sits across from me, a member elected in 1990, a long time ago— today he looks exactly the way he did when he was elected; I don’t know how he does it. He was from Wellington back in those days. He’s always had “Wellington” in there; he’s got some other names in his riding now. I call him the member for Highway 6, because he advocates on behalf of that.", "I’m pleased to have my colleagues and others—we have some medical doctors in this particular caucus who would tell you what the detrimental impacts of burning coal were.", "We always talk about clean coal technology. It is an oxymoron to say “clean coal.” You really can’t clean coal up. You can do certain things with it, but you really can’t take out all the contaminants. I remember that even the Economist, which could never be called a left-wing magazine—certainly it would be called very business-oriented—had on the cover a number of years back a picture of coal and a detrimental headline, and the story inside described the negative impact of coal on that occasion.", "I’m pleased that I had the opportunity to bring this bill forward, I believe when I was Minister of the Environment, and other Ministers of the Environment had the opportunity to bring it forward. It’s the kind of bill I would have thought would pass very quickly in the House, but the debate has been more fulsome than anticipated. I suspect that the debate will be fairly unanimous in this regard.", "I’m hopeful that we can now move this bill to its finality, as it should be, and that we will see unanimity—something that is difficult to achieve in this House—among members of all three political parties on not only ending coal, but making sure that in the future it would be extremely difficult to reinitiate the use of coal in existing plants—converting—and also in new plants.", "I suspect that even the most small-c conservative members of the Conservative caucus would be in favour of this particular piece of legislation, and I encourage them very much to vote in favour of this legislation." ],

It killed virtually everything around Inco—at that time, it was called Inco. There was virtually no vegetation. Anybody who had any respiratory disease was in real trouble. You’ll remember that the space agency in the United States went to Sudbury to practise a moon landing, only because the terrain in those days was similar to what they anticipated finding on the moon.", "There’s a big difference in Sudbury today. First of all, they built a higher smokestack to send the smoke down to Sturgeon Falls. That wasn’t really satisfactory.

Of course, he had the chance later on, when the Liberals formed the government again, to again serve as the Minister of the Environment.", "We are talking about environmental legislation, so I want to talk about an important environmental issue in my riding. It was an issue that I brought to the attention of the Minister of the Environment of the day, the member for St. Catharines, about a year and a half ago, working with the Environmental Commissioner, suggesting that there needed to be more done to ensure the safe disposal of compromised soil. I have a number of communities in my riding where landowners are receiving a substantial number of truckloads of what we would call compromised soil. It was explained to me that there are various degrees of degradation of soil. Really, what we need, I think, is greater action on the part of the provincial government and the leadership to assist municipalities to ensure this soil is being disposed of safely. Bringing this to the attention of the minister through the Environmental Bill of Rights mechanism, I was pleased that the Minister of the Environment, the member for St. Catharines, did, in fact, agree that there needed to be a review of the policy. He told me at that time that there were provincial guidelines, best-practice guidelines that had been recommended by the ministry, and we were pleased that he agreed to the review.", "I was told at that time that it would take 12 to 18 months, I think, to complete the review.

But certainly we are looking forward to the response from the ministry.", "As to my constituents, they were pleased that the review was being launched, but the trucks continue to bring the fill, and have continued to do so over the last 18 months.

In those days, in many cases, members of the Legislature were involved in participating as chairs of government commissions like that. Mr. Root was a leader in terms of environmental protection.

I know that Margaret was very persistent and advocated for that for many years. It’s true that it was our government in 2002, and the Minister of the Environment of the day, Elizabeth Witmer, who actually agreed to proceed and ensured that the appropriate action was taken.", "I think the Lakeview generating plant was probably the most polluting coal-burning plant in the province at that time. Actually, Elizabeth was given credit by the Ontario Clean Air Alliance for her leadership in this area. I believe it was in 2001 that the minister “issued a legally binding regulation requiring the phase-out of coal burning at the Lakeview generating station in Mississauga by April 2005. In September 2002, when Ernie Eves was Premier, the government of Ontario adopted the goal of phasing-out the province’s four remaining coal-fired power plants by 2015. In August 2007 the McGuinty government issued a legally binding regulation requiring the complete phase-out of coal burning by December 31, 2014.”", "Of course, as the member for St. Catharines mentioned, I think there has been an emerging consensus in this Legislature amongst all three political parties that we needed to move towards the phase-out of coal. But I also remember the election campaign in 2003 quite vividly. Our party was in government; we were seeking re-election. Right off the bat we had trouble during the election campaign. Those of us who had been around for a while knew that it was going to be a difficult challenge for the government to be re-elected but we carried on, of course. I remember quite vividly the Liberal Party taking the position that they would phase out the coal-fired generating plants by 2007.", "I remember the discussion that took place in our caucus after that, although I can’t divulge exactly what was said—caucus confidentiality—but certainly we had a number of conversations about it. We were advised that the technical experts who knew all about this issue—who worked for the government—had advised the government that it would be technically impossible to close the coal-fired plants by 2007. It was absolutely impossible. It would not be in the public interest to try to do so. However, the Liberal Party, then in opposition and seeking to be elected in 2003, had this as their party policy.", "I remember the Liberal candidate who contested my seat in the riding of Waterloo–Wellington, at the all-candidates meeting in Elmira, getting a great overwhelming endorsement of applause by her supporters who were in the room when she promised and committed to close all the coal-fired plants by 2007. I don’t know how many votes turned to support the Liberals on that particular issue, but as we all know, it was impossible to close the coal-fired generating plants by 2007. Before long the government acknowledged that that was the case.", "We, of course, on our side of the House pointed that out as a broken promise. As you recall, Mr. Speaker, we were pointing that out quite frequently—that a number of promises had been broken in the first few years of the McGuinty government. It seemed that the promise to close the coal-fired plants by 2007 was broken, and it was broken again because another date had been set. In the end, it took until 2014-2015—roughly what we were told at the time in that caucus meeting that I recall quite vividly.", "I think it’s important that all of us be responsible with our election promises. I point that out to remind all of us that we have to demonstrate integrity in terms of election promises so as to be deserving and earning of the public trust.", "I know that Elizabeth Witmer, as Minister of the Environment, was very passionate about this. She wanted to proceed with the policy. It was also well known to us that approximately half of the air pollution in Ontario was not generated in Ontario. It was coming from, primarily, I think, coal-burning in the United States.", "Really, we knew that if we took this step it would make a substantial difference in terms of the quality of the air that we breathe in Ontario, but to assume that it was going to solve the problem, that we could do it by ourselves—because of the natural geography of the North American continent, obviously that would not be the case.", "I know that some felt that if we closed our coal-burning plants, then we would somehow have the moral authority to go to the American jurisdictions and challenge them to do the same and then they would do it. Well, of course, as we know, I don’t think that it’s going to work that way, or that it has worked that way. But, at the same time, we have, I think, taken the proper steps in Ontario to close our coal-burning plants.", "The member for St. Catharines talked about the importance of conservation. As a Progressive Conservative, I believe in conservation, too. I don’t know why we as individuals or as companies in the marketplace or governments—why any of us would want to waste anything. Certainly conservation of our natural resources, conservation of our electricity, conservation of all of our resources should be a high priority for all of us. I believe that’s a Progressive Conservative value. I think that, certainly, we need to take greater steps to encourage conservation.", "Now, I want to get back to the bill. As we know, “The bill amends the Environmental Protection Act by adding a new Part VI.1. Section 59.2 prohibits the use of coal to generate electricity at certain specified generation facilities after December 31, 2014.” Of course, that was last December. “The greater fines set out in subsections 187(4) and (5) of the act apply in respect of a conviction for breach of the prohibition....”", "“Section 59.3 generally prohibits the use of coal at generation facilities to generate electricity after December 31, 2014. This prohibition does not apply in respect of two types of generation facilities. One type is a generation facility at a facility that produces a product other than electricity or steam where the generation of electricity is not the primary purpose of the facility. The other type is a generation facility that uses heat, steam or by-product gas from another facility that produces a product other than electricity or steam where the generation of electricity is not the primary purpose of the other facility.", "“The power to make regulations exempting any person or thing from any provision of the act does not apply to a generation facility that uses coal to generate electricity unless the facility is of a type that is similar to the type that is exempted under section 59.3.”", "Well, what does all that mean? Again, in essence, they are prohibiting the use of coal to generate electricity in the province of Ontario.", "Our caucus has expressed support for the principle of this bill, and when the vote takes place I hope to be here to support the bill at second reading. But I also think it’s important that the bill be sent to committee and that we give the public an opportunity to participate in public hearings. I think, generally speaking, our legislation is improved by the public process that takes place at standing committees. It’s important that groups that have perhaps advocated for this for years would be given the opportunity to express their ideas and, in some cases, perhaps, suggestions for amendments. All of that is part of the process, and it allows for us to ensure that the legislation—that we get it right and that, in fact, it is legislation that will stand up under the test of time. I would think that that would be an important part of this.", "The summary of the bill: The bill bans the burning of coal at power generating stations in Ontario by the end of 2014, as I said earlier. If passed, Bill 9 gives the government the ability to impose heavy fines on any person or company that burns coal at a power plant for the purpose of generating power after the end of 2014.", "Of course, I think that it’s very unlikely that those measures will be necessary, that those penalties will ever be transacted. I suspect there will be a high degree of observance of the law when and if this bill is passed in some form.", "Of course, again, exceptions are made for facilities that produce “a product other than electricity or steam where the generation of electricity is not the primary purpose” and facilities that use “heat, steam or by-product gas” from said facilities.", "Some of the issues that our caucus has raised about this issue that I think need to be restated in the context of this debate: We have said that Bill 9 doesn’t address how to reduce private sector coal use. Reducing this source of coal pollution represents a real opportunity to clean up Ontario’s air.

But obviously, if the government has made some steps in that direction, we’d be interested in learning more about their plans.", "The term “alternative fuels” refers to types of non-recyclable materials like shingles and certain plastics which could be used as a fuel source when making cement.", "I want to talk about power plant conversions for a minute. Bill 9 sets out no plans to convert existing coal plants into natural gas or biomass facilities. We have said that the Liberals appear not to have an idea as to how to balance growing our economy and protecting the environment. Any serious piece of legislation would have addressed how to preserve jobs by converting coal plants into natural gas and biomass power generating stations, like the former Auditor General recommended.", "We’ve also said that phasing out coal started with a regulation, as I said before, issued by former Progressive Conservative Environment Minister Elizabeth Witmer to shut down the Lakeview generating station.

I think it’s a great thing that the Premier of Quebec is coming here. I think it’s going to be an important addition to the discussions that we’ll have in the next few weeks.

Obviously, I believe that’s in the public interest.", "I know the government is quite proud of their commitment to enter into this cap-and-trade arrangement with the province of Quebec and the state of California, but we have a lot of concerns about it because we believe it will drive up the cost of doing business in the province of Ontario; there’s no question about that. If we’re going to maintain an effective manufacturing capability in the province, we have to be paying attention to the various competitive pressures that our manufacturers face on a whole range of issues. In my current role as critic to the Minister of Economic Development and Trade—we talk about this all the time—we have lost something like 300,000 manufacturing jobs in recent years, something that I was highlighting and bringing to the attention of the Legislature going back to, I think, 2005, even before the recession, because I was hearing from manufacturers, especially with the strengthening Canadian dollar at that time, that they were going to be facing real challenges. In fact, we’ve seen the hollowing out of our manufacturing sector.", "Our provincial policy has to be able to, as a goal, find the balance that protects the environment while at the same time allowing our industries to compete successfully and to be able to create the jobs that we need. Manufacturing traditionally has been a source of good-paying—in many cases very-good-paying—middle-class jobs. The jobs that have been created in recent years, post recession, in many cases do not pay at the same average rate. For example, we lost an important employer in our community, the A.O. Smith plant, where the workers were making a good wage. The jobs that are being created in the service industry, Tim Hortons, for example—obviously those jobs exist, but the people who are being asked to take them are not being paid at the same level.", "Unfortunately, I’ve run out of time and I recognize that you’re ready to call for questions and comments, Mr. Speaker.

There is no science on fracking yet.", "In fact, a year ago this week, the Globe and Mail ran a headline: “Go Slow on Fracking, Scientists Warn.” The article, by Shawn McCarthy and Ivan Semeniuk, started like this: “Canadians face a Pandora’s box of potential environmental and health risks as the oil industry charges forward with hydraulic fracturing techniques that are needed to unlock vast natural gas and oil deposits across the country, says a new report for the federal government.”", "The report was commissioned way back in 2011, when former environmental minister Peter Kent was there. He wanted to know the impacts of shale gas development in Canada. The independent experts who did the study concluded that development needed to go slow so science could catch up to the impacts that are being documented.", "Speaker, it just seems to me that when we talk about getting rid of coal-burning plants or putting a ban on fracturing, we do it for future generations, at least when the science is known; until the science is known, we have to go slow.", "Thank you for your time, Speaker." ],

Something on the order of the equivalent of the pollution of two million cars has been removed by virtue of the annihilation and annulment of coal-fired gas plants. We’re talking about an extraordinary benefit to human health, animal health, plant health; for example, the provocations of asthma. We know that something on the order of 500 Canadians, unfortunately, still die of asthma; there are two million unscheduled urgent care visits because of asthma. And whether it’s concentration of pollution, concentration of populations—and, of course, all that means in terms of particulate matter, carbon pollution, industrial pollution—this affects the lungs. These particles come into our systems. They sit; they simmer; they cook; they percolate. This, of course, is an added reason for not only asthma and COPD but also downstream development of things like cancer and, as we call the group of illnesses, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.", "These are very real issues, Speaker, and I’m very proud to be part of the Premier McGuinty government, the Premier Wynne government and counting, to help eliminate this massive yet avoidable input into human health.

I just want to say thank you for your experience and institutional memory, because when those members stand and speak about something, we actually learn something about our own history. It’s difficult to find out, really, in many ways, about Ontario’s history in this Legislature without that. We really should do better on teaching in our educational institutions about our history.", "For example, I didn’t know that it was Elizabeth Witmer who closed a coal-fired plant. I found that very interesting. Again, you learn here.", "What we’re dealing with here, of course, is Bill 9. It’s kind of an after-the-fact bill, because the coal-fired plants have been closed. I listened, of course, with interest, also, to the member from Etobicoke North when he was talking about the health effects, and there’s nothing more true than that. Certainly asthma rates are through the roof. I remember, as a young parent who, at that point, was living in the Beach area of Toronto with my children, that it seemed like every second child in that classroom was on a puffer of some sort. We know how devastating and, in fact, fatal that disease can be. Again, it’s directly attributable to what you’re breathing in.", "Way, way back in the day—in fact, everybody probably in this Legislature can point to the time when they became socially active or politically active, and what that issue was. Certainly for me the issue was the environment. I remember as a teenager watching a phenomenal CBC documentary, a really, really interesting documentary. Back in those days, they didn’t talk about climate change—they didn’t use those words—but they did talk about pollution and they did talk about the state of our water, the state of our air, the state of our earth, and the fact that this planet has finite resources and an ever-expanding population. We also, of course, have an economic system that’s forever growing. It’s growing and it needs to grow, and it’s consuming, and we’re consuming those resources at greater and greater rates per person, year to year to year.", "You don’t have to be a rocket scientist, as they say, to figure out that something has got to give, that we cannot continue to consume the way we have over generations and generations of human life on this planet and still have a planet that we can pass on to our children.

I mean every generation, of course, was, but now we have the information.", "I would hope it’s impossible, certainly in this chamber, to deny that climate change is real and caused by humans. Certainly I hope in this chamber some sure facts about the environment are absolutely incontrovertible. The question is: What are we going to do with those facts? We are the generation, we are the legislators who sit right now—federally, provincially, in the States and everywhere in the world—that are charged with doing something about it. If we don’t, we pass on, really, quite a cataclysm for our children.", "I remember going down to the States and attending a Council of State Governments conference where one of the speakers was speaking about the fact that extreme weather events used to happen now and then—maybe even per generation, that have some devastating extreme weather event. Now in the States they’re preparing, in terms of a budget, for one a month—one a month. Think about the toll of that on our economy. Think about the toll of that on human life. Think about the flooding just in Toronto that happens in our basements. Think about the winter we just went through, the extreme summers that we get, the kind of weather that is just genuinely weird, that people haven’t seen before, that we’re seeing now routinely around the world. This is what we’re talking about when we’re talking about the environment.", "We’re also talking about running out of those finite resources. The theory always was that technology would get to the point—some of us are old enough to remember the Jetsons. You remember the idea that in some halcyon future we’d all be flying around, we could get out of here, we’d be travelling? If we pollute this planet, there are other planets. Surely, there is life on Mars; we’ll be setting up colonies. All of that—apart from those who go to ComiCon—it’s not so real anymore. What is real is, we’re stuck here. This is all we have. If we don’t look after it and pass it on to our children, we have nothing; absolutely nothing.", "Right now, I have constituents in my riding, many of them elderly, who are renters who pay more for their hydro every month than they do for their rent. They’re on fixed incomes and they can’t afford it anymore. We won’t get into the privatization of hydro, which of course, as you know, we virulently oppose and will consistently in the New Democratic Party, but one of the reasons for that is the huge cost overruns for a nuclear industry—the refurbishments at Darlington etc. are what you’re paying for when you’re getting that bill.", "We heard today in question period the member from Toronto–Danforth talk about the side effects of that industry, and the side effects—apart from the Fukushimas of the world, which of course are shocking and devastating—are the production of nuclear waste. Today, we heard that that nuclear waste is going to be buried next to one of our Great Lakes. We heard that the only environmental assessment that could be done on it is federal. We know that the federal government has gutted the environmental assessment process. Think about it. This is in the member from Huron–Bruce’s riding. This is going to happen in her riding, next to one of her lakes. This is prime territory, and we know that nothing will ever happen to that nuclear waste. It doesn’t go away. It doesn’t dissolve. We don’t have an answer to that. We have no answer to that, other than to bury it. This is not an environmental answer. So there is a classic case in point.", "To return to the bill, the bill, of course, about banning coal—a good thing. I hearken back to the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke and others who have mentioned it—yes, I too was elected in 2006 and I remember the promise: 2007, then 2011, then 2014. I remember it was always sometime in the future, never quite now. It’s good that it finally got done, I have to say. It’s good that it finally got done; good that the bill prevents it from ever recurring. That’s a good thing.", "One of the ugly secrets about our friends in Europe is the continuing use of coal, even in countries that have moved to renewables at an incredible rate. Even countries in Europe that are using renewables are still using coal—an ugly little secret about power in Europe. I think we have to take credit in this province: We don’t have that ugly little secret anymore.", "Is there more to be done? Oh, my goodness, yes. One of our members just mentioned Gord Miller, the Environmental Commissioner. I want to give a shout-out to Gord Miller, who is retiring out of his job, a phenomenal Environmental Commissioner who has done phenomenal work. He’s done it for many, many years, and I want to point to some of that work, where some of the promises of this government are concerned.", "We forget that at the same time that the government promised to phase out coal, they also committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 6% below 1990 levels. That was also a concomitant promise back then. And that was to 166 megatonnes. That’s a lot. Think about it: One megatonne is equal to a million tonnes. So below 1990 levels by 2020, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. In July 2014, Gord Miller, that selfsame Environmental Commissioner, reported that while the government was projected to meet its 2014 emissions targets, it will not even come close to meeting its 2020 targets. Apart from closing the coal plants, he said, “Very little has been achieved ... in fact, we have gone backwards.”", "In September 2014, the government released its most recent greenhouse gas projections, which weren’t available to the Environmental Commissioner when he wrote his report. The situation has improved somewhat, and now the government is projected to exceed its greenhouse gas targets by 19 megatonnes instead of 28 megatonnes. What this still means, Mr. Speaker, is that in 2020 Ontario will exceed target emissions by more megatonnes than all the greenhouse gas reductions achieved in the electricity sector since 1990, even with all the coal plant closures.", "You know what? I’m going to repeat that, because I know there are lots of side conversations going on, but I know that the people watching at home, particularly those who are really interested in climate change and the environment, will pay attention to the salient fact, the critical fact. This deal means that in 2020 Ontario will exceed target emissions by more megatonnes than all the greenhouse gas reductions achieved in the electricity sector since 1990, even with all the coal plant closures. This is a problem. This is a problem, and we need to do something about it. We need to do something about it.", "In May 2014, the amount of carbon dioxide in the air exceeded the symbolic milestone of 400 parts per million, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This is a level that has not been seen in—get this—800,000 years. In 2012, the world emitted a record 34.5 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. Coal was the largest contributor to that, but of course there are others. So we’ve got a problem. We still have a problem. We still have a problem that needs immediate attention.", "Let’s talk about some of the aspects of that. There are small stories among big stories here. I mentioned the burying of nuclear waste. That is a story ongoing. That’s something we could do something about. We could weigh in with an environmental assessment.", "NoJetsTO—a big issue in my riding and a big issue among all the lakefront ridings and others—it should be a big issue for all of us—about putting jets at the Toronto airport. Again, the province owns the lakebed. That’s part of it. The province could do an environmental assessment. We have called for that environmental assessment. So has NoJetsTO. The answer we get is that this is federal only. It’s not federal only. We have a vested stake in this in Ontario. We should be doing all we can.", "Listen, I don’t know about anybody else in this Legislature, but we, among others, in the New Democratic Party do not trust Stephen Harper and his government where environmental issues are concerned. We cannot pass the buck and say, “Leave it to the feds,” because we know the feds are doing nothing about it. In fact, they’re moving backwards. They are moving backwards, and there’s no question about that.", "Meanwhile, this is going on literally in our own backyard, in our own province. These are issues that are happening here. These are issues we should be out in front of, we should be doing something about, we should be calling for an environmental assessment on. That’s what we should do.", "In my own riding, with the Union Pearson Express, believe me, our phones are ringing off the hook. It’s now running every 15 minutes, 24/7, right through Liberty Village, right past the backyards of those who live in my riding, past parks, past schools. Not my riding alone—Laura Albanese in York South–Weston. There are a number of ridings that it’s running through—Trinity–Spadina and others. It’s going to be running on diesel. No jurisdiction in the world is investing in diesel trains except for Bangladesh and us. What are we doing? This is in our own backyard.", "By the way, it’s not a relief route for those who want to use it to get downtown. No. It’s just airport and back, at exorbitant rates that very few can afford. That will be a white elephant, mark my words, and we will be paying for that as taxpayers: paying to pollute.", "What can we do? These are local issues. These are provincial issues that we could do something about. It’s extremely important.", "Today I was happy to see that the member from Toronto–Danforth’s anti-fracking bill passed, because, like this bill—very much like this bill, in a sense—what he’s attempting to do is to prevent fracking from being part of the Ontario provincial scene. That’s a very good thing. The argument, “Well, it’s not happening yet,” to me, doesn’t hold water, literally water that will be polluted by fracking. It doesn’t work, because the reality is that it could happen here. As long as it could happen—and it shouldn’t happen—we can act to prevent it from happening. That’s what we’re tasked with as legislators. Again, I can’t emphasize how important this is.", "From my teenage years to now, looking at the world, looking at Canada and looking at us, I can say that we have failed miserably. My generation, we—most of us boomers in this place—have failed miserably to protect the planet and to also protect future generations who want to live on this planet. We’ve failed. So it’s tasked to us that we start doing something, and “everything” is the answer to what we should be doing, as much as we can.", "To get back, again: Is this bill good? Absolutely, it’s good. It points to something that has been done, something good that’s been done. We hoped it would have been done earlier. Originally it was supposed to be 2007, then 2011, but finally it is done. That’s a good thing. That’s a start. It’s a start.", "One of the members in the Conservative Party talked about cap-and-trade. We are looking forward to hearing the details about said cap-and-trade, because honestly, to this day, I haven’t seen those details. Let’s see the details; let’s see the action. My goodness, that’s the call upon us from every environmentalist: Let’s see the action. Our children and their children and their children’s children will look back at this generation, at this Legislature, at the one in Ottawa and ones in jurisdictions around the world, and say, “What did you do?” Because if we don’t do it, it may be too late. As I say, if you want a depressing evening, spend it with an environmentalist talking about the environment and climate change. That will really depress you.", "Here’s the big picture, and here’s another fact that one should really take home: In 2010, global leaders attended the UN Cancun Climate Change Conference and agreed to limit global warming to two degrees. This commitment included a pledge to reduce carbon emissions below a specified target.", "In November 2014, a UN report noted that Canada was one of only four countries, along with Australia, Mexico and the United States, that is not on track to meeting their emissions reductions. We should be ashamed, as Canadians, about this.

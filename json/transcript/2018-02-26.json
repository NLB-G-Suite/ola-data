  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to rise in the House today to initiate second reading debate for the proposed Fairness in Procurement Act, 2018. I would have preferred to be standing in my place in this House last week. Unfortunately, I was somewhat delayed in giving this speech because the official opposition, distracted with some messy infighting, has allowed their internal struggles to impact the work in this House—important work on behalf of the people in Ontario and on behalf of Ontario workers and their families. Instead, they have chosen to delay the debate with procedural tricks and obstructionist delays. However, here we are, and we’re glad to be here now. I contrast that with those of us on this side of the House. We are continuing our focus and our intentional work on debating what’s important to Ontarians—our work on their behalf—because they share our priority; namely, protecting Ontario businesses and made-in-Ontario jobs.", "There has been a resurgence of late in calls for Buy American policies in the United States and at the sub-national, or state, level. Our government is quite concerned with these restrictive policies, which could prevent Ontario-based businesses from participating in certain state government procurement contracts.", "Des pratiques d’approvisionnement équitables, ouvertes et concurrentielles sont avantageuses pour tous, de part et d’autre de la frontière. L’accès aux marchés publics crée des emplois et augmente la valeur pour les contribuables.", "Last year, New York state put a Buy American provision in its budget. The proposed rules were extremely punitive to Ontario and would have given New York businesses an unfair advantage. Premier Wynne took decisive action and has been proactive in directing her team to work hard to find a diplomatic solution. Some of the most senior ministers in this government went to Albany last year to lobby against this policy and to work proactively and productively to change it.", "While we worked through diplomatic channels, Premier Wynne made it very clear that if New York went ahead, there would be consequences. Why, Speaker? Because in every good relationship there is a clear understanding of boundaries and expectations. In fact, it is a common premise that clarity on both sides enhances relationships. So we were very clear from the beginning about our priority: protecting the interests of Ontario companies and workers from potentially punitive decisions. Put simply, Speaker, that’s our job. Under the Premier’s leadership, we are doing just that.", "Initially, New York was receptive; they scaled back the bill. But since that time, they have passed another Buy American bill, a bill that would punish Ontario businesses and Ontario workers. We’ve responded with this proposed legislation that we are discussing today, using fairness as our guiding principle. The Fairness in Procurement Act enables us to bring in responsive regulations to respond in proportion to states that aren’t treating our businesses and our workers fairly.", "The New York Buy American Act was signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo on December 15, 2017. This legislation could prevent Ontario iron from being supplied for public works contracts over $1 million for surface roads or bridges. If Ontario is not exempted from this legislation, the requirements could take effect on April 1, 2018. We have told our US partners that the protectionist road they are going down is not in the interests of either their businesses or ours, and we have made the point that we believe in free and fair trade.", "We in Ontario know that open borders and co-operation with our neighbours make us more competitive, and when we are more competitive, we can create more good jobs for our workers. In 2015-16, nearly $160 million worth of Ontario government contracts went to New York state businesses. This is about government procurement, Speaker, not trade. I want to emphasize that point.", "Nous parlons de marchés publics, et pas d’échanges commerciaux.", "Right now in Ontario, we are investing an historic $190 billion to build up our roads, our schools, our hospitals—writ large, our infrastructure. Jurisdictions around the world are watching, dare I say with admiration, as Ontario plays “catch up to keep up” after years of underinvestment, whether it be in our hydroelectric infrastructure, our roads, our bridges or our hospitals—including, I am proud to say, the brand new Joseph Brant Hospital in Burlington—all investments that are creating jobs and growing our economy.", "That’s what is at stake for New York—their ability to participate in our enormous efforts to build infrastructure and create jobs here at home. Premier Wynne and our team have worked diligently through diplomatic channels to find a resolution. She has personally met with 33 state governors. She has met with congresspeople, senators and members of the US federal administration. Two weeks ago in Washington, she met with members of the House ways and means committee, the US chief negotiator on NAFTA, and the vice-president’s chief economist.", "We’ve had these conversations, but it doesn’t end there. We need to make sure we have the tools at hand to act quickly to protect Ontario jobs if we need to. That’s why our government is proposing legislation to provide Ontario with the capacity and the ability to take measured actions in response to discriminatory procurement practices implemented by US states. It is the right and responsible thing to do as the largest subnational in the country.", "Le gouvernement propose une loi qui habilitera l’Ontario à prendre des mesures proportionnées en réponse aux politiques d’approvisionnement discriminatoires des États américains.", "The US has a lengthy history of imposing Buy American policies nationally and at the state level. The previous administration included Buy American policies in its 2009 stimulus package, and certain US Department of Transportation agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Transit Administration, require US steel and manufactured products to be used in certain projects.", "Ontario has played an instrumental role in previous federal-provincial-territorial efforts to counteract Buy American policies. This has resulted in Ontario gaining permanent access to procurement in many states—an important win for Ontario businesses and workers.", "The new US administration’s support for Buy American has placed much more emphasis on these policies at a state level, which is what we are now experiencing in Texas and in New York state. Buy American proposals are also being considered in other states, including Maine and New Jersey. So proportional responses are a very important way of being very intentional about our priority: protecting Ontario business interests and Ontario jobs.", "Mr. Speaker, our close relationship with many US states is measured beyond the value of goods and services that flow between our borders. It is a relationship that relies on its deeply intertwined economies. Take Michigan: We build cars together. That’s how our auto sector is able to compete with the world and support hundreds of thousands of jobs. As the daughter of an auto worker and someone who worked in the Chrysler minivan plant growing up in Windsor, I understand and appreciate both the contribution of our auto sector to our economy and the importance of those jobs to Ontario workers and their families. As the MPP for Burlington, I have a number of companies in my riding that are part of the automotive supply chain, as advanced manufacturers.", "Speaker, our government understands the importance of these relationships to the economy and to our workers. As a consequence, Premier Wynne has met with Governor Rick Snyder and signed two memoranda of understanding, or MOUs, to increase collaboration in our auto sector. Last summer, as a result of that MOU, we completed North America’s first cross-border autonomous vehicle trip, from Detroit to Windsor to Traverse City, Michigan.", "During this time of uncertainty and rising protectionist sentiment, Ontario is working together with our American friends to take the auto sector into the 21st century. We are showing that we are stronger together, and we are building the kind of partnerships that we’ll need to weather the storms ahead.", "Let’s get back to Ontario and New York state: When it comes to our economies, both benefit enormously from a strong and integrated partnership that supports good jobs on both sides of the border.", "Un solide partenariat intégré entre l’Ontario et l’État de New York est extrêmement bénéfique pour les économies des deux territoires et maintient de bons emplois des deux côtés de la frontière.", "Open access to other markets is key for job creation and growth for Ontario. Our government will continue to advocate in this regard, emphasizing to our partners south of the border the importance of reciprocal access to government procurement projects, and actively advocate for an exemption from other Buy American policies that may be proposed in the future. In the absence of any legislative means to address Buy American policies, these New York-based suppliers, and many more, could continue to access Ontario government procurements while Ontario-based suppliers could be shut out of the New York state marketplace unless they use US-made steel and iron. So it’s clear there is a lot riding on our relationship with New York state, not to mention all of the other US subnational jurisdictions that could follow their lead by implementing similar Buy American policies.", "Mr. Speaker, the success of Ontario’s economy, both now and in the future, is deeply intertwined with that of our US neighbour. In fact, this inextricable relationship sets the context for taking decisive and appropriate steps to ensure the relationship’s success. We believe that joint participation in one another’s procurement processes helps our citizens on both sides of the border to live better lives. We can and should have better access to the best companies have to offer.", "At a time when advancements in technology are blurring borders and creating a global economy, it does not make any sense to regress into a world of protectionist philosophy. And so it is with some reluctance that we take these steps. And in a moment I will speak to the degree to which our legislative course of action is widely supported by important sectors and actors in the Ontario economy.", "As a consequence of recent developments, our government cannot and will not stand idly by and have Ontario businesses discriminated against. While we do not think it is optimal, we want the world to know we are ready and we are willing to respond in kind. This is the right and the just thing to do, and it underscores the fact that we are fully committed to standing up for Ontario workers and Ontario businesses.", "As I’ve said earlier, over the past year our government has stepped up its efforts to ensure that US state leaders understand Ontario’s concerns. To that end, Premier Wynne, Minister of Economic Development and Growth Steven Del Duca and Minister of International Trade Michael Chan have been actively meeting with officials in states that either already have Buy American provisions—for example, New York state and Texas—or are considering them.", "We’ve heard some unreasonable criticism from the opposition, saying that they wouldn’t go this far to support Ontario businesses. They’ve suggested that we should try talking to our southern neighbours. Speaker, this would suggest that they have not been paying attention to the focused and determined actions of Ontario ministers and our Premier, meeting with American subnational leaders to discuss issues of mutual interest and concern; namely, the important free trade and procurement practices between our two jurisdictions. I can assure this House and Ontario workers, however, that while the opposition may be otherwise distracted, our sense of purpose is very clear.", "To be fair, the opposition has been distracted with other things recently, but that’s why I’m pleased to remind our colleagues opposite of the leadership and hard work that have gone into this government’s relationship with our American neighbours as we continue our work on these critical relationships. I am pleased to remind those of us who might be otherwise focused of the 33 governors whom Premier Wynne has met with, and the countless other meetings that have taken place and will continue to take place.", "The temporary Leader of the Opposition is a veteran when it comes to not supporting Ontario workers. He has bragged about his letter-writing campaign back in 2009, when the US first introduced Buy American provisions. We all know that the world has dramatically changed since then, both politically and economically. While the interim leader would choose to send a quick letter and hope for the best, our government will fight for Ontario workers every single time.", "Indeed, working together with our partners, we will continue our advocacy efforts in New York state in the lead-up to April 1, when the Buy American legislation comes into force. But in the meantime, our government is taking steps to protect our province’s economic interests now precisely because that’s what leadership is: discerning the appropriate actions and then acting in our province’s best interests. That’s what leadership is.", "When there are restrictions that inhibit or prevent Ontario businesses from participating or succeeding in public procurement, our government is seeking the authority, through the House, to respond proportionately through the proposed Fairness in Procurement Act, 2018.", "If passed, the proposed legislation would allow Ontario to take measured action to respond to discriminatory procurement practices. Through the proposed legislation, the government hopes to discourage similar Buy American policies from US subnational jurisdictions, both at the state and local level.", "Avec la loi proposée, le gouvernement espère décourager des politiques « Buy American » semblables émanant d’administrations américaines de compétence internationale, tant au niveau de l’État qu’au niveau local.", "The responsive legislation would be limited to the offending state, so it would not target suppliers from other jurisdictions and it would focus on procurement. It is designed to discourage other US subnational jurisdictions, both at the state and local level, from considering similar Buy American provisions.", "If passed, the proposed legislation would give Ontario the flexibility to choose whether and how to respond to these actions by providing the authority to make regulations. These responsive regulations, if made, could be pursued, in instances where a US jurisdiction enacts legislation or adopts a discriminatory policy that may inhibit or prevent Ontario suppliers from participating or succeeding in procurement processes initiated by purchasers from the offending US jurisdiction, and provide specific parameters for action.", "In terms of how the process could work, once it became clear that a US jurisdiction would be implementing a policy that, in the minister’s opinion, may inhibit or prevent an Ontario supplier from participating or succeeding in procurement processes initiated by purchasers in the offending US jurisdiction, a responsive regulation could be developed.", "As President of the Treasury Board, I would then provide cabinet with details such as:", "—the specific US subnational policy and how it could impact Ontario;", "—the kinds of reciprocal measures the government would be considering;", "—the entities to which the regulation would apply;", "—the date the regulation would take effect; and", "—how the government would communicate its intent to revoke the regulation should the offending jurisdiction remove its policy or provide Ontario suppliers with an exemption.", "This important analysis allows us to respond proportionately and sensibly to a given circumstance.", "Once the regulation is in force, prescribed Ontario entities would begin following the established procurement measures, which may include excluding companies from offending American subnational jurisdictions from competing on certain procurements.", "The regulation could also be revoked in the event that the jurisdiction in question removed its protectionist policy or provided Ontario suppliers with an exemption.", "The responsive regulations, if made, could apply to a range of Ontario government and broader public sector entities, such as ministries, hospitals or universities. At a high level, impacted provincial government entities could include ministries, provincial agencies, the Independent Electricity System Operator and Ontario Power Generation Inc. and each of its subsidiaries. Affected broader public sector entities could include public hospitals, school boards, colleges and universities, and group purchasing organizations.", "The proposed legislation would allow the government to add other entities through regulation as seen fit. This means that, should a responsive regulation be developed, the government could prescribe other entities as appropriate.", "It is important to note that the proposed legislation would not establish any obligations on the impacted entities until such time as a responsive regulation was established.", "The proposed legislation would establish the authority to create regulations that could allow for exemptions in certain cases. Procuring entities in Ontario could receive a waiver from the restrictions imposed in the regulation. Should a broader public sector, or BPS, entity enter into a contract that contravenes the legislation or a responsive regulation, the proposed legislation provides that the contract would be void unless the minister responsible validates it. Specific sanctions for BPS entities that contravene the legislation or regulation could also be included in responsive regulations.", "Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that this is not about trade; this is about government procurement. As I mentioned, the proposed legislation is enabling and does not establish any obligations.", "It is also important to note that while the proposed legislation would provide the government with the ability to act, it would not require it to do so. On its own, the legislation wouldn’t functionally do anything unless we decided to take action under it.", "We remain optimistic that constructive discussion can continue to deepen the relationship we have with our closest neighbours. However, having the proposed legislation in place will support and ensure the fair treatment of Ontario businesses and Ontario workers. In fact, Ontario’s procurement policy framework promotes value for money through the application of competitive processes that are open, fair and transparent.", "On average, the government of Ontario does business with 52,000 vendors annually. Strong requirements are built into the policy framework to promote integrity in our procurement processes. These include mandatory policy requirements to express procurement specifications in generic and functional terms, to remove bias against or for any vendor; mandatory disclosure requirements, including disclosure of evaluation methodology, to support fair, open and transparent procurements; and a formal bid dispute process so that vendor concerns about procurement processes and contract award decisions can be addressed in an open and transparent way.", "It is clear that openness, transparency and, most importantly, equality are at the heart of our government’s procurement framework.", "To be very clear, we do not want to escalate this matter. We only want what is fair. This legislation allows us to create a fair playing field by mirroring whatever discriminatory practices are applied by our US neighbours, should it become necessary to do so.", "Speaker, our colleagues on the other side of the House must be feeling a little lonely these days as they work to delay this important legislation and delay our efforts to protect Ontario businesses and Ontario jobs, because that is not a position that is broadly supported. I say this because we’ve had important partners to our government, key stakeholders, voice their support for these efforts. They include Dennis Darby, president and CEO of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, who said:", "“CME is pleased the government of Ontario is standing up for Ontario’s manufacturers by introducing retaliatory measures to unfair procurement practices.", "“We wish that this kind of legislation wasn’t necessary between two countries with such a long history of trade and co-operation like the US and Canada.", "“But too often US federal and state governments enact or threaten to enact measures to block our manufacturers from exporting goods and services into their procurement markets.", "“It is also a critical reminder of how important it is that government procurement issues are dealt with in the ongoing NAFTA renegotiations.”", "And this from Jerry Dias, Unifor national president:", "“Managing public procurement in a way that bolsters local economic development is an important policy tool for governments, at all levels.", "“But the federal and state administrators in the US have perfected the art of abusing those tools, effectively closing off Canadian suppliers from entire projects—especially in iron and steel.", "“Ontario’s bold move today sends an important message that strengthening cross-border relations cannot be a one-way street.”", "Here’s what the Provincial Building and Construction Trades Council of Ontario had to say:", "“Ontario workers need a government that will stand up for them against discriminatory practices.", "“Fighting for a level playing field will allow our province’s economy to grow and create the jobs of the future. The Fairness in Procurement Act is a step in the right direction.”", "Kalyan Ghosh, the CEO of Algoma, said this:", "“Algoma is a strong advocate of free and fair trade.", "“As the North American steel industry is highly integrated, open and competitive access is in the best interest of all businesses and communities across the supply chain.”", "Todd Letts, the CEO of the Brampton Board of Trade, said:", "“Ontario requires flexibility for responsive action to American protectionist policies.", "“The Brampton Board of Trade advises caution and proportional response. Protectionism costs everyone—in New York, Texas and Ontario.", "“Consumers and taxpayers on both sides of the border end up paying more for public construction projects like roads and bridges, when bids are compromised by protectionist policy. There are no winners in trade disputes.”", "And Christian Provenzano, the mayor of Sault Ste. Marie, said:", "“It is important that the province of Ontario takes this measure to protect Ontario’s industry from unfair or discriminatory procurement practices.", "“It is important to recognize that such practices can have very negative consequences for communities like Sault Ste. Marie. While US steel comes over the border and is used here on a daily basis, Canadian steel shouldn’t be prejudiced. If it is, our government has to be in a position to respond.”", "And another, this time from the Whitby Chamber of Commerce: “Anything that could restrict our members’ access to different markets is concerning. That’s why the Whitby Chamber of Commerce welcomes the government’s proposed Fairness in Procurement Act. This kind of legislation may encourage all parties to keep the trade doors open, which will benefit businesses on both sides of the border.”", "As you can see, Mr. Speaker, this proposed legislation is broadly supported by key stakeholders across this province, both employers and workers alike. So I’m not sure what the PC Party will have to say to those people and those organizations about why they felt it was reasonable and appropriate to block this Legislature’s efforts to protect them.", "Mr. Speaker, I’ll conclude by reiterating that the government of Ontario is committed to maintaining fair and accessible procurement practices. We will continue to lobby for an exemption to New York state’s policy in order to strengthen and promote Ontario’s long-standing business relationships. Defending the interests of Ontario businesses operating in other markets is part of Ontario’s plan to create jobs, grow its economy and help people in their everyday lives.", "Défendre les intérêts des entreprises de l’Ontario qui exercent des activités dans d’autres marchés fait partie de notre plan visant à créer des emplois, à stimuler notre économie et à améliorer la vie quotidienne de notre population.", "Speaker, our plan is working. With the fastest-growing economy in the G7 and the lowest unemployment rates in 17 years, under the leadership of our Premier, Kathleen Wynne, Ontario is not only open for business, but jurisdictions around the world know it too, which is why Ontario is the leading jurisdiction in North America in terms of foreign direct investment.", "As the saying goes, “Good things grow in Ontario,” and we intend to ensure that they continue to do so. And so our government will continue to advocate on behalf of Ontario workers and businesses and seek ways to strengthen and promote our long-standing business relationship.", "Le gouvernement continuera de défendre les intérêts des travailleurs et des entreprises de l’Ontario et de trouver des moyens de renforcer et promouvoir nos relations commerciales de longue date.", "We believe the proposed legislation sends a strong signal about our government’s commitment to defending the interests of Ontario businesses and Ontario workers operating in other markets.", "I encourage all members of this House to support this important legislation.

I suspect this is more about politics than anything else.", "What I’m hearing in my riding certainly is that business needs to be supported. There’s a huge lack, as was mentioned by my colleague, of skilled workers. I know companies like Connor Industries in Parry Sound, which builds Stanley aluminum boats—world-class boats shipped all over the world—that’s one of their biggest challenges: finding welders and that kind of thing.", "I attended, last Thursday, the Ontario Stone, Sand and Gravel Association annual meeting that was held at Deerhurst Resort in Muskoka. Over the course of their evening, that was a huge issue for them as well.", "I think we need to support Ontario business. We need to put in policies that are going to make our businesses competitive. We’ve seen policies like high electricity rates and more and more regulations and red tape making it really challenging for businesses to compete. I think we need to support those businesses; I just don’t see any benefit from this bill other than it’s going to escalate and make more of a trade war out of what’s going on." ],

It is a response which is precisely proportionate to the Buy American legislation that a state or a municipality has already put in place.", "To be totally clear, Speaker, the way this bill works is that if a state government puts in place Buy American legislation that prevents Ontario manufacturers, Ontario producers and Ontario businesses from selling things to that state and to that state government when it goes to buy IT or infrastructure, that if a state has already done that, Ontario would have the ability to respond in exactly the same way.", "This is not an escalation. This is simply saying that if, for example, a US state says that you can never buy steel from a plant in Hamilton or a plant in Sault Ste. Marie, we would be able to say, “Do you know what? You, Ontario person, who is using Ontario taxpayers’ money to build infrastructure, can’t buy steel from that state.” That’s how this bill would work." ],

But as the member from Guelph mentioned, this is all about procurement and not about trade. I think there’s an important difference in those two things.", "While members opposite have referenced issues like escalation—the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka, who talked about how we need to apply caution. We agree. This is not about escalation, for that very reason. This is about a proportional response, Speaker. It’s important that we keep these things in mind.", "There are no winners in trade disputes, as I mentioned in my remarks.

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to be able to join the debate today, on behalf of my amazing riding of Huron–Bruce and on behalf of the PC caucus and our party, to speak to this particular government legislation.", "The act respecting fairness in procurement is a response to the recent anti-trade sentiment and laws we have seen south of the border. We agree that it is important that we take all reasonable steps to keep Ontario’s businesses competitive and to make sure Ontario’s businesses have fair access to markets all over the world, but I would like to ask the government an important question right out of the gate: Why are we debating this bill right now? If you were expecting New York to implement their legislation for the past year, why did we not pursue this legislation last fall? In fact, we know that 10 months ago, in April 2017, your cabinet met to discuss a bill that would allow the government to hand down its proportional response to states implementing Buy American laws, but it took 10 months for the bill to be tabled, coincidentally—or not so coincidentally—right before an election.", "Now, the Premier tried to pin last week’s reasoned amendment as an inappropriate tactic, but I want to talk about that, Speaker. Let’s take a look at the facts. This is the reality we deal with as the loyal opposition.", "Fact number 1: The government did not reach out to my office—not once—to discuss their bill. They did not indicate that they wanted to work with the opposition, and not once in the 10 months since they had taken this bill to cabinet last spring did they even mention a word of a briefing. Now, we’re not shocked by this behaviour, but we would like to call a spade a spade.", "Next, the government indicated on February 6 that they would be tabling the bill within two weeks. Immediately, I instructed my office to reach out for a briefing or at least an embargoed draft copy of the bill. We did not receive our draft copy of the bill until February 20. Ladies and gentlemen, that was just minutes before it was tabled; and then we received our briefing the next morning, just hours ahead of the leadoff debates.", "The government said they are willing to work with us on trade but, really and truly, their actions are speaking so much more strongly than words. They have no intent in working with any of us on the opposition side of this House. The fact that they would not allow us to do our due diligence on the bill indicates their unwillingness to include us in the discussion at all.", "The Premier claims to want to work with all parties to pass this legislation, but as I mentioned just moments ago, actions speak louder than words, and through their actions we have seen no willingness of government to co-operate with any party in the House.", "In the 10 months since the Premier’s cabinet met and contemplated this legislation and the day it was tabled, we heard absolutely nothing. So I would just like to recommend that in the future, should the government wish to debate a bill a day after it is tabled, perhaps share a draft of the bill with us and give us a briefing ahead of time. To me, that constitutes wanting to work together. This would allow us in opposition to ask the important questions ahead of time and could have prevented our reasoned amendment last week. And that reasoned amendment contained an incredibly valid question that the government has yet to answer, and that question is, why? Why is this legislation needed?", "What is currently stopping the government of the day in their authority to procure goods and services from directing government entities and broader public sector entities to select bidders that reflect preferences on trade and procurement? We are still waiting, Speaker, for a satisfactory answer.", "In fact, the Auditor General’s report from 2017 reminded us that Infrastructure Ontario was not tracking how many vendors bid on capital projects and which vendors were winning the bids. In fact, Speaker, Infrastructure Ontario—and I quote from the auditor’s report—“allowed its external project managers to select vendors from its vendor-of-record list and manually add them to the list of bidders.” Some 321 projects worth $49 million were selected this way.", "If managers can hand-pick vendors, why can’t the government just tell these managers to exclude New York-based vendors when they do their hand-picking next time? We still do not know why this issue actually needs legislation.", "But let’s get to their supposed justification for this bill. The government believes it will ensure that Ontario businesses remain competitive. Really? There’s so much we can talk about in that regard, but right now, let’s talk about what the government has chosen not to prioritize in terms of Ontario businesses and helping them to be competitive. They have done the exact opposite. For the past 15 years, the competitiveness of Ontario businesses has been compromised by reckless policy after reckless policy by this Liberal government. This is particularly acute in the manufacturing sector and with small business.", "Where do we begin, Speaker? There is such a huge list, but let’s start with what is still topical and a number one topic of conversation throughout Ontario: electricity. We have seen electricity prices go through the roof. We have seen Bill 148 and its provisions that many businesses claimed would hurt their ability to compete, and we have seen countless policies from this government that make life more unaffordable for employers and employees, draining resources from our economy. Over the past 15 years, Ontario has lost its competitive advantage to the United States, and the Wynne team and their policies are responsible for this.", "In fact, we just need to look back to the 2018 Ontario Economic Report from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, which was released this month. Speaker, in it you will find some disturbing trends. For example, 77% of Ontario businesses say that access to talent has an impact on their competitiveness. For instance, time and again, Speaker, I have stood in this House talking about the concern that Ontario’s agri-food industry has. The gap in terms of jobs waiting for graduates once was three to one, but just this past fall it was recognized that there are now four jobs for every graduate in the agri-food industry. We have a serious concern on our hands.", "Another example of how this province is turning a blind eye and causing our Ontario businesses to be uncompetitive is that 67% of small businesses surveyed said that red tape and the cost of navigating regulation factors into their competitiveness. Another 63% cited the cost of electricity as a major impediment to their competitiveness.", "Speaker, just the other day, 62% of Ontario Chamber of Commerce members were reported as being worried about the provincial economy. Why is the government not worried?", "The Canadian Federation of Independent Business spoke to an environment of “frustration and despair.”", "In the government’s 15 years of power, they have not yet addressed the much more important issue of competitiveness. We have seen this government take limited action to actually alleviate the skills gap in Ontario. We have yet to see meaningful action in lowering electricity prices from this government. Speaker, this government has failed to rein in the excessive red tape dogging businesses from one corner of the province to the other, but when the low-hanging fruit comes along—a Buy American bill—they are more than willing to claim they are champions for businesses across Ontario. And Ontarians are not buying it.", "This government uses a common tactic. We’ve seen it time and again from embattled politicians around the world.", "When policies cause economic harm, embattled governments find an outside enemy in a flailing attempt to gain votes. In other words, Bill 94—I’ll repeat myself and correct my record: Bill 194—is just a distraction. It’s not what Ontarians deserve, Speaker. As I mentioned in my leadoff question this morning, Bill 194 is merely reckless politics. I’ll repeat that: Bill 194 is just reckless politics and absolutely not good public policy.", "In fact, this could even be pointless public policy. Chapter 10 of NAFTA directly references subnational procurement. In fact, since NAFTA was originally agreed to, the Obama administration and the Harper government also reached an agreement on subnational procurement on a smaller scale. This is why we are party to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement.", "NAFTA is currently being renegotiated, and this topic could be raised again. So I ask: Why are we debating this right now, when those negotiations are ongoing? Have we not seen and learned from the rhetoric coming from the United States and the negativity that it has generated? This government is merely choosing to be provocative and to risk further retaliation for the sake of this Premier’s desire to score cheap political points.", "We have been told that this will be a proportional response, or that we will respond in kind. But we have seen no evidence that this will be a requirement under the legislation. It is important to note, for those watching this debate on Bill 194 right now, that a threshold that limits government’s response is completely missing from this bill. Again, like time and time before, we see legislation get rushed and they get it wrong. This government gets it wrong so many times.", "Imagine for a moment what would happen if a government that was against trade was elected in Ontario and given the authority to retaliate with no limit written into the law. Speaker, I don’t know about you, but to me and many Ontarians—in fact, the majority of Ontarians—we see that as a recipe for disaster.", "I invite government members to read the bill if you haven’t already done so—and everyone else in the House, for that matter. Read as well the government releases associated with Bill 194. The omission of thresholds is a glaring flaw that is right there in the open.", "In her press release, we found the Premier’s perspective on a potential threshold for retaliation against an American state. It reads: “The Premier has consistently said that she will respond to any Buy American laws that cause unfair harm to Ontario workers and businesses.”", "The bill, in fact, reads: “The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations designating an American jurisdiction as an offending American jurisdiction if, in the minister’s opinion, the government of the American jurisdiction has enacted legislation or ... measures that may inhibit or prevent Ontario suppliers from participating or succeeding in procurement processes.”", "This bill is left entirely to the whims of this Premier and her cabinet. Right now, Ontarians are rightfully wondering, “What existing legislation will this apply to south of the border?” If the government was serious—as they purport to be—on protectionist trade, they might have dealt with this far earlier than just a couple of months before an election.", "Right now, I would like to take a pause and thank the legislative library for helping me track down many examples of just what is going to be talked about in the days ahead as we debate this legislation with regard to procurement.", "We’re going to take a trip around the United States, ladies and gentlemen. Let’s start with Alabama—Alabama, whose 1965 law mandates that local vendors must be used for the oils, fuels and lubricants required for state highways and bridges. That has been in place, as I mentioned, since 1965, and I can’t help but wonder if the minister, the Premier, or a future minister, for that matter, will take a measured and proportional response to Alabama on this law. Speaker, what do you think? Do you think they’re really going to do that?", "Did you know that in Alaska, Speaker, only Alaskan timber, lumber and manufactured wood products are allowed to be used in state-funded construction projects? This law has been on the books since 1949. I again ask: Will the minister be taking a proportional and measured response to this particular law?", "I hope you’re seeing a trend here, but I’ve only got two. There are 48 more to go, or a few more than that.", "Alaska also requires a 7% preference for Alaskan agricultural products for all state school board purchases. I question whether the government truly has the time to take a measured response against Alaska as well.", "In Arkansas, the official state flag must be manufactured in the United States. Some might think that this is a smaller example, but does the government plan on taking a proportional and measured response here as well?", "Speaker, my tongue is in my cheek when I say this: I bet that the minister’s BlackBerry is already blowing up due to all of the regulations he’s going to be writing.", "Here’s another: Since the Second World War, California has held a 5% preference on California-manufactured goods in public work contracts and has mandated the use of US-produced manufactured material in public contracts. California also gives preference to US-grown and -processed foods in public entity purchasing.", "This government is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to California under their cap-and-trade scheme. Again, this particular Liberal government is choosing to send hundreds of millions of Ontario dollars to California under the cap-and-trade scheme, yet here we have several protectionist measures on the books. I question: Will the Premier and her government take action against these laws as well?", "Let’s go on to Colorado. Colorado gives preference to Colorado-grown, -raised and -processed agricultural goods. Florida mandates that all state and American flags purchased by the state must use American-made materials and be American-made.", "I’m only partway through my list here, but I would just like to emphasize that the Premier said that she would “respond to any Buy American laws that cause unfair harm to Ontario workers and businesses.”", "I might suggest, from my small list that I just shared moments ago, that this government really has their work cut out for them if they’re going to walk their talk in this particular bill.", "Moving on, we’re going to go on to Georgia here. Georgia mandates the inclusion of a clause in state contracts that stipulates that contractors must use Georgia forest products in construction, repair and renovation projects. Georgia also reinforces a general preference on supplies, materials, equipment and agricultural products that are manufactured or produced in Georgia. Speaker, isn’t that peachy? How is the government going to attack that one?", "Hawaii applies for a preference for Hawaiian-grown, -manufactured or -processed products which varies from 10% to 15%, depending on the class of product. This one is relatively recent, having been on the books since 1994.", "Illinois has several protectionist state statutes on the books. For example, in 1998, they implemented a general preference for Illinois agricultural products and plastic products made from Illinois corn by-products. Illinois also has a provision in every public works contract that mandates the use of steel products that are manufactured or produced in the United States. Does this one sound familiar?", "Again, I ask whether this government plans on actually taking action against all states that have protectionist measures on the books.", "Still keeping with Illinois, they mandate preferential purchase on materials and supplies that have been manufactured in the United States.", "Indiana has similar rules that mandate that governmental bodies adopt rules to promote the purchase of US-manufactured supplies. Indiana also has rules that mandate that domestic steel products be used in state products. Indiana applies a 10% preference as well to agricultural products grown, produced or processed in Indiana.", "Kentucky mandates that state agencies must purchase Kentucky-grown products.", "Louisiana applies a 10% preference for steel rolled in Louisiana. Louisiana also applies a 10% preference to all agricultural, forestry, meat, eggs and seafood products that have been manufactured, processed or assembled in Louisiana.", "Maryland applies a 10% preference for locally grown food in all state school and facility contracts. Maryland also mandates that all public bodies require contractors to use or supply American-manufactured goods in public works. Lastly, it mandates that all public bodies use or supply American steel products in public works when purchasing large machinery.", "Here’s a good one, Speaker. I have a gentleman in my office who loves the Blue Jays, and he’s very excited that spring training just started last weekend. We all know that that means baseball season is right around the corner.", "Guess what, Speaker? Minnesota requires American-made steel in the construction of ballparks. Exactly how is the Premier going to make Minnesota play ball with her? We have to be real here.", "Missouri requires purchasing preference to all commodities manufactured, mined, processed, produced or grown in Missouri. Missouri also applies a 10% preference when public agencies purchase or lease domestically manufactured goods and commodities for contracts greater than $25,000.", "New Hampshire mandates that state and American flags purchased by the state must be manufactured in the United States.", "New Mexico applies a preference to materials produced, grown, processed or manufactured in New Mexico for all public works contracts. New Mexico also mandates that the timber used in the construction and repair of public buildings must be grown in New Mexico.", "In a moment, I’m going to talk about New York.", "So, Speaker, why are we all here today? It’s because of what’s happening in New York. New York has mandated domestically produced steel in certain construction contracts. But as we have seen, this is not the first protectionist legislation to deal with iron and steel. It’s just the first to draw a political response from a desperate Premier right here in Ontario.", "Moving on, let’s talk about North Carolina. North Carolina gives preference to products manufactured or produced in North Carolina for state contracts, and gives preference to products and services manufactured or produced in the United States in the case that North Carolina products cannot be sourced.", "Ohio applies a preference to products mined or produced in America. Ohio also restricts meat or poultry contracts to bidders who are under either federal or Ohio jurisdiction.", "Oklahoma applies preferences to materials mined, quarried, manufactured or procured in Oklahoma for the construction of public buildings. Oklahoma also applies a 2.5% preference for US-manufactured or -produced goods and equipment for state contracts.", "Oregon has a general preference for goods and services that are manufactured or produced in Oregon, and that state also applies a 10% preference to goods that are fabricated and processed in Oregon for all public contracts.", "Pennsylvania mandates that public agency procurement contracts include a provision stipulating that only domestic steel products can be used.", "Rhode Island also applies a similar stipulation on domestic steel. They also direct purchasing agents to buy Rhode Island foodstuffs for state institutions.", "South Dakota prohibits the purchase of foreign meat food products by any purchasing agency.", "Tennessee mandates a preference for in-state meat producers when state departments and agencies award food contracts. Tennessee also applies a general preference for goods and products grown in Tennessee in all state department or agency procurement.", "Don’t worry, Speaker. I’m almost done going through the states.", "Let’s talk about the Longhorn State now: Texas. They give preference to goods produced or grown in Texas for all state agency purchases. They also mandate domestic iron and steel in water supply projects, and require that, for certain projects, only US-made iron and steel products can be used.", "Utah offers reciprocal preference to bidders offering products that are produced, manufactured, mined or grown in Utah.", "West Virginia mandates the use of domestic steel in any state construction project, as well as domestically produced aluminum, glass and steel in public works contracts over $50,000.", "Wisconsin applies a general preference for materials mined, produced, fabricated, assembled or manufactured in the United States.", "And for today, for the purposes of this debate—lastly, Wyoming applies a 5% preference for Wyoming-grown, -manufactured and -produced materials in all public purchases.", "If the government didn’t have the time or the interest to consult with the opposition parties and stakeholders, or to write a bill that’s more than five pages, how on earth will they have time to deal with all of these regulations that will address the issue at hand, and what they claim to be doing through Bill 194? Quite frankly, it’s just, again, politics over good policy.", "Speaker, let’s recap right now. I just listed off 50-plus Buy American laws on the books at the state level in the United States, eight of which are very similar to the Buy American provision that we are currently fighting against and one of which brings us to this debate today. So I will again call into question the exact intentions of this government, suddenly bringing in a new protectionist procurement law three months before an election.", "Nineteen of these measures were enacted during the government’s time in office. Have they only just realized recently that American states have protectionist policies on the books? No, Speaker; we must give the Wynne Liberals a little more credit than that. The reason for this legislation is plain and simple: This is a reckless election ploy aimed at finding an alternative villain. This legislation aims to connect the competitive disadvantage of Ontario firms with outside forces rather than the Wynne Liberals accepting responsibility for their own disastrous economic policies. Again, only now, Speaker, are we seeing a bill, just a couple of months before an election. I can’t help but think that this timeline is truly the reason behind the bill and nothing more.", "Now that we have gotten through all of the American examples—examples that the government of the day, namely the Liberals, chose not to respond to—let’s talk about this government’s own habit of bringing in their own protectionist rules and actually making Americans retaliate against us.", "The Ontario government broadened measures that didn’t quite pass the WTO sniff test when it came to fair business practices. There were significant trade issues with the Liberals’ Green Energy Act. Does everybody remember what has gone on over the last couple of years? This disastrous policy came into effect in 2009, and it’s the main driver behind the doubling of Ontario’s hydro bills over the past decade.", "Although it is infamous for that main fact, there was another key fact that this government overlooked, but again, it was knee-jerk policy that has always caused this government to overlook the realities of how their bad policies affect Ontarians. Talking about the Green Energy Act, this law had a 60% made-in-Ontario content requirement for the wind and solar projects that we were about to overpay for. This protectionist requirement led Japan and several third parties, which included the United States and the European Union, to file a complaint with the WTO.", "A Toronto Star article from 2012 warned that the WTO was likely to rule against Ontario, and guess what? The Wynne Liberal government ignored the warnings. The headline in the article read, “Siemens Canada Says It’s Not Abandoning Ontario Even If a Trade Ruling on Green Energy Rules Goes Against the Province.”", "In 2013, the WTO ruled that the domestic-content provisions were discriminatory against foreign firms, and guess what? They were removed.", "Sure enough, last summer Siemens—surprise, surprise—closed its Tillsonburg plant, which cost the town 340 jobs. So this Liberal government hasn’t been perfect on the trade file either. In fact, this government has been guilty of writing laws that ultimately were ruled to have contravened WTO rules. Even worse: Because this Wynne Liberal government failed to recognize that their own policy was in fact protectionist, they failed to act. As a consequence, 340 people lost their jobs in Tillsonburg.", "Interjections." ],

With this legislation, the Wynne Liberals argue that they are standing up for Ontario’s manufacturers. But this doesn’t match the facts.", "We have heard time after time in this House about the loss of over 300,000 manufacturing jobs in the province. We have seen factory after factory close and leave our ridings for other jurisdictions. We have seen policy after policy cripple the viability and the competitiveness of Ontario businesses. We have seen report after report from the Auditor General chronicling the misuse of taxpayer funds and the disregard for Ontario’s economy. So Ontarians must ask, why Bill 194 now? Why now have the Wynne Liberals suddenly taken an interest in Ontario manufacturing? Again, this is a constant theme. It’s politics, not good public policy.", "The Liberals will claim that manufacturing is suffering worldwide, but this is simply not the case. According to Stats Canada, many provinces have seen a growth in manufacturing jobs since the recession. In fact, with the exception of Quebec, Ontario has the poorest manufacturing job numbers since the recession.", "According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, there has been tremendous growth in manufacturing south of the border. States like Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Ohio, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming have all seen job growth in their manufacturing sectors. But what about the Great Lakes region? The manufacturing engine was hit hard by the recession.", "It has been noted many times in this House that over 300,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in this province. However, this is almost the same amount of manufacturing jobs that have been gained in Great Lakes states since the recession. Can we find the common thread here, Speaker? A huge number of manufacturing jobs have been created in Minnesota, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin.", "For goodness’ sake, just last week I received an email that was forwarded to me by a Huron–Bruce manufacturer from Vermont. Vermont was telling this manufacturer why he should come down to their state and see why doing business in their state would be so much better than in Ontario. Again, Premier Wynne has done a good job in being the best economic development officer the States have ever seen.", "Where was this government’s concern when new jobs were being created around Canada and across the United States but not in Ontario? Where was their concern when their high electricity prices were compromising Ontario jobs? Where were this Wynne Liberal government’s concerns when factories were closing in Ontario? Let’s dive a little deeper and examine this whole situation.", "This legislation would supposedly address steel protectionism from New York. As you know, manufacturing is an energy-intensive industry. Behind paper, steel is the second most intensive sector for electricity. Now, is it any wonder that the two sectors with the largest loss in real GDP were paper and steel? As the Liberal electricity prices skyrocketed, jobs and growth in the steel and paper industries plummeted. Between 2005 and 2015, Ontario lost almost one third of its total jobs in paper manufacturing. During that same time period, imports in paper manufacturing increased by 169%. What’s wrong with that picture?", "Again, between 2005 and 2015, this Liberal government let the real GDP of that sector shrink by a quarter and allowed the employment in the sector to shrink also by a quarter.

This reeks of electioneering at its worst.", "Now let’s talk about the bill itself, because even if the government’s intentions are cynical, perhaps there is merit to the bill.", "To start, as I have established, Ontarians are likely wondering which states will be targeted and what form this retaliation will take. Usually we might find this defined in the legislation, but again, this legislation is only five pages in depth. There’s a problem. This bill is small; it’s about the length of my Sunday crossword. Why so small? Because this is enabling legislation that leaves so much up to regulation.", "You know what that means: A lot of decisions will be made behind closed doors, and because of that, Ontarians should be very anxious. That means no transparency and no consultation. And who enacts all these regulations? The President of the Treasury Board and the Premier, along with their cabinet.", "What could go wrong behind closed doors? Well, once again, do we dare even start going down that list? We’ll just say that the Green Energy Act really encapsulates all that can go wrong in that regard.", "In question period this morning, the President of the Treasury Board claimed that this bill addresses an “absence of a coherent, cohesive response to what is happening south of the border.” The only legislation lacking coherence and cohesion is the Liberals’ own policy. Rather than consult with the rest of the Legislature and with Ontarians, this legislation empowers the Liberal backrooms to proceed as they see fit. What could go wrong?", "This is brazen—this from the people who brought us high electricity prices; this from the people who brought us eHealth, Ornge and the gas plants scandal; this from the people who have stood idly by while 300,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared. Again I ask: What could go wrong?", "The lack of consultation has been an absolute trademark of the Wynne Liberal government, and the lack of transparency is so concerning. The focus on backroom decision-making is also concerning. Let me be very clear: The backroom decision-making has been a choice the Wynne Liberal government has made. They are choosing to take debate away from us in the House by working through regulations behind closed doors and taking transparency and openness completely away from Ontarians.", "Let’s take a look at the text of the bill. It actually says in Bill 194 that consultation is an option, not a duty. Again, I repeat this: Bill 194 says consultation is an option, not a duty.

Uncertainty is the worst thing for Ontario, the worst thing for Ontario communities and the worst thing for jobs.

And now, thanks to this last-ditch election ploy, we have uncertainty about contracts and the future flow of cross-border trade.", "When the Premier says that she is “not in the business of harming Ontario businesses,” honestly, Speaker, we have to ask her, what does she really mean by saying this? Does she think the opposition and the people of Ontario have been asleep for the past month, let alone for the last 15 years? By stoking the embers of protectionism, the Premier risks a potential trade war. If we’re not careful, she could send the remaining manufacturing jobs up in smoke.", "Yet again, this government has signalled to Ontarians, time and again, that winning an election is more important to them than standing up for Ontarians.", "Over 100 years ago, on February 21, 1911, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce began. It was then, as it is today, a collection of businesses interested in helping Ontario’s economy to prosper. Their opening mandate was to remove barriers to trade. Again back in 1911, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, when it began, had an opening mandate to remove barriers of trade and to foster the free flow of goods while, as the Globe noted, “to leave politics behind.” If only our government could take a page out of the chamber’s history book.", "The provincial economy and the livelihood of Ontarians is something that should not be used as an election pawn. It is disgraceful that this government is attempting to use this legislation as a way to get re-elected. They are looking to lay the blame for our economy on the USA. Again, this desperate, out-of-tricks government is looking to lay to blame for the current state of our economy on the USA, but we already know who is to blame for the current status of Ontario’s economy.", "Now, on the question of this bill, we must ask ourselves as legislators whether this bill is worthy of our support, and a bill that restricts the free flow of goods clearly is not worthy of our support. A bill that does not define limits or sets thresholds is short-sighted and, again, not worthy of our support. Finally, a bill that risks harming our relationship with our neighbours is most definitely not a bill worth pursuing." ],

At that point, what had happened was that several dairy farmers—I believe, in Wisconsin; I can’t remember the exact state—had lost their contract to a dairy exporting into Canada. As a result, the President aimed directly at Canada’s supply management system, which we all support.", "The supply management system in Canada is local food, before local food was cool. We protect dairy farmers, we protect farmers to make sure that we are assured of fresh food grown under our rules and regulations.", "The President blamed the loss of that contract on supply management, and that was not the case. That was not the case.", "What happens in the United States: They don’t pool their milk, like we do in Canada. For those who don’t know what milk pooling is, in Canada—and it happens all the time when a processor will gain or lose a contract. If your local processor loses a contract, then because the milk is pooled, you don’t lose your market. Every dairy farmer in the country loses a decimal of the market. As a result, the market is buffered and individual farmers are buffered. They don’t do that in the United States. There’s a lot of things they don’t do in the milk market because they don’t have supply management.", "When they lost that contract, I believe 70 or 80 dairy farmers lost their ability to sell their milk. Milk is a perishable product. You can’t just tell the cows not to give milk; the milk is going to come. As a result, those farmers were thrown into turmoil. That issue was used to convince the President of the United States that our system was the cause of that. Our system, the supply management system, was not the cause of those farmers losing that contract, but no one in the press figured that out. The people who were opposed to supply management didn’t bother clarifying, and it was used as a tool to directly impact our system.", "I know, talking to farmers in my area—and farmers across the province, but certainly farmers in my area—it made them very, very nervous, because they are always having to defend supply management. The reason they’ve always had to defend supply management is that it’s a good system. If it was a bad system, nobody would be trying to break into it. It’s a good system. But that’s a case of how something that was misrepresented caused—it could have caused, and it might still be causing—collateral damage, because we are still in NAFTA negotiations. These negotiations are much different than anything we have seen before. They’re much less predictable; the American administration is much less predictable. We think it’s a negotiating tactic. It’s a negotiating tactic that President Trump, before he was President, used very effectively to grow his business, and he’s doing the same thing with his administration to gain an advantage for his country.", "Nevertheless, it’s a very tense time to be putting forward anything this broad, this wide-ranging and this close to the end of the government’s own mandate. It’s incredibly suspect and incredibly dangerous. That’s one example.", "The second example about collateral damage and how this government—I’ll give you an example of how this government has passed legislation in the past where they never took trade or international agreements into account.", "Some of you may know that the reason that people lobbied me to run is because of a prospective landfill in what is now my riding, the Adams mine landfill, which at the time was to be the biggest landfill in North America. As president of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, I, along with many other people, spent 15 years fighting it. As a result, in this Legislature, a bill was passed, the Adams mine landfill act. No, it wasn’t the Adams mine landfill act; it was the Adams Mine Lake Act. That’s what it was called. Under the Adams Mine Lake Act, that site will never be used as a landfill, which everyone in northern Ontario was happy about. I actually was opposed to it and spoke against it at the committee hearing for the following reason: The Adams mine is a fully licensed landfill. The licence was never taken away. The licence was granted under, first, the Conservative government under Mr. Harris and was upheld by the McGuinty Liberals. And then, through public pressure, they passed legislation. Because the licence was never revoked, the taxpayers of Ontario paid all the investors all their costs—which I agree with. It was a licensed site, and the government said, “Even though it’s licensed, you can’t use it.” The taxpayers coughed up the money to pay all the investors.", "There’s only one investor who refused the money. He was an American gentleman, and he refused the money because he had a licence—he kept his share; actually, he bought the whole site. He took the Canadian government to the WTO, because he had a licensed landfill and the Ontario government was withdrawing and not allowing him to use his licensed landfill to the benefit of his company. He took the Canadian government to the WTO. A lot of people don’t know this. The hearing was held in Vancouver. Before the hearing, the Canadian government spent a lot of money defending the Ontario government’s decision. They actually sent a whole team of hydrogeologists and lawyers to Timiskaming to interview us. The lead hydrogeologist, in an interview with the federation of agriculture, of which I was still president, asked me what the closest farm was to the site. I said, “Well”—I forget how many kilometres, eight kilometres. I said, “But why, if it’s not going to leak? According to the Ontario government, it’s a fully approved landfill and it’s not going to leak.” The hydrogeologist from the government of Canada said, “At this point, we all know it’s going to leak like a sieve.” Yet, it was fully approved by the Ontario government.", "If the Ontario government had done what they should have done and withdrawn the approval, it never would have gone to the WTO. But the Ontario government took the political way out, and that’s why I’m questioning this again. They made the political decision to create the Adams Mine Lake Act as opposed to—and that’s why I spoke against this act—taking the actual time to find out how a site got approved that was not going to work. How did that happen? They didn’t do that. They took the political decision. As a result, they forced the Canadian government to spend, I believe, millions of dollars to defend in a WTO action.", "So Speaker, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that the government takes political action to benefit, and to avoid doing the right thing. It’s not beyond the realm of possibility for this government. It certainly wasn’t with the Adams Mine Lake Act.", "Again, the member from the opposition mentioned the Green Energy Act. We supported the Green Energy Act. I’m going to come clean on that—it was before I was here—we supported the Green Energy Act. The problem with the Green Energy Act is that the government decided—again, they didn’t look at the collateral damage that could have been possible—to promote green energy so that the green energy plants would be built here and turbine plants would be built here.

We’re paying eight cents a kilowatt.”", "A lot of my friends—and I don’t blame them a bit—went and got those contracts, because the government issued them. If you recall, when other countries, other jurisdictions, challenged the government, and now you don’t have to have 60% Ontario material in the projects, that was spun as the government negotiating a better price for the energy. Again, Speaker, that was politically motivated, as opposed to people-motivated. That’s what we have to look at here.", "When you take legislation that has been proposed—it’s the Fairness in Procurement Act, which is basically retaliatory against states with Buy American.

Yes, the Premier has now issued—I believe I read the press release—a demand that the federal government give compensation to the auto sector and supply management, but we didn’t see anything in this Legislature regarding that issue as it was going on.", "I’d like to really repeat that we are not opposed in principle to making sure that our industries are treated fairly. That’s not the issue here. The issue is whether or not we can truly believe that the government is going to use this legislation as intended. That’s the issue, because if you actually look at the legislation, in the legislation there’s no requirement that it be proportional or reciprocal. There’s no requirement for that in the legislation. So, when one of the members on the government side said, “Well, if the New York government demands that you cannot use steel from a mill in Hamilton or Sault Ste. Marie, then this legislation requires that the Ontario government will reciprocate and you will not be able to use steel from a New York steel mill,” that’s not what the legislation says.

March, April, May—yes, three months left in its mandate.", "The government is passing legislation that could be damaging for future relations, and yet there is no restriction on what could be done.", "This legislation could be very dangerous.

I myself just in the past year have attended four conferences in the United States to continue to build up those relationships. There is one conference I attend every year. I might mention that I pay my own way to go down there. This issue is very serious, Speaker. Over several years, I’ve built up what I consider those all-important relationships with state-elected—not so much federal but state-elected farmers and ranchers, those people—in central America, the south, Texas, who have benefited tremendously from NAFTA. They will say that, and Secretary of Agriculture Perdue will say and various state commissioners in agriculture will say that the benefits for the US farmer have been very significant as a result of NAFTA.", "Now we’ve got this bit of a monkey wrench being thrown into the mix. I’m not sure why the Liberals didn’t speak when their turn came up. They surely can’t have run out of things to say about this. Maybe there’s a lack of knowledge or lack of awareness of this. But to rush through what essentially seems to be a knee-jerk reaction—obviously without fulsome debate, as has just been exhibited a few minutes ago. Why are we not seeing the putting forward of a well-crafted, well-thought-out, meaningful response to these kinds of American policies that can have a significant impact on Ontario and certainly on our steel industry?", "I’m not aware of to what extent government politicians and staff have been in New York state consulting, or to what extent they’ve been negotiating, rather than to swing around and pass a law up here, passed by Ontario politicians to essentially throw something in the face of legislators and people in New York state. I think it has been said before that we in the official opposition will not support this kind of retaliation. It’s premature. It’s a very weak response and something that would not be expected of either a federal or provincial level of government.", "We all have to be aware that, given the change in administration south of the border, we in Ontario—and right across Canada—we realize we must up our game.", "On May 18 last year, US trade representative Robert Lighthizer gave notice of intent to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement—NAFTA—with Canada and Mexico. At that announcement he cited outdated standards and regulations; a fair comment that would be accurate to some extent. Lighthizer stressed the need for higher-paying jobs in the US. That was the reason given.", "The President has repeatedly stated he would tear up NAFTA. I’d like to think he has maybe modified his view somewhat there, given the feedback that he has received at the state level. To tear up NAFTA, to make a move like that, we know, would require sign-off from the US Congress. However, the US President can unilaterally sign executive orders—" ],

However, the President can unilaterally sign executive orders regarding tariffs. I’m concerned that, on occasion, President Trump has voiced displeasure about our agricultural supply management system. He has slapped new import duties on softwood lumber ranging from 3% to 24%, which obviously has an immediate and serious consequence for our all-important forestry sector.", "These kinds of moves pale in comparison to the border tax the President is touting. This would be a massive border adjustment tax, the BAT, designed solely to protect US jobs. Again, we’ve heard that. It remains unclear whether the target is strictly Asia’s parts suppliers, or whether Mexico and Canada would be dragged in. The BAT program also encompasses a proposed massive cut to the corporate tax rate, from 35% down to 15%, and includes proposals for a 15% tax rate for all businesses, lower individual rates, larger standard deductions for households and a repeal of the estate tax.", "I know recently President Trump addressed the national farm bureau, just a month or so ago. It may have been in Tennessee. Seven million farmers are members. They really welcomed, given the succession issues that we have in agriculture in North America, Trump’s proposal to get rid of the death tax. Under his plan, average US business will pay about a 20% tax rate after accounting for state taxes. We have to up our game: Canada’s average combined federal-provincial rate is in the order of 27%.", "Since last spring, the federal government and many provinces—and I recognize the work of the province of Ontario—have scrambled to put together a lobbying effort to persuade US states and the Trump administration to leave Canada out of these protectionist measures—the kind of measures the government should be debating this afternoon but doesn’t seem to be interested in talking about.", "There’s mention of the importance of our embedded, cross-border integration. Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall described it this way, as far as the cross-border supply chains: “Saskatchewan farmers buy John Deere tractors, made in Iowa, to harvest oats that are then sold to General Mills in Cedar Rapids, turned into Cheerios and exported back to Canada.”", "One of the conferences I attended earlier this year, in January, was in Kansas City. Again, I paid my own way to go down there. I convinced my wife to go on a winter holiday in Kansas and Oklahoma. I might mention we will not be doing that again. We will not be doing that next winter. The Canadian government provided lunch on one of the days at this Kansas City conference, again, to really make clear the importance of Canada and United States trade. They served hamburgers coming from cow-calf out of Alberta and finished somewhere in the United States. The meat was processed in Nebraska, the tomatoes came from Ontario and the lettuce came from Mexico. We are so integrated that any thought of any half-baked retaliation or serious battles between New York state and Ontario just flies in the face of a very good trading relationship that we have.", "In my family, my cousins run cattle in California. They bring their calves up from Mexico. I have other relatives who run cattle in eastern Oregon, and they ship to railhead down in Nevada. Again, it probably ends up in Kansas City or perhaps in Nebraska for processing.", "There’s no question the United States is Ontario’s primary destination for international exports. It represents 80.5% of the total. Those are 2015 figures. We cannot mess with that kind of relationship with any kind of ill-thought-out legislation we’re debating today.", "On the energy front, the US administration has promised cheaper energy. We know they walked away from the Paris climate change agreement. We have a cap-and-trade tax that alone puts business and industry at a $2-billion-a-year competitive disadvantage with neighbouring jurisdictions. We see policies—US-Canada policies, US-Ontario policies—going in completely opposite directions. Minimum wage, for example: You’re not seeing those kinds of minimum wages in Ontario. I know driving down to Kansas City and going through the state of Missouri, I would see the signs posted, “We compete with the state of Missouri.” Their minimum wage is $7 an hour; ours is heading towards $15.", "The ambitious attack on red tape: They talk about it as the most ambitious attack since the Reagan era, cutting regulation and capping the total cost of rules. He—referring to the President—signed an order calling on one in and two out with respect to regulation and, in some cases, dealing with the EPA and the labour department, where they have to identify two existing regulations to be scrapped, and oftentimes we see something in the order of 22 regulations being scrapped.", "So we’re messing with the world’s largest economy with this business, this law with respect to New York state. If the world’s largest economy does take off, as it appears to be, a rising tide will lift all boats, including ours in Ontario. On the other hand, if we can’t match these kinds of tax cuts and deregulation and infrastructure spending—unfortunately, the kind we’re seeing now with the Buy American rider—it could pose some serious problems for our businesses: our businesses based in the United States as well, and certainly those businesses resting on this side of the border.", "So, Speaker, in spite of Bill 194, which is being attempted here, the case truly remains for open, reciprocal trade within North America. This New York state legislation against the steel we produce and Ontario’s ill-advised proposed retaliation flies in the face of the fact that the US and Canada boast one of the largest trading relationships in the world. No other country buys more goods and services that are made in the USA than Canada, to the tune of $322 billion a year. Canada supports nine million US jobs. We have to go into this with our eyes wide open, without any thought of introducing what I consider some pretty serious legislation that may upset people on the other side of the border.", "As I’ve explained, we’re linked through just-in-time supply chains, whether it’s Cheerios, auto parts, hamburgers or steel. It is key for our tremendous advancements in investment and productivity, our competitiveness on both sides of the border, and the benefits to Mexico as well. There is more work that has to be done with Mexico as far as our system of common rules and harmonized regulation.", "When I attend these conferences and I talk to a US farmer or a US rancher, we recognize that any gains in our agribusiness/agricultural economy have been the result of trade. There are just not enough of us to eat the food or consume the products coming from the US or Ontario or Canadian farms. That kind of trade has resulted in an unprecedented growth in prosperity and, of course, the jobs that go with it.", "There are threats. In my view, the threats are from Mexico and China, whether it be steel or manufacturing. Certainly, with China and Asia, in the future we probably won’t be able to produce enough food to maintain their rapidly growing populations.", "So we see legislation that has been thrown through the window during a time of uncertainty. The negotiations commenced last August. Fortunately, the negotiations have been extended; that’s a good thing. We like to think that the negotiations do not result in throwing something out or bringing in laws to completely block steel or to completely block milk or things like that. What we need is modernization and to bring some of this stuff up to date.", "Ideally, we turn free trade into fair trade; essentially, that’s how trading relationships are supposed to work. Trade dollars flow back and forth in a fair and balanced way—not the protectionist blocking of steel at the Ontario/New York state border and the equally protectionist tactic of excluding US suppliers from participating in the procurement process.", "Speaker, there is much more to this relationship than jobs, the economy and data. The US and Canada—Ontario and New York state—have been friends and allies from, barring a few dust-ups, back to colonial times. We share a century of military history, fighting together in defence of common values: in World War I, World War II, the Cold War, the Korean War and, most recently, the Middle East and Afghanistan. Officers are embedded on both sides of the border in the army, navy and air force. We work together as two nations to look after air and water quality; 40% of our border is water.", "So Godspeed to the ongoing NAFTA negotiations. The last thing we need is any kind of ill-advised legislation coming out of the Ontario government that hasn’t been thought through that would throw a monkey wrench into these kinds of discussions, negotiations and good relationships." ],

For an example, someone mentioned that if New York isn’t going to give us steel, then we’re not going to give them steel. That’s what one of the members has said.

We say it’s a retaliation of what the States is doing.", "We also are concerned because, really, this is a federal issue.

In my view, it is because Ontario views itself and sees itself as a trade nation that it does require some ability at times to respond in a proportionate nature to measures that would have been installed to curtail trade. Indeed, the preamble of this bill is quite clear that it is not an invitation to become completely protectionist at any whim of the time. It says very specifically that it is only in the context where restrictions have been imposed on Ontario goods and services that then a minister may, if deemed appropriate, respond proportionately. The word “proportionality” is there, and that’s a very important aspect.", "It simply gives an additional leverage to ensure that there is some respect, some fairness and some credibility given to our negotiators when they are in Washington, when they are in New York, when they are talking to different governors, to say that we are serious about having good trade relationships, but we want reciprocity. We want to make sure that if you are imposing barriers there, we will do the same. So it gives a little bit of teeth to the negotiations.", "That’s the purpose of the bill. It is not an invitation to go out and be a protectionist, at any rate.

We need all the expertise that we can get, because when we have a government throwing retaliatory measures on the table, we need to stand tall.", "As the leader of our party pointed out last week, the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario does not support retaliation.

It’s painfully obvious that this has to do with nothing more than an election ploy made by an out-of-touch, out-of-ideas government. Quite simply, we need to have a government that stands tall.", "The leader of our party shared last week a letter that he got from an American colleague that dates back to his time when he was mayor of Nipissing.

If NAFTA can be truly modernized, and I feel it will, it’s going to set the stage for all concerned to expand their reach and to grow their markets, not suffocate or shrink their markets—in this case, with respect to steel.

We met in Denver. It was a meeting of the Tri-National Agricultural Accord. Again, NAFTA dominated the discussions. We knew people down there. It focused on agriculture and agribusiness. We saw a consensus where all three countries signed a communiqué—this was just a few months ago—stressing the necessity of NAFTA, calling on respective federal governments—this is why the state level and provincial level are so important—to ensure that a modernized NAFTA in this case doesn’t hurt agriculture and stressed that senior federal decision-makers maintain a legally binding dispute resolution system.

There is a framework here, but it’s not detailed. We all know what happens if you don’t know the details of something. You can certainly get into situations that you didn’t anticipate.", "There will be no healthy and democratic debate about the specifics of the measures because it’s just a framework. We are being asked to trust that the minister and the Premier will have the best interests of all Ontarians at heart in every action they contemplate under the auspices of this legislation, and that they will conduct these actions in a sensitive manner that will not provoke a trade war. That’s what they’re asking us to do as legislators, and the public at large: to trust this government.", "As I understand this bill, the cabinet “may make regulations designating an American jurisdiction as an offending American jurisdiction if ... the government of the American jurisdiction has enacted legislation or ... provided direction to ... apply requirements, restrictions, policies, sanctions or other measures that may inhibit or prevent Ontario suppliers from participating or succeeding in procurement processes....”", "Suppliers from offending American jurisdictions will be “subject to the requirements, restrictions, policies, sanctions or other measures set out in the regulations.” Again, “set out in the regulations.” We don’t know what those regulations will look like because regulations don’t come back here for debate.", "However, despite the preamble, there are no requirements in the legislation that the regulatory response to any Buy American policies be proportional or reciprocal. There is only the requirement that the regulation be retaliatory. This means that if New York state passes legislation that says they must buy US steel, Ontario would not be required to pass reciprocal legislation that the province must buy Ontario steel or cannot buy New York steel. Instead, Ontario could pass legislation saying that the province can’t buy New York pharmaceuticals or software.", "There is no requirement to act when a Buy American policy is enacted. The only real requirement is that any measures taken under the act can only be done in retaliation to a Buy American law that has been enacted or a directive that has been issued.", "Speaker, I urge the members in this House to really consider the debate that’s happening on this side. Not too often do the Conservatives talk about how they don’t want to see retaliation. They’re a party that believes in consequences to actions. Therefore, if they’re saying this is retaliatory and we’re saying it’s retaliatory, chances are, if it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, it’s a duck.", "We are debating here today, really, enabling legislation only. The substance of the act will be determined through regulations on an ad hoc basis at the whim of the minister responsible for Treasury Board. We are not really able to debate the merits of the bill, only whether or not the government of Ontario should be given the broad authority to act against a valued trading partner, and we’re being asked to do so without knowing exactly what actions are being contemplated. That’s what it is. It’s really a framework for how the government wants to set up those regulations.", "New Democrats are concerned that this antagonistic move during the NAFTA renegotiations could jeopardize the livelihoods of the people and the businesses in this province that rely on a good trading relationship with our largest trading partner, the United States, not to mention that Ontario is the only province in Canada that has started this process, under this Legislature. We have to ask why it is that Ontario is pursuing this sort of response to the Buy American campaign while, again, there’s no other jurisdiction in Canada that is doing the same.", "Given that the real potential exists to escalate a trade war that could seriously disadvantage Ontario workers and their families, we need to know that this government is proceeding cautiously and diplomatically and not just deploying a political communication strategy in advance.", "Again, we talk about a provincial election that’s just around the corner. Ontario businesses and our workers cannot be collateral damage to another desperate Liberal re-election ploy. It’s very concerning, because we know there is an election on the horizon and this government has got a lot of work to do to get the people of Ontario back on board, looking at their government as a viable party to govern. So we have to ask if this is another way of convincing people that they should be government.", "I refer to the Premier’s remarks when she stood up here in the House and talked about this legislation. There were a couple of quotes I’ve noted here. She said, “Everyone on this side of the House would have preferred for it not to come to this, but in the face of unfair discrimination we will not blink.” That sounds kind of retaliatory to me: “we will not blink.” The other one she said here was, “To be very clear, we do not want to escalate this matter.” But indeed the legislation talks about retaliatory and escalating matters if another state decides to do something they feel is not fair trade, so to speak, to Ontario.", "Ontario, again, is the only province that has taken these actions against the United States. The Liberal government should be looking to their federal counterparts, who are trade experts, where this is an issue, to handle this sensitive issue during a period of heightened protectionist rhetoric. This is about more than Liberal re-election dreams; it’s about the future of our economy.", "When I look at the fact that this is a federal issue, there are many things this government has brought forward to this House—or a couple of things, and I’ll give an example. One of them was the provincial retirement plan. It went full force on that, and we agreed with that legislation. We should have an Ontario pension plan. But we also talked about how they need to talk to the federal government and work on making this a policy decision so that it could benefit everyone as well. This government spent to the tune of, if I’m not mistaken, around $75 million on all the background work, and after all that was said and done, then there were changes federally to the pension and that was dropped.", "The other one that we’re going to talk about is pharmacare. We think pharmacare should be universal in Ontario. The government came up with a version of pharmacare, and now I understand the federal government is going to talk about a national pharmacare plan.", "So maybe reaching out to their federal partner on this is a good idea before they rush into this legislation, and having conversations with their federal MPs to bring these concerns to the table.", "Speaker, I have heard from constituents in my riding, and I’m sure we’ve all had these stories about the problems in our own local businesses. Small businesses are really the heart of our communities. They’ve been trying to compete for contracts with the government of Ontario, and whether they are trying to supply goods and services to our schools or whether they would like to engage in research and development for the Ministry of Energy, our small businesses are often stymied. If we can develop a process or a path where small businesses can actually be part of the procurement policy, that would actually help businesses to grow and thrive in Ontario and create more jobs. Our small and medium-sized businesses feel they don’t get a fair shot at our own procurement contracts. This government should be focusing on increasing opportunities for Ontario-based businesses to bid and win our own government contracts.", "For example, we shouldn’t be making changes like this government made to the vendor-of-record list for procuring external IT consultants. If you all read the Auditor General’s report, these changes made it virtually impossible for local and medium-sized IT consulting firms to get on the VOR list and paved the way for large multinational corporations to win these government contracts. Again, there are ways that we can engage our own talent here in Ontario in the IT sector. That was one example the Auditor General used.", "Another barrier to our own local small businesses in winning government contracts are the high fees associated with making a bid. Even the Auditor General, again, noted that this was a concern, as recently as 2016. You’re squeezing out small businesses that could potentially grow by having these high fees.", "I’d also like to share the views of some of the organizations that represent the views of the affected workers here in Canada.", "It’s really important that we talk about the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. I met with them today, and they talked about procurement in health care. That was the lens they were using. They want good health care in their cities and in their communities—rural, northern and urban—so that they will attract businesses and workers and have access to health care.", "They brought these things forward, and one of the topics they talked about was called “Building Healthy Communities.” I’m sure other MPPs also met with the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. They had four priorities under this heading of building healthy communities.", "The first priority: to ensure that “land use planning and development regulations are aligned to increase density and create more housing stock.” They’re talking about bringing people to their cities and communities, because they know when they’re there, they’re going to be consumers of their businesses.", "Building “adaptable and resilient infrastructure stock that can address future pressures”: They’re talking about information-gathering and how that is going to be part of what the government’s plan is to grow small business.", "“Develop a single transportation authority in the greater Toronto-Hamilton area”: Again, they’re talking about transit. It’s a very hot topic.", "Then they also talked about striking a “health cabinet to improve information-sharing and break down budget silos between ministries.” We know that we have to do a better job of communication between ministries when it comes to issues. If we don’t talk to each other, we don’t know what one or the other ministry is doing, and complementing those policies going forward would be very good.", "And then: reforming the “procurement and supply chain processes within the Ontario health care system.” That’s what they were talking about. These are local initiatives that the chamber of commerce brought forward.", "Their official quote, though, is: “Positive diplomatic relations should always be our priority when it comes to trade discussions. With the Fairness in Procurement Act, we understand that the government’s intention is to respond to barriers rather than escalate them.” That’s what their understanding is, and that’s what the Premier said: “To be very clear, we do not want to escalate this matter.”", "They go on, saying, “No other province in Canada has legislation in place that would escalate trade sanctions when they occur.", "“The Ontario Chamber of Commerce believes that the best approach for Ontario is the formation of positive bilateral co-operation with our American neighbours. This is the approach the Premier and her government have taken to date and they must continue to do so.”", "They’re very clear, as business people, how you build business relationships. If you’re putting this legislation in place, it’s not sending the message to the neighbours that you actually want to have that collaboration, that you want to have them come to the table in bilateral co-operation so both parties can benefit. That’s what they’ve said.", "I have to say that I do agree that we need to be very careful. When we engage in trade negotiations, we need to be able to trust that our leaders will take the correct actions that are in proportion to the situation and not to aggravate it, worsening relations between our countries and the lives of our workers and their families. That is not a good thing.", "Again, I point to the fact that federal negotiations are happening right now all over the world with trade. This is the opportunity we have where we can talk to our federal partners and express the uniqueness of our province. Southwestern Ontario is one of those areas that has a $1-billion industry under agri-food, and we need better procurement policies for that sector. We also have our auto sector. That’s another one where I think we need to do better when it comes to trade and procurement. We’re not exercising those policies here in our own province in order to grow those industries.", "I’m from southwestern Ontario. They are very core, important industries and sectors to a thriving London, as an example. In London, probably our number one sector right now is agriculture. We have industry and factories popping up throughout my riding, and we’re so pleased we’re able to thrive and grow that industry. Speaking for myself, Speaker, I want to know that we are procuring locally. It’s really important that I know where my food comes from. In Ontario and the country of Canada, we have really stringent legislation around food security—what comes in and the standards that we have. I think we need to really look at southwestern Ontario and those two industries and try to do better so that they can flourish.", "As leaders, we need to learn and trust fundamentally what this government’s legislation is proposing. Premier Wynne needs to strongly defend Ontario under the CPTPP; absolutely. We need to deal with making sure that it’s not just a framework when this legislation comes into place.", "Another piece I was reading when I looked at the bill—again, we didn’t get a full one-hour lead from the government. It would be nice if someone could expand on this for me, but, again, I fear it’s more of a framework rather than details in legislation. On page 2, under “Enforcement,” the topic is “Contract void.” It says, “A procurement contract entered into by a broader public sector entity is void if the procurement contract or the process by which it was entered into contravenes this act or a regulation made under this act, unless the minister by order validates it.” Again, the minister has a lot of power.", "The other piece, if you follow down page 2, under “Limitations on remedies,” under the topic of “No compensation”: “Despite any other act or law, no person is entitled to any compensation for any loss or damages, including loss of revenues or loss of profit, arising from the enactment, repeal or application of this act, the making, revocation or application of any regulation or order made under this act or anything done or not done in accordance with this act or a regulation or order made under this act.” You have no right to challenge this government for compensation should there be a problem under this act. That’s the way I’ve read it.", "There is so much to this bill. It is truly a framework, because when you see how many pages—we don’t want an omnibus bill, so it would be nice, truly, to get to the point of the bill; absolutely. There are four pages here so it is skeletal; it is a framework. I don’t know how quickly this government wants to push this bill through—because we know that we’re almost at March. We’ve got all of March and all of April and then we’re going to be shortly into an election.", "How much consultation is going to be done in committee on this bill? How much time are we going to be able to debate this bill on third reading if they’re going to rush it through? They’re not putting up speakers, so you tend to think that they want this six hours of debate to come very quickly, so they can move it on. I don’t think that is a good start to a trade bill. You’ve got to open up debate to have an understanding of where this government—what direction it is.", "But for now, what it looks like is a lot of regulation, a lot of framework, and nobody really knows the details of what this bill means. The intent of the bill may not be this, but it comes across as a retaliation to US states who put in trade laws that aren’t friendly to us.", "We think we should be looking at those things and taking steps, but I think this bill falls short in the details, and we’re concerned about that." ],

If you want your businesses to have access to that procurement, if you want your steel companies to have access to those projects, then ours have to have the same.” I just think that’s inherently fair. In fact, if we weren’t doing that, I think the NDP would be standing up in absolute anger, saying that we should be.", "Right now, I’m sensing that the opposition parties are turning themselves into pretzels, trying to find ways to oppose this.", "I would suggest that, first off, this isn’t political.

We have to protect our businesses and our people in Ontario, especially with what’s going on in the world right now. I guess—the former minister called it an administration. I think it’s more like a dictatorship in the States, but that’s beside the point. We have to defend our resources, our people and our jobs. We can’t stand and be pushed around. I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again: The federal government has to stand up and they have to make it quite clear that Canada has been a good trading partner. We have been a good neighbour, we’ve been there—you name it, through wars, through depressions, through disasters—we’ve been there for the Americans. For them to single us out or make us pay the price, so to speak—then naturally we are going to retaliate and we are going to stand up for our businesses, especially in the steel industry.", "I spent most of my life in the steel industry. We’re just starting—just a touch getting back on our feet in Hamilton, and this guy Trump is going to pull the legs out from underneath us again with tariffs. It’s outrageous and he’s doing it to his own people because the people who bought Stelco—former Stelco—are called Bedrock and they’re from New York City.", "So it’s kind of counterproductive; he’s going against his own business people in the States to put tariffs on us. It’s ridiculous. So, yes, the Ontario government—I don’t care who is sitting over there—did the right thing. We would have to do the right thing to defend our people, defend our businesses, and defend our jobs.", "I will continue to support any efforts by this province to stand up to these unfair practices that are being even thought about down there in Washington.

For example, in 2013 the Wynne Liberals were forced to change the Green Energy Act after it was found to have violated WTO rules. There are countless bills like this on the books throughout the United States, and this government chose not to act then and is only acting now because the Premier wants to pick a fight ahead of the upcoming election.

Then, of course, with an election coming in a very short time frame, they decided to hike the minimum wage.", "So it’s these sort of political decisions—and I think that’s what this is about: picking a trade war with the United States during this critical time in the NAFTA negotiations.

Following a visit to Washington, DC, in recent weeks, the Premier indicated that she will be tabling legislation that will allow the province to respond in kind to New York’s legislation and any other state.", "Texas, Mr. Speaker, has also passed similar legislation—I believe it was in September of last year—which placed Buy American requirements on the iron and steel in certain construction projects. The Premier has used this legislation as a threat to try and prevent these new laws and has maintained that she will use these measures only in proportional retaliation to other governments.", "There has been a lot of media attention around this, and I think this goes to what I said in the opening where this legislation is being used as a political ploy to distract the public from the Liberals’ own economic policies.", "The first headline that I saw says, “Ontario Liberals Introduce Bill to Retaliate Against Buy American Provisions:", "“Ontario’s governing Liberals have introduced a bill to retaliate against any state that adopts Buy American provisions as the provincial Legislature resumes sitting for the final session before a spring election.", "“Premier Wynne had earlier this month declared her intentions to counter protectionist measures put in place by some US states, saying the bill would be the first piece of legislation passed by her government when the session began.”", "It goes on to talk about this being a distraction to the agenda and other issues in the province.", "I think our interim leader, Vic Fedeli, said it best in his remarks in the Legislature; I think it was last week.

It is painfully obvious that this is nothing more than an election ploy by an out-of-touch, out-of-ideas government. This government simply does not understand how business works. This bill makes it painfully obvious.", "So what would we do? Why don’t we look at real solutions to this. I’m going to give you some examples from 2009, when our leader was mayor of North Bay. “US cities were then restricted from buying Canadian-made goods, while Canada had no such restrictions. I wrote to the mayors of US cities where we made large purchases and reminded them that their city would have had layoffs if it weren’t for our purchases....", "“Naturally, we prefer to buy Canadian and Ontario goods, but sometimes we simply don’t manufacture the products here that we need”—not after 350,000 manufacturing job losses.", "“But, because we always want to get the best value for our local taxpayers, we always go for the best price.", "“Here’s one of those examples. North Bay bought a water filtration system that wasn’t made in Ontario. We had to purchase it from Cortland county in upstate New York for $6 million. Cortland county has 20,000 people. I wrote the mayor and said, ‘Can you imagine if they weren’t able to benefit from our purchase?’", "“That mayor understood ... and we fought to keep our borders open. In fact mayors from all over the US fought with us to keep our borders open. That’s how you stop the Buy American plan. You get your US partners to fight with you. You don’t threaten them....”", "The Canadian ambassador wrote: “I wanted to send you a short note to commend the letters that you recently sent to your American counterparts about the impact that restrictions to free and open markets can have on jobs in Canada and the United States. Your effort to explain the great success story of the bilateral trade relationship between Canada and the United States and the positive impact it is having on communities is most powerful.", "“The issue of Buy American has been a very high priority for the Canadian embassy in Washington. Our work is made all the more effective by efforts such as yours and I hope that other Canadian and American mayors will emulate you and tell the story of interdependence and integration as well as you have.”", "Speaker, you need to understand how business works. “Former Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall offered up the best explanation of cross-border supply chains: ‘Saskatchewan farmers buy John Deere tractors made in Iowa, to harvest oats that are then sold to General Mills in Cedar Rapids, turned into Cheerios and exported back to Canada.’", "“Former Canadian ambassador to the US Derek Burney further explained, ‘For Americans more generally, we need to demonstrate specifically and statistically how important our trade is to American jobs and interests and emphasize that damage to one partner inevitably damages the other.’", "“Auto parts cross borders as many as eight times during the production of a vehicle.... We need time to work with our partners, not to threaten them with fake solutions.” The Premier is threatening to stop this. This government has never understood how business works; this piece of legislation reflects that.", "“Something this important cannot be rushed through. This government’s knee-jerk reaction is simply to make a political statement. They did not put forward a well-crafted, well-thought-out, meaningful response” to American policies that could impact Ontario. They just made threats.", "This is our leader: “We have filed a reasoned amendment to do just what it sounds like—to be reasonable in the amount of time given and to be reasonable in the response. This is too important to get wrong.” I wholeheartedly agree with our interim leader’s outlook on this issue.", "Another story; I think this one was in the Toronto Star: “Ontario’s Retaliation Against Buy American Policies a ‘Last-Ditch Election Ploy’ ...", "“‘Initiating a trade war with the United States is a last-ditch election ploy by (Premier) Kathleen Wynne to deflect the blame for her disastrous economic policies,’ Vic Fedeli, the Progressive Conservatives’ interim leader, said.”", "Talking about disastrous economic policies, as I said earlier, I had a great meeting today with the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, reviewing their Vote Prosperity: The 2018 Election Platform of the OCC—just excellent common-sense solutions to some of the challenges we’re having in Ontario, especially just hearing the news a few weeks ago that, in January, we lost, I think it was, 51,000 jobs in the province. It’s the single biggest monthly decline in jobs in this province since the great recession of 2009. A number of things were covered in this chamber report: strengthening business competitiveness, fostering job creation, building healthy communities, and improving government accountability.", "There are a number of recommendations under strengthening business competitiveness:", "“(1) Allow Ontario businesses to purchase surplus electricity at rates equal to or better than the exported price to other jurisdictions.” We all know the story about the decisions that this government has made when it comes to the Green Energy Act, and producing all of this electricity and then dumping it into jurisdictions south of the border.", "In fact, in my riding of Lambton–Kent–Middlesex, there are two major turbine projects. One is in the works, the North Kent project, where the government is continuing to go ahead to build these turbines even though well water is impacted for 17 families now in that community, again, for electricity that we do not even need. And then there’s a second project, with the largest turbines in the country, that the government wants to build near Wallaceburg: the Otter Creek wind project. Again, it makes no sense to continue building more turbines in the province. This is just compounding the issue we have with electricity prices in the province. And, of course, we have environmental issues and water well safety issues. So that’s one suggestion from the chamber.", "(2) They suggest that the government should “Conduct and publish the results of a comprehensive review of the electricity sector, including an objective economic impact analysis assessing the full range of inputs that make up the global adjustment ... and then pursue cost-reducing measures based on the results.", "“(3) Regardless of public policy approach chosen, pursue efforts to reduce Ontario’s greenhouse gas ... emissions in a manner that effectively mitigates risk to business competitiveness.", "“(4) Work with federal and local levels of government to establish a publicly available analysis of the cost of doing business ... in Ontario.", "“(5) Reinstate scheduled reductions in the corporate income tax, standardize the business education tax and reduce the employer health tax.”", "Again, on point number (5) on taxation, regardless of what people think is happening south of the border, the fact is that they are reducing corporate taxes, which is going to put pressure on Ontario’s competitiveness and on the businesses in this province. They have to make decisions on where they’re going to expand. Are they going to expand in Ontario with electricity prices being high when we have a government that’s using this legislation we’re debating today—I think it’s Bill 194—as a political tool to fight with our neighbours? This just isn’t good for competitiveness and the decisions that business people have to make.", "The second pillar that the chamber highlighted is fostering job creation. They have four recommendations here:", "“(1) Modernize the apprenticeship system.", "“(2) Redesign Employment Ontario services for both job-seekers and employers and evaluate the potential of an outcomes-based funding model.", "“(3) Work with industry and post-secondary institutions to ensure that program offerings remain responsive to the changing labour market dynamics and the regional and sectoral needs of Ontario’s business community.", "“(4) Allocate resources to focus support on high-growth firms and those with high growth potential, by delaying taxation on corporate income growth to overcome Ontario’s scale-up challenge.”", "Again, I think these are better solutions than picking a fight with our neighbours in the US, which is what we see in Bill 194, this retaliation measure, just to, I guess, distract from the problems that the government has created for many business people.", "The third pillar is building healthy communities.", "(1) The chamber recommends that the government “Focus on strategic growth policies by ensuring that land use planning and development regulations are aligned, to increase density and create more housing stock.", "“(2) Build adaptable and resilient infrastructure stock that can address future pressures including climate change and demographic shifts.", "“(3) Develop a single transportation authority in the greater Toronto Hamilton area.", "“(4) Strike a health cabinet to improve information-sharing and break down budget silos between ministries.", "“(5) Reform the procurement and supply chain processes within the Ontario health care system.”", "The last pillar, number four, is improving government accountability. Their recommendations are:", "“(1) Create a meaningful plan to tackle the debt and move towards balanced or surplus budgets.” I would say that that’s a very important point and recommendation that the chamber is making because what the government should be focusing on is getting the basics right, and that is to ensure that debt levels are manageable instead of picking a fight with the United States.", "“(2) Ensure all proposed policy, regulation and legislation has been evaluated against sound, quantitative evidence.", "“(3) Establish criteria for measuring progress toward the attainment of strategic goals and publicly publish these targets to ensure transparency.", "“(4) Provide appropriate timelines to stakeholders when revising or implementing initiatives that will impact their operations.”", "On that last point, I would be curious to know of the consultation process that went into Bill 194. Did the the Premier and her economic advisers actually reach out to the business community in Ontario? Do the business people in Ontario want their government picking a fight with the United States during the NAFTA negotiations? It just doesn’t make sense to be doing that. We have lost hundreds of thousands of well-paying manufacturing jobs. A lot of the ones that are left in Ontario now are making a decision on whether they stay here or leave. For the government to not speak on their behalf I think is quite concerning.", "Another headline regarding this bill, Bill 194: “Ontario Liberals to Bring in Bill Retaliating Against”—essentially against the United States and their Buy American provisions:", "“Ontario’s governing Liberals are expected to introduce a bill to retaliate against any state that adopts Buy American provisions as the provincial Legislature resumes sitting ... for the final session before a spring election.”", "I think that says it all, Mr. Speaker: They’re bringing this in because this is the final sitting of the Legislature before the spring election. This is a political ploy. It’s a diversion tactic. They’re not doing what’s in the best interests of the economy here in North America.

Before I go there, I just want to give a shout-out to a gentleman by the name of Bob Purdy. Bob was a colleague of Dennis, my husband. They both worked at Wescast. Dennis worked in product launch and Bob was a seasoned salesperson on the team who regularly, week in and week out, stayed in the States to promote Wescast products. He was a proud foundry man.", "He recently retired. It struck when I was at the retirement party with my husband that he couldn’t have been prouder about what they achieved in the heyday of Wescast and the opportunities with manifolds and turbos—the list could go on. He went to the wall to make sure that there were jobs in Wingham and Strathroy, Ontario, which the member for Lambton–Kent–Middlesex proudly represents.", "The fact of the matter is that we need to think about those people, because auto parts cross the border as many as eight times during the production of one vehicle. We need to ensure that those types of jobs are safe in Ontario." ],

As you can see, he’s feeling the same sentiments as we are in the NDP—that this is a retaliation bill.", "I do want say that I met with the Ontario Chamber of Commerce today. They had a quote here that I read earlier. These are business people who are going to be affected by trade and they are saying to the government, “Positive diplomatic relations should always be our priority when it comes to trade discussions.”", "With this bill, there’s an undercurrent of not doing that. It is retaliatory, right? “If you’re going to do this, then we’re going do the same thing.” No one is saying that we don’t need to have discussions around trade. I think that’s important. Again, I voice my concerns: When there are not details of what you’re going to do to reciprocate those actions of someone else—which is, by definition, retaliation—then it is, really, something that we need to debate. We need to understand the powers of the minister. When we look on page 2, they’ve got very broad power and it’s all under regulation.", "The framework is here, but the details aren’t. We know that we’ve been through this before. We’ve been on this hamster wheel. Many times, this government has a framework, there are no details in the bill, and then we’re not getting what we debated in this House.", "Absolutely, we need to have these discussions. I agree. But let’s hear from the government legislators about what’s in this bill, what the details are—because there aren’t any, Speaker. It’s in regulations." ],

I certainly remember you.", "I’d like to thank my colleague from Huron–Bruce, who talked about this protectionist attitude in measures that the government is taking, and who mentioned Wescast as well. Wescast was a major employer in Strathroy until a few years ago. Hundreds of people lost their jobs. I drive by the former Wescast plant many times during the week, and, of course, it’s shuttered, like many other manufacturing facilities across my riding of Lambton–Kent–Middlesex and across southwestern Ontario.", "Also, I thank my colleague, within the NDP, from London–Fanshawe for her remarks on this bill as well.", "Coming from southwestern Ontario—these NAFTA negotiations are very important to the families in the communities I represent, and right across southwestern Ontario. The agricultural community is looking at the negotiations. The manufacturers, the small businesses and the medium-sized businesses, I think, to put it mildly, are quite afraid of the actions this government is taking, especially during these negotiations on NAFTA.", "I think a lot of us and a lot of people see through it as yet another political decision to distract from some of the initiatives the government has brought forward that have killed jobs and killed businesses in the province of Ontario." ],

Dr. Hoskins did, so it was always very interesting to talk to him about health care.", "I would say that the best conversations I have had with him and where, in my view, he shined the most were when we were talking about a specific patient, a specific family in need. Then you could see the empathy he has towards helping people. Most health care providers—you go into health care because you want to help people. It was obvious when you would speak to him about a specific client, a specific family, that if he could help, he did.", "I know that last week, I talked a lot about a family in my riding. Mrs. Adler is in ALC in the hospital. Her husband is in a long-term-care home. We’re trying to reunite them. He was most helpful to make sure that the LHINs and the long-term-care home understood the new regulations that had been put in for couple reunification. He had people in his office call my local LHINs and the local long-term-care office.", "As I said, this is one example, but I have worked with him on many, many cases to help resolve something at the local level—sometimes in my riding, sometimes someplace else in our province—and he has always shown a lot of empathy and a lot of caring for people.", "I thank you for your indulgence, Speaker.", "I will now turn my focus to something completely different, which is Bill 194, the Fairness in Procurement Act.", "Je vais commencer mes remarques en français. Comme j’avais mentionné lorsque j’ai eu la chance, la traduction en français est assez énigmatique. Lorsque l’on parle de « procurement » en anglais, en français en Ontario, on parle d’approvisionnement. Mais dans le projet de loi 194, ils l’ont traduit par « marchés publics ».", "Je vous dis que ça fait Google pas mal, cette affaire-là. Ce n’est pas un terme que l’on utilise dans l’Ontario français. Dans l’Ontario français, on parle d’approvisionnement, puis on sait ce qu’on veut dire quand on parle de ça. Je n’ai aucune idée de pourquoi on a cru bon de mettre un titre comme « marchés publics ». Ça fait penser beaucoup plus à « free trade » que ça fait penser à l’approvisionnement. Mais en tout cas, c’est là. Moi, je vous dirais que, du côté francophone, on aurait pu mettre un petit peu plus d’effort, puis ça aurait été meilleur—mais en tout cas.", "Le projet de loi concernant l’équité en matière d’approvisionnement—parce que c’est comme ça qu’on aurait dû l’appeler. Premièrement, « la loi prévoit que si, de l’avis du ministre, certaines mesures ont été imposées par des acheteurs provenant d’une autorité législative américaine »—donc, je vais m’arrêter tout de suite là.", "Pourquoi est-ce que, ici en Ontario—si on est sérieux qu’on veut parler d’approvisionnement, pourquoi on ne parle que de l’approvisionnement avec nos voisins du sud? Le Canada—on fait affaire avec des centaines de nations à la grandeur de la province. Je ne vois pas pourquoi on a besoin d’une législation spécifiquement pour un pays, soit les États-Unis.", "Je peux vous dire que, dans Nickel Belt, on a toutes les mines de nickel du Grand Sudbury. On a des mines pas seulement de nickel, mais de cobalt, de « platinum », de métaux précieux, etc. On fait affaire autant du côté de l’approvisionnement, pour acheter des choses, que ceux à qui on vend à la grandeur de la planète. C’est planétaire.", "Donc, ici on a une loi qui dit que, pour ce qui est de l’approvisionnement avec nos voisins du sud, on va avoir des règlements qui vont s’appliquer juste à eux. Si d’autres pays font exactement la même chose qu’un des États des États-Unis, bien là, le projet de loi ne rentre pas en ligne de compte.", "Ça, c’est bizarre un peu, parce que—c’est la première ministre qui nous l’a présenté, ce projet de loi-là. Lorsqu’elle s’est levée en Chambre pour nous parler du projet de loi, c’était clair et précis dans sa tête que le projet de loi était là pour protéger les travailleurs et travailleuses de tout l’Ontario. Je suis bien d’accord; je suis néo-démocrate. Je suis bien d’accord de protéger les travailleurs et travailleuses de l’Ontario—bien d’accord avec ça. Mais, de penser que c’est en mettant un projet de loi qui vise juste les États-Unis que l’on va régler les problèmes, je trouve ça un petit peu bizarre—bien, plus qu’un petit peu bizarre, monsieur le Président; je trouve, ça vraiment louche, l’affaire.", "Ça dit que si des acheteurs provenant des États-Unis imposent certaines mesures, « le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil »—donc, le gouvernement au pouvoir—« peut désigner celle-ci comme étant une autorité législative américaine fautive. » Là, on va encore plus loin, dans le sens qu’on va nommer les autorités législatives américaines fautives dans le projet de loi.", "En passant, ça ne vous gardera pas réveillé pendant des jours et des jours, lire ça; on parle de deux pages. Donc, dans les deux pages du projet de loi, on explique en long et en large qu’est-ce que c’est qu’une « autorité législative américaine fautive ». Dans un premier temps, il faut que ça vienne des États-Unis. Dans un deuxième temps, il faut qu’elle ait essayé d’acheter des choses d’une façon qui ne nous plaît pas. Mais, peu importe si toutes les autres juridictions de la Terre font la même chose et que ça ne nous plaît pas plus—là, on ne fera rien. On va juste faire quelque chose si c’est aux États-Unis.", "« La loi prévoit que la participation de fournisseurs provenant d’autorités législatives américaines fautives »—vous vous souvenez, c’est le mot clé qu’on a présenté dans ce projet de loi—« à des processus d’approvisionnement lancés par des entités gouvernementales ou des entités parapubliques est assujettie à certaines mesures et que chaque aspect de cette exigence est assorti des détails et des règles supplémentaires énoncés dans les règlements. La loi permet la prise de règlements établissant des processus pour l’obtention d’exemptions de l’application de la loi ou de ses règlements. Les effets des contraventions à la loi ou aux règlements sont également précisés. »", "Donc, ça, je vous dirais que c’est un cadre législatif dans le sens qu’on dit, bien, s’il y a un État ou une agence parapublique du gouvernement américain qui dit, « Bon, à partir de maintenant, on va acheter telle chose de telle façon » et que ça ne plaît pas à l’Ontario, l’Ontario peut prendre des mesures contre ça. Mais ça ne dit pas quel genre de mesures, si ce sera de façon proportionnelle ou si ce sera dans le même champ d’action. Ça ne dit rien du tout. C’est juste un cadre législatif, et tout le restant des détails est vraiment laissé au gouvernement du jour à savoir ce qu’on va faire avec ça.", "Moi, c’est clair, je n’aime pas ça, des projets de loi qui laissent tout à l’interprétation d’un gouvernement ou qui laissent tout à l’interprétation de règlements futurs. Si tu veux faire quelque chose, bien, mets-le dans le projet de loi; dis-le. Mais là, ça se pourrait bien qu’un État des États-Unis décide de faire quelque chose qui ne nous plaît pas, et l’Ontario va « retalier » contre ça, mais qu’un autre État des États-Unis pourrait faire la même chose, et on ne ferait rien du tout. Il n’y a aucun engagement à ce qu’une action engendre une réaction. On va décider, au cas par cas, s’il y aura réaction. On va décider, au cas par cas, si la réaction sera égale ou si ça va faire escalader les choses, et ça aussi, ça m’inquiète. Je ne vois pas pourquoi on pourrait faire ça.", "Le 21 février, la première ministre est venue ici et nous disait : « Il faut protéger les employés et les employeurs, il faut protéger les entreprises et il faut créer de bons emplois. » Moi, je suis partante; je suis bien contente de ça. Je suis toujours heureuse lorsque l’Assemblée législative s’efforce de protéger nos travailleurs et travailleuses, lorsque l’Assemblée législative veut encourager les entreprises, petites, moyennes et grandes, et lorsqu’on veut créer de bons emplois; moi, je suis prenante. Mais il y a bien des façons de faire ça autre que ce qu’on nous présente.", "Et là, je vois que vous êtes en train de vous lever, monsieur le Président. Aimeriez-vous que je m’assoie?" ],

  "text" : [ "As a former city of Toronto councillor for over 20 years and as a relatively new member of provincial Parliament, it is my privilege and honour to stand today in the Legislature and speak to Bill 68, Modernizing Ontario’s Municipal Legislation Act, 2016. It is a huge bill, amending and repealing many other pieces of legislation to do with how municipalities govern themselves.", "As the esteemed member from Oxford mentioned during past debates, I strongly feel that submissions from individuals, stakeholders and municipalities have been invaluable. Thank you to all the contributors.", "Many of the amendments, in my opinion, deserve positive acknowledgement, such as that giving councils the power to enact bylaws regarding climate change. Another is a new section added concerning the establishing of community councils by municipalities. In fact, Toronto city council is already operating four district community councils. Those are the downtown Toronto, Scarborough, Etobicoke, and North York community councils.", "But as much as the bill is generally a step in the right direction, there are three areas I’d like to highlight that concern me the most. First is the amendment to section 238 of the Municipal Act, 2001, which allows local board members and councillors to participate in meetings remotely via an electronic device. Second is the increase of the cap on what a candidate can personally contribute to his or her own campaign during elections under the Municipal Elections Act, 1996. Lastly is the increase of the contribution limit for elections, from $750 to $1,200 per contributor.", "The amendment to allow councillors to participate in meetings electronically—through Skype, teleconference or other methods—is a major step back in accountability. The government claims this bill’s purpose is to increase accountability and transparency, but its contents clearly say otherwise. Perhaps this amendment would not have been such an issue if there were an explanation for it that makes sense.", "What doesn’t make sense in it is this: The reason that the amendment was made was so that councillors and board members may participate in meetings, even when weather might normally not have allowed for their participation. This may be a sound argument for improving a councillor’s ability to participate in their meetings in rural and northern Ontario, but the same amendment was also applied to the City of Toronto Act of 2006, which, unless you consider any part of Toronto, from Etobicoke to Scarborough, as rural, makes no sense.", "A provision that may make sense for councillors who must drive on roads that receive little to no winter maintenance does not make sense for completely urban cities like Toronto. Looking back through the roughly 25 years of my involvement in municipal politics, I cannot think of a single reason why such a provision would be necessary for Toronto councillors.", "While my main issue with this amendment is the increased lack of transparency and accountability that is being introduced with it, the implications are much broader. It is a glaring example that this bill is, in many cases, a set of sweeping changes, blanket legislation that does not take into account the different needs and the characteristics of the very many municipalities that make up Ontario.", "One-size-fits-all legislation is not a productive way to update the old Municipal Act. What could have been a great opportunity to really cater to the unique requests and needs of each municipality now comes off as an afterthought.", "Another part of the bill that worries me is the changes to the Municipal Elections Act of 1996. It was my assumption that improving our democratic process would be at the forefront of any legislation dealing with campaigning and elections, but for seemingly no reason at all, the amendments in the bill seem to be taking a step backwards, regressing even.", "We have heard from many individuals and municipalities that increasing the cap on what an individual can contribute to their own campaign would create an imbalance in the dollar power of candidates. Of course, running an election is far from cheap, but by raising the cap to $25,000, a candidate’s individual wealth, or lack thereof, can become a deciding factor. It should be up to the strength of a candidate’s ability to fulfill their duties, not the strength of their pocketbooks, to win them an election.", "A higher cap on a candidate’s personal contribution to their own campaign will definitely put wealthier candidates at an advantage over others. This undermines the principles of electing the best man for the job. Equal opportunities for all the candidates, regardless of their independent wealth, should be respected in any democratic society, especially Ontario’s.", "Lastly, the increased cap on individual contributions to a campaign from $750 to $1,200 concerns me. Our own provincial election campaign contributions are capped at $1,200 for ridings that are far larger and more populous than many of the districts a municipal councillor or board member is called to represent. For example, I used to be the Toronto city councillor for ward 42. Now I am the MPP representing Scarborough–Rouge River, which includes both ward 42 and ward 41. In other words, my provincial riding is twice as large as the previous municipal riding. On top of this, it was a lot easier to fundraise for my municipal elections since the donors receive a cash rebate regardless of their income, whereas the provincial election donors only receive a tax rebate if they file income taxes. Therefore, it definitely seems to me that such an increase should be justified by further review and scrutiny.", "As the critic for city of Toronto issues and the member for Scarborough–Rouge River, I know these amendments would affect the areas I am called on to represent, but as an Ontarian myself I know that the implications go beyond my own municipality. The effects of this bill will be felt far and wide, one way or another, so why don’t we take this chance to do right by all the municipalities and give them the legislation they deserve?", "Just to close up, I’m sure the bill is well-intended, but it’s my opinion that we are not doing Ontario right with this one-size-fits-all bill." ],

As has been said by many of my colleagues within the NDP caucus who have spoken to the bill, this is really one of those pieces of legislation where the question is, where is the meat? It’s a fairly lengthy bill. There are a lot of words in the bill, but there is really not a lot of substance.", "However, having said that, one of the changes that I did want to highlight, which I do think is welcome but doesn’t go far enough, is the change to allow council seats to not be considered vacated due to pregnancy or adoption of a child. This is a very important provision. It’s a long-overdue provision. If we want to get more women, particularly more young women, involved in municipal politics, we have to allow for them to run, to serve in elected office and also raise a family.", "One of my concerns is that the legislation does not also include amendments to the Education Act, because trustees are in the same situation. Trustees run for elected office; they are under the same kind of requirements. If you miss three meetings in a row, then your seat is considered to be vacated. Without amendments to the Education Act, this means that trustees who become pregnant while in office, who want to raise a child, may have to vacate their seats because the amendment is not included in the Education Act. We need that to be added to this bill in order to make it fair to everyone in Ontario." ],

The reality is, while there are perhaps valuable components, there are great flaws. We have to be aware of those flaws. We can’t ignore those flaws. The duty of the opposition is to point out where the government is going astray from what would be in the best interests of the citizens of Ontario.", "One of the areas I have a concern with is: I fear that, as this legislation was brought forward, there was insufficient consultation with various municipalities. The one reason I have that is that I asked my mayors. I said, “What do you think about Bill 68? I’d love to hear your concerns. I’d love to hear your thoughts.” It was concerning to me that they said, “Sorry, Bill 68? Come again?” It was surprising, to be honest.", "They did say that they felt very strongly that we needed to ensure the inclusion—that they needed to have expanded ombudsman oversight of municipally owned assets, including hydro companies, or if it deals with expanding criteria for closed session meetings.

As you may know, I had the honour and the privilege of being elected to city council for the city of Niagara Falls for a few years. As this bill touches on a number of municipal issues, I’m happy to speak to Bill 68.", "I look back on my time on city council with a lot of fond memories. Our council rarely ever fought and we always worked together to put the interests of our residents first. I want to be clear: We didn’t always agree, but we certainly always conducted ourselves in a professional manner.", "I think if you ask most people in Niagara Falls they can remember that council was always getting along and putting residents first. Some of the best things around council, quite frankly, happened after council, when we used to go out for beer, pizza, and discuss the council meeting. So I’m proud of the time that I was on council, and I’m certainly happy to speak to the bill.", "One of the major issues not discussed here is municipal funding. We know that the last time the PCs were in government, they downloaded the costs of a number of programs onto municipalities. This always seems to be the case when we’re dealing with the PC government. These are costs that cities and towns across the province are trying to figure out how to cover. In Niagara, there’s no bigger example, as my colleagues that are here today from Niagara know, than mental health.", "I think it’s important for everybody to listen to this. The PCs were the first ones to start downloading and cutting these costs onto cities that simply didn’t have the budgets to cover the services. Once they started, unfortunately, my colleagues the Liberals continued to do it. The result is now that Niagara’s people struggle to find mental health services. Think about this: One in five—not just in Niagara, but right across the province of Ontario—are suffering from mental health issues. You know what pulls on your heartstrings? That includes our kids.", "In Niagara, and I’m sure in other municipalities around the province of Ontario, suicides among young people are up. There’s stress on young people. Some of the reasons for that is that they can’t get the services they need, they can’t get the help early enough. We don’t have the education to pick up on the signs early enough. In my opinion, mental health is a crisis not only in Niagara, but I believe it’s a crisis right across the province of Ontario.", "These services are absolutely essential. No person seeking treatment for mental health should have to jump through hoops only to be told the service doesn’t exist. I understand that this is a health care issue, but frankly it’s an emergency. Our towns and our cities need funding to stop it.", "But here’s something that we also need—again, I wish some people would listen to this; I know it’s early in the morning, but this is important. They need a return to the 50-50 partnership with the province that allowed the cities to carry their fair share of responsibility. So the city would be responsible for 50%; the province would be responsible for 50%. And you know what, Madam Speaker—and I’m looking at you for a reason, because I know you’re listening—it worked. That’s the issue. Nobody can say it didn’t work; it worked. Municipalities were able to service their residents, they were able to get the funding, and they were able to provide the service. That’s so important. Until we start dealing with this properly at the provincial level, services will continue to suffer and property taxes will continue to rise.", "Madam Speaker, I’ve talked about this issue. I’ve talked about it with my colleagues from Niagara as well.", "One of the major issues we’re dealing with in Niagara right now is called an RFPQ process, for our casinos. If you’ll allow me, Madam Speaker, I’d like to explain how this connects with what I was just saying. Right now in Niagara, there’s a real concern that we will not get a major promoter for our casinos as they change who is running them. Right now, they’re there until 2018. They’ve already been told they have to go. Because the RFPQ process has not been open long enough to attract a big name, we’re struggling in Niagara. Woodbine is going to expand. Eighty per cent of our customers down in Niagara come from Toronto. That’s why we need somebody with a big name, similar to what they have in Vegas.", "But here’s the effect. Why is it important? Why is it important to everybody here? Why is it important to the 107 people that are elected here? Because 1,500 jobs depend on this. What kind of jobs are they? They’re good-paying jobs. They have some benefits. Some are unionized, some are not unionized—tourist jobs, long-term jobs. Quite frankly, the reason why casinos were brought in to Niagara Falls and expanded right across the province of Ontario wasn’t for OLG to make money; it was to create jobs in those communities that would host them. So that means 1,500 livelihoods and families depend on this being done properly. If we don’t stand up for them and do the right thing, what is the point of being elected to this Legislature—when we can’t try to protect good-paying jobs in the province of Ontario?", "When it comes to property taxes, all of these residents who work at the casino pay property taxes. If the province doesn’t act and these families lose their jobs, the property tax rate will skyrocket as the city tries to make up for lost revenue—and not just the city, but the entire Niagara region.", "Cities and towns are struggling to cover their budgets, as it is. I ask any of my colleagues here, the MPPS that are here this morning, to talk to your city councils. Most are in debt. Most are paying interest payments. Instead of that money going back into the city, it’s going to a bank or a credit union rather than back into our—because they’re running into debt. If you lose taxpayers, what happens to that debt? The debt goes up.", "They could step in tomorrow and protect these jobs. That’s the kind of action that would actually benefit our municipality.", "Some changes to the Municipal Act are good, and certainly, as the NDP, we appreciate them. But where is the real action? Where is the real movement by this government to help cities and towns? More importantly, where is the real action to help the people who live in the province of Ontario? There are serious municipal issues—and, trust me, I bring them to the attention of every minister in this House. There are serious issues where we could intervene and make a true difference. The casino is just one of them, but it’s an important one.", "Let me talk about one part of the bill which addresses the municipal right to pass a bylaw that addresses climate change. I think, if you look carefully at the legislation, the language here may not be necessary as this is already allowed, but I understand why it’s here. Make no mistake about it—and I want my colleagues over here to hear this. Make no mistake about it: Climate change is one of the defining issues of our time.", "I’m going to repeat that, particularly for my young colleague from Niagara. Make no mistake about it: Climate change is one of the defining issues of our time. I think even more than being a defining issue of our time, it’s a defining issue for the generation that will take over this place when we all leave.", "I know many members in this House have fought passionate battles over things very close to their heart. Whether it’s fighting against poverty, fighting for affordable housing or fighting for the right to a decent job that allows you to raise your family and put your children through school, there is always a cause that drives people to seek election in this House. For me, it was my grandkids.", "I have a lot more to say. I have a lot more pages here, but obviously my time is running out. It’s all about my grandkids. It’s all about my kids.

Well, I’m certainly going to refute what he had to say on that because our government has done an amazing amount for municipalities.

  "text" : [ "On Monday, March 20, 2017, the member from Simcoe–Grey, Mr. Wilson, rose on a point of privilege concerning recent government advertising or announcements on electricity pricing. According to the member, the items—which were issued or authorized by the government, a private utility company and a political party—allude to future price cuts and other changes in the electricity sector. The member alleges that they constitute a prima facie case of contempt because they presume a timeline and outcome of forthcoming legislation. The government House leader, Mr. Naqvi, also spoke to the matter and subsequently filed a written submission. The member from Simcoe–Grey then filed another written submission in reply.", "Having had the opportunity to review the written notice of the member from Simcoe–Grey, the written submissions of the government House leader and of the member from Simcoe–Grey, Hansard, items provided by the member from Simcoe–Grey and other relevant precedents and authorities, I am now prepared to rule on the matter.", "Before I turn to the substance of the member’s allegation, let me remind the House generally about the nature of contempt as partially set out in the classic definition in Erskine May on pages 251, 260 and 261 of the 24th edition:", "“Generally speaking, any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which obstructs or impedes any member or officer of such House in the discharge of his” or her “duty, or which has a tendency, directly or indirectly, to produce such results, may be treated as a contempt even though there is no precedent of the offence. It is therefore impossible to list every act which might be considered to amount to a contempt, the power to punish for such an offence being of its nature discretionary....", "“Other acts besides words spoken or writings published reflecting upon either House or its proceedings which, though they do not tend directly to obstruct or impede either House in the performance of its functions, yet have a tendency to produce this result indirectly by bringing such House into odium, contempt or ridicule or by lowering its authority, may constitute contempts.”", "I will now turn to the substance of the member’s allegation. I have reviewed the items provided to me by the member from Simcoe–Grey. One item, a Ministry of Energy document—it is difficult to determine whether it is advertising—refers to the government’s intention to introduce legislation that would, if passed, provide for changes to the global adjustment refinancing. The other items are two Twitter retweets, a Facebook advertisement, a screen-grab from the Liberal Party of Ontario website, and a voice advertisement that concludes with the words “paid for by the government of Ontario.” Each of these latter items make unqualified and definitive assertions, such as “Your household hydro bill won’t increase beyond the rate of inflation for at least four years” and “25% off starting this summer—Ontario’s Fair Hydro Plan” and “Starting this summer, households will receive an average of 25% off their bill.”", "The member from Simcoe–Grey asserts that these kinds of statements in the various communications provided to me amount to a demonstrated contempt, because they predict and presume the outcome of the decision of the House in first implementing the legislative changes required to give effect to these pledges.", "The message conveyed to the reader or listener of the various communications is certainly definitive: The reduction of the electricity rates will happen. However, for the Speaker to conclude that the communications constitute a prima facie contempt of the House because of their definitive, unconditional language, as the member from Simcoe–Grey invites me to do, then I must first have found the contempt exists because the role of the House and the outcome of a future matter before it are both taken for granted and assumed to be a foregone conclusion.", "Moreover, to combine these conclusions together would further require that the Speaker is also capable of conducting or has some sort of jurisdiction to conduct a legal analysis of the legislative framework that is necessary to produce the results alluded to in the ads and other items. Members know that it is well-established precedent that it is not the Speaker’s role to undertake legal analysis, make legal findings or attempt to interpret the law.", "It is therefore not possible for me to determine whether or not the assembly has a necessary role in the implementation of the measures, certainty about which must be a precondition to a prima facie finding that such a role has been or is being undermined, diminished, obstructed, impeded or disparaged.", "The statement of the Minister of Energy that he will be introducing legislation at some point, as noted by the member for Simcoe–Grey, does not alter this limitation on my authority or sphere of jurisdiction. It is not open to me to interpret or presume what might be in that possible legislation.", "Consequently, I cannot find that a prima facie case of contempt has been established.", "Given this finding, it is not necessary to consider the timeliness arguments raised by the government House leader and the member from Simcoe–Grey, apart from reminding members that timeliness in raising a point of privilege continues to be a requirement.", "I thank the member from Simcoe–Grey and the government House leader for their contributions to this matter." ],

He has a view from the penthouse here this afternoon and not from the floor. He has done some great work already with the Ontario Real Estate Association.", "I’ve had the pleasure of working with the Ontario Real Estate Association for quite a few years now, actually. I’ve been here for almost seven, and one of the first groups I met with, after being elected, were my local realtors. We were very successful once in passing a bill that made life a little bit easier for realtors, and I’ll talk a little bit about that during my discussion here this afternoon.", "Madam Speaker, I spend a lot of time in hockey rinks. As you know, I have two young girls who play rep hockey, so I travel not just in my local Quinte region, but all across the provinces. The one thing that I notice, especially here in Ontario, as I head into a rink, is that I see the names of realtors everywhere. The names of realtors are on the hockey boards at the arenas in Cobourg, Courtice, Peterborough, Windsor and Stoney Creek. They’re on the backs of jerseys of hockey players as well, sponsoring individual players.", "A lot of the people I meet at hockey rinks are real estate agents as well. They have kids who are playing hockey. Some of them, as hockey moms especially, can be kind of boisterous; the hockey dads can be as well.", "But the one thing I would say about this group of people is that real estate agents are enormous supporters of their community. I know what people are saying when they see them on the sides of arena boards, and they see them on the backs of jerseys: “Well, that’s advertising, and that’s not anything new.” It is extremely important that they advertise, but we hear stories in this place every day about how hard it is to keep arenas and community centres open because of the rising costs of electricity and other items. Yes, it’s advertising, but it certainly is going to keep our buildings open in our municipalities, especially the small municipalities that are helping to keep the lights on for the next period.", "I was just in Madoc last week for an all-Ontario hockey series. Congratulations to the Centre Hastings Grizzlies. I saw the names of Steve Bancroft and many other realtors along the walls and the sidelines up in Madoc.", "It’s also advertising on a jersey as well. But how many times, when September rolls around every year, do you read a news story about how expensive minor hockey is getting? Without those ads and without that revenue, it would just get eaten up in bigger and bigger registration fees.", "I know I’m supposed to be on my feet, talking about the fairness issue, and I am going to talk about that, but I wanted to highlight some of my own motivations.", "I’m spoiled in my riding. In every community in it, real estate agents are core members of volunteer efforts, philanthropic efforts and civic efforts, to make sure the community they live in is a better place to live.", "A few of them are here today, either in the gallery or in the overflow room that we’ve set up on the fourth floor. I’d like to acknowledge just a few of them. I apologize, because I am going to miss some.", "My friends Val Miles, from Bancroft, and Dana Yonemitsu, from North Hastings, are here. I don’t think a month goes by where I don’t get an email from Dana or Val because they’re involved in some new charity endeavour in North Hastings.", "Edie Haslauer, Natasha Huizinga, Lisa Comerford, Shannon Warr-Hunter, Al Russell—I just saw him downstairs—Ken Arseneault and Cathy Polan are all here from the Quinte and District real estate association.", "I’ve also got dozens of friends from across Belleville, Prince Edward county, Quinte West and literally right across Ontario who are here today, and others who couldn’t be here today. This bill is an acknowledgement of their efforts in their communities as well.", "In six other provinces, real estate agents are able to personally incorporate. There exists no viable reason that I’m aware of why it has taken this long for Ontario to catch up. Personally, as I said, this is my third time introducing this bill since 2014.", "There may have been some concern about the cost previously, but recent studies have shown that it’s entirely likely that this change is revenue-neutral and actually could potentially have a positive impact of over $9 million to the province’s GDP. Similar studies also show the potential creation of between 33 and 89 jobs across the province. Those are very modest numbers, but every one of these jobs matters, especially in small rural communities.", "As a former small business and red tape critic, there’s another aspect of this bill that I’d like to highlight, and that’s how we lined up the legislative framework for Ontario’s personal incorporation regime with British Columbia’s.", "I can vividly remember having people come into my office, in my former role, and tell me that one of the biggest problems with regulations across Canada was how rarely you could get two provinces, particularly two big provinces, on the same side. As a result, you started to multiply the regulatory burden.", "Having 10 different provincial regulatory frameworks barely made sense before the digital age, and it makes no sense now. Capital is more mobile than ever. Consumers are able to complete transactions electronically—something that the member from Ottawa Centre and I worked on a couple of years ago—and work with real estate agents anywhere in the country, separated from the telephone tether or the fax machine. With Mr. Naqvi, we worked together on the e-signature bill, which allows real estate transactions to be done over iPads and the latest technology. Transactions that took days or weeks can now be done in hours.", "It’s also important to note the number of professions that we already allow to personally incorporate: lawyers, health care professionals, accountants, mortgage brokers and financial advisers. Drawing the line where we currently have it doesn’t only seem unfair, it also seems a little bit random.", "I want to return to the people who inspired me to bring this bill forward. I want to go back again, if I could, to the hockey rink, one of my favourite places to be. I don’t get to spend enough time at the hockey rink anymore. I used to love coaching hockey. I’ve brought this bill forward twice before, but there are always other issues that I wanted to use for my ballot date as well. There are significant issues in my riding that I wanted to bring forward.", "Today came about, actually—last spring, I was at a Wellington Dukes game. That’s a local junior hockey team in Prince Edward county. A couple of the realtors who were in the crowd at the Dukes game came to me and they said, “Hey, what’s happening with your personal real estate corporation bill? When are you going debate this bill again? We really, really want this to happen.” It seemed as if the next event that I went to, there were more realtors there who were saying, “Hey, whatever happened with your personal real estate incorporation bill? When are you going to introduce that again? Are we going to be able to incorporate like six other provinces can?”", "They really want this bill passed, and I understand why. They wanted this bill to finally get back on the floor of the Legislature and hopefully make it to committee and become law. Hopefully, Madam Speaker, today is that day. We’ve talked about fairness. We’ve talked about the great people in my riding who have asked me to bring up this bill. But I want to address where the money is going to go with a couple of statistics that were dug up in preparation for debate here this afternoon.", "As I mentioned earlier, our realtors, our real estate agents in our communities are at all of the community events that I go to. You can’t go to an event where there’s not a real estate agent there either organizing the event, attending the event or selling tickets to people on their Rolodex to make sure there are great crowds at these events. Real estate agents really do care about their community. Here are a couple of stats for you: 67% of all agents and brokers make donations to charity every year—that’s a pretty large number—and 45% volunteer in a community group or organization every year. That means they are giving of their time; almost half of them are giving a lot of their time to volunteer on these committees. Those numbers are pretty good as well.", "The rate of volunteerism and donations for those agents under the age of 35 actually well exceeds millennial numbers across the country. In those small communities that I was talking about earlier, the numbers go from 67% and 45% to 73% and 55%. Quite often, we hear that our young people aren’t as engaged as they could be and they are not volunteering their time and we’re worried about losing our volunteers, but those numbers are pretty staggering from the real estate sector. I think it just goes to show the commitment that our local real estate agents have to our communities.", "There are a lot of communities in this province. I’ve talked about just a couple of them: Bancroft, Wellington and Picton, where the Rotary, the Kiwanis Club and the hospice foundation might not exist without the help of local real estate agents.", "Another example of this at the provincial level is the Realtors Care Foundation. Since its original inception, the foundation has granted more than $15 million on behalf of Ontario realtors to shelter-based organizations across the province. The foundation is funded primarily through donations, directly from member dues, called the Every Realtor Campaign. Member boards donated $1 per member per month from 2012 to 2015. Realtors across Canada have raised over $91 million for the Realtors Care Foundation—pretty phenomenal.", "The reason I keep bringing this up is because I wanted to handle the question of where the money is going—it’s a question that we’re so often seized with in this House—meaning the money that will be coming back to the community. I think we can assess where the money is going to go by where the money has gone.", "The reason real estate agents invest in their communities is to build their business, but the best ones—and I’m grateful to count some among my very, very good friends—see their community as their business as well. Giving realtors the same right to personally incorporate that we have given other professions, and the same right that they have in other provinces, seems to me to be the right thing to do—and not just the right thing to do; it seems like the fair thing to do, and that’s why we’re here this afternoon.", "I’d like to thank all of those people who came from Quinte and Bancroft and made the trek here to the Legislature today. I hope that we’ll have good news for you at the end of the debate.", "I look forward to the comments, especially from my co-sponsors, the member from Kitchener–Waterloo and the member from Eglinton–Lawrence, and all members who will be speaking to this bill here this afternoon.", "I hope we can come together and make sure that we get some real fairness for realtors in Ontario." ],

We don’t do this very often; it’s a very rare occasion. But sometimes it takes our collective efforts to get something done in this place. I’m very pleased to be standing in my place in support of Bill 104.", "I know that we’re joined this afternoon by real estate professionals from across Ontario. Thank you for making the trip to Queen’s Park.", "I also want to acknowledge former parliamentarian Tim Hudak, who is here. He seems to be weathering his “recovering politician” status very nicely.", "I also want to mention two realtors in particular for coming from Kitchener–Waterloo: Charlotte Zawada and Bill Duce.", "I would like to start by talking about the important work that real estate professionals do in the province of Ontario. As anyone who has bought a home or leased a property knows, the relationship that you have with your realtor is not only critical, it’s very, very personal, and there’s a great deal of trust involved. We are pleased that you have placed your trust in us, as legislators, to balance the scales for realtors with Bill 104.", "At the root, this is about fairness. Many other regulated professionals can incorporate their businesses personally, like doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants, mortgage brokers, insurance agents, social workers, architects and engineers. For too long, realtors have been left out of this group. Ontario is overdue to harmonize its rules with BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec and Nova Scotia, all provinces that have made changes since 2008 to allow personal real estate corporations in their provinces.", "We know the important role that realtors play in our local economies. I wanted to take a little time just to talk about that role and what this bill will mean to local realtors, from the perspective of a real estate professional in Waterloo.", "Chris Stanley is a young realtor, five years in the business, and he works out of McIntyre Real Estate Services in Waterloo. It’s a small brokerage firm, and each member of the team relies on their areas of expertise to be successful.", "Forming personal real estate corporations will make it easier for Chris and his colleagues to invest back in refining their areas of expertise, particularly with a focus on technology. Because they’re smaller, they are constantly trying to keep up with the needs of their clients, and that means having to come up with ways to keep track of what they need. They are investing in software that will make that easier and faster for them.", "The other thing that a personal real estate corporation will allow Chris to do is to think about hiring someone new to his team. He’s looking at young people, people from outside the real estate world who are looking for a new career or an opportunity. This is, by all accounts, a rewarding career. Charlotte just told me over lunch today that she doesn’t feel that her work as a real estate agent is work. It’s a career that helps other people reach their potential, and it’s a lifestyle and it’s very rewarding. That’s exactly the kind of thing this Legislature should be finding ways to do together. It doesn’t happen nearly enough.", "At the end of the day, Chris said, even in a hot housing market like the one we are reminded of daily here in southwestern Ontario and in Toronto, a realtor’s job is an emotional one. Clients who have had their third or fourth offer rejected are in an emotional place, quite often. Part of what realtors do is help give clients more faith in the process and in Ontarians searching for a new place to call home. I should also mention that Chris told me that a personal real estate corporation will give him more of an opportunity to give back, and we’ve already heard about the generosity of real estate agents across the province.", "Chris is already on the board of Reception House in Waterloo, helping with the resettlement of Syrian refugees. He already knows the importance of giving back, but he wants to do more. Bill 104 would help him, even just a little bit. That’s important, and I think it’s worth getting on the record, Madam Speaker.", "I also want to mention that Chris shares something in common with two members co-sponsoring this bill. Not only does he live and work in the fine community of Waterloo, he was born and raised in Belleville, which is a city I believe the member for Prince Edward–Hastings knows well.", "In my opinion, the impact that this bill will have on what real estate agents can do in their local communities is even greater than the estimated $9 million to $24 million that a study suggested that personal real estate corporations could add to Ontario’s GDP. After all, real estate agents live in the communities in which they work. In order to be successful, they need to be active, engaged members of their communities. From talking to Chris and other realtors from Kitchener–Waterloo and across the province, Bill 104 will make it just a little bit easier for them to give back to their communities.", "I’m proud to stand in my place today to offer my support for Bill 104 for real estate professionals like Chris Stanley, like Charlotte and like Bill. We can do something positive here today together as legislators. Let’s get it done and let’s make it law." ],

I happen to have the good fortune of attending and coaching and teaching at the birthplace of hockey: St. Michael’s College School in Toronto. Hockey goes back to the 1830s. I had the pleasure of going to school with guys like Dave Keon and Frank Mahovlich and of teaching Red Kelly’s sons.", "Tonight, my niece is playing in the OFSAA, the Ontario finals, for senior girls’ hockey, representing Bishop Allen high school in Mississauga. I have to go to that. Then I have my grandson playing in the Toronto city finals in Atom. I don’t know how I’m going to make it. One is at 6 and one’s at—you need a good vehicle when you’re a hockey grandparent or a hockey parent.", "I want to tell you a little personal story because, as the two previous speakers mentioned, there are many sides to real estate agents. They are many-faceted people—all walks of life and all nationalities.", "Two weeks ago, I was telling Ettore Cardarelli, who’s with the executive board of OREA, I had a long-time friend of mine—I’ll just say that his name was Paul. He’s a real estate agent; he has been one for 50 years, almost. He was very active in his church here in Toronto. He was involved in all the ratepayer groups and police liaison committees. He came to my office two weeks ago and said, “I’m very embarrassed, Mike, but I don’t have any income. I haven’t sold a house in three months, and I want to get on social assistance.”", "These are the real estate agents you don’t hear about. You hear about the ones that are successful, and God bless—but there are so many real estate agents who basically go from sale to sale. In Toronto right now, in the GTA, sure, you hear about 20 offers, as Ettore told me—20 offers on a deal. One agent makes a commission; the other 19 get zero. Nobody ever talks about those that get zero. There are so few listings in the city of Toronto. I’ve never seen so few for sale signs. I’m sure it’s the same thing in Parkdale. You would see for sale signs up and down every street in Toronto. It’s a rarity that you see a sign. So that means that there is less work and less income, so there’s a lot of real estate agents who are suffering. Again, those are the ones who never get talked about, and many of them don’t want to tell you they’re having a hard time, but, in these very buoyant times for housing prices and condo prices, there are many struggling men and women in the real estate industry—many of them. Those are ones that we should also be mindful of.", "I want to say that back in 2006, I was working in the Ministry of Finance as parliamentary assistant. We passed legislation regulating the mortgage brokers of Ontario. It was the Wild West of mortgage brokers. Everybody was claiming to be a mortgage agent and they were getting all kinds of money out with no real financial basis for it, so we had to control it. We put it in the Mortgage Brokers Act, which was passed in 2006.", "In that act, we allowed mortgage brokers to incorporate. There was no opposition; there was no concern from the Ministry of Finance and third parties. They said, “Yes, that makes sense. Let mortgage brokers incorporate.” They have. They’ve been incorporated since 2006.", "As we know, doctors are all incorporated. We passed that law. Lawyers have been incorporated for a long, long time. Insurance agents and brokers can be incorporated. The question I’ve always asked, and I’ve asked it in the House before, and to my colleagues, is, “Listen, if you’re doing it for all these other professionals, why are real estate agents not allowed to have the same opportunity?” That is really one of the core issues here: allowing them to do what other comparable professionals have been doing for years, with no real concern about the impact on the economy and the cost. To me, it’s an investment that the province makes in small business. Really, your real estate agents are your prototypical small business men and women.", "The one thing about that industry is that it gives great opportunity to new Canadians. You see all over—if you go to Brampton, you go to Mississauga, so many newcomers are given an opportunity to be in business through the real estate industry. They also are very, very involved in their communities. That’s the other good thing about this bill: It really is supportive of these small business people.", "The other thing, as you know—I don’t know what the breakdown is, but I think there are about as many women real estate agents that I’ve run across as I have males. It’s a great opportunity for women to get into the industry. You don’t see as many in some of the other comparable industries. That’s another aspect of this industry, the real estate industry.", "I know the member from Prince Edward–Hastings talked about his friends. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention some of my long-term neighbours who are in real estate. I know Ezio Cimicata. He not only sells real estate, but every Friday he also goes to the Columbus Centre and they have a sing-along with all of the seniors. He takes time off work—I’m not trying to say that all real estate men and women are Mother Teresa; they’re regular people. So I have to mention Ezio Cimicata, who has been in real estate, I think, for 30 or 40 years.", "I also want to mention another person I knew who just started in real estate back in the early 1970s. Everybody said, “You’re never going to have a chance. You’re never going to do well. It’s too tough an industry. You’re a woman. What are you going to do?” This person is probably one of the top 10 real estate salespersons in Canada: Josie Stern. You’ve probably heard of her. She’s from Toronto. She has done extremely well. I have to mention Josie Stern. She started from nothing, going door to door, and now she has developed a reputation as being a good representative of her clients, with a lot of integrity. I’m going to send this Hansard to Josie, because she also gets very involved in supporting the community, as does Ezio. I wanted to mention those two local agents.", "I just think that this is an opportunity really for us to understand that this incorporation essentially makes it a little easier for people in a very tough industry to get a few tax breaks—not big ones. We’re talking about things that just make life a little easier if you’re in small business, because the difficulty everybody has in small business is taking all of their life savings and putting it into a business. You have to pay for the office, the overhead, the staff. This legislation just makes it a bit easier, as it involves some measures that enable someone to ensure that they can do their business in a way that is somewhat profitable, so they can pay their salaries and take home some money.", "That’s what it does. It really makes it a little easier for them. Instead of being a one-person operation, they might hire a couple of staff and they might just be able to expand what they do in a bigger—it’s not about the big Re/Maxs of this world. We’re talking about the individual agents and brokers here, who are all across Ontario. This would facilitate their ability to essentially earn money and be successful.", "As I said—just to finish up now—it is a very tough business. To be successful in real estate, you make that one sale that looks—so many people get their licence and they try it and say, “God, I can’t get a client. I can’t sell houses.” It is a very challenging business. Even in these so-called good times, there are very few listings." ],

We know that other provinces—as mentioned before, we’ve got BC, Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Nova Scotia—have all enacted similar legislation for over a year now.", "Other regulated professions, as you mentioned, like chartered accountants, lawyers, health professionals, social workers, mortgage brokers, insurance agents and a little bit more—the list goes on—have been able to personally have incorporations, yet this government has remained steadfastly silent on this issue in particular—up until now. Thank you to the member for bringing this forward again.", "As an insurance broker myself, I dealt with real estate agents on a daily basis. We insured the homes; real estate agents sold the homes. We had that professional relationship, in order to have a contract under the insurance provision in order to make sure the sale of the home could actually go through, because that was one of the things you needed to sell or buy a home.", "I also want to say a particular thank you to the Ontario Real Estate Association for their efforts, coming to Queen’s Park and lobbying MPPs so that we’re here now seeking the changes we’ve being asked for on the personal real estate corporation.", "This legislation has been brought to this chamber on two previous occasions since 2008, yet this government has continued to let the issue die on the order paper over and over again—up until now, but we’re really looking forward to results. We hope this third time will be a charm.", "I have met with local real estate agents in my riding of London–Fanshawe, and they made their position very clear. They are rightfully feeling excluded and overlooked by this government. They talked about how they wanted to make sure this got pushed through the Legislature and how quickly this thing can happen. Of course, we had a discussion about how it’s up to the government to bring these things to committee and have them up for consultations etc.", "KPMG’s own study showed that this legislation offers the potential, as mentioned, to increase income into the Ontario gross domestic product, as well as job creator potential. It could be realized in roughly a 10-year period, depending on the realtor uptake. For my riding of London–Fanshawe, with persistently high unemployment rates, due in no small part to the Liberal government’s agenda—and I have to say that because there has been a lot of manufacturing that has left London–Fanshawe and as a result, we’ve seen a lot of unemployment. It’s very slow economic growth that we’ve seen, and it’s very stagnant.", "This government really needs to stop playing favourites with business and small business sectors. It’s time that we create a baseline of fairness for everyone. We need to level the playing field. We have watched the Liberals sell off water for mere pennies to large corporations. We’ve watched them give billions of dollars away in tax and corporate write-offs to companies that packed up and crossed the border without living up to their commitments to employees. We have the opportunity here today to show real estate agents across the province that we support them and the vital work that they do in our communities.", "We’ve mentioned this before. Real estate agents give back to their communities. They actually participate in the health of our neighbourhoods. I’ll use a few examples in London, particularly the London and St. Thomas real estate association. They are the real estate agents that came to see me. Their members support vital community organizations, including women’s shelters, youth sports and recreation teams and programs that provide nutritious meals and snacks to thousands of children.", "One of the things that I had taken away from that discussion is that they’re very proud of the work they do as real estate agents for their healthy communities. It really came through when I was speaking to them about how honoured they are that they’re able to do this kind of thing through their work as real estate agents.", "I think it’s time that we support those who are supporting our communities and afford them the basic protections offered to so many other professions in Ontario. I hope we can all do the right thing today and pass this bill for tax fairness for real estate agents." ],

It’s important that they’re here to show their support for what we’re trying to do in this House.", "For the folks who don’t know, who are here, this is part of private members’ business.

In order for these small businesses to succeed, they need to be able to compete with similarly sized breweries across the country.", "This is not rocket science. Brick called for the raising of the ceiling to 400,000 hectolitres, which is in line with the standards set in Alberta. Raising the ceiling to 400,000 hectolitres would allow these small breweries to grow more proportionally to their capacity.", "Ontario’s craft breweries are strong examples of small business success in our province. They brew great beer and provide Ontarians with good job opportunities. Ontario Craft Beer Week should not only be a celebration of craft breweries but a moment to acknowledge the ways that we can improve incentives for small breweries to grow.", "I just want to say, on a personal note, that the craft breweries, the craft distillers and the craft winemakers in this province—when you meet these people, these are individuals who have dreams of creating a product that they can indeed be proud of. They want to be part of the local economy. Many of them have amazing connections with the farmers and the local food producers in their communities. These models of economic growth on a micro level and on a macro level are the way we should be growing our economy in the province of Ontario. Certainly lifting the hectolitre limit would incentivize more job growth, more product growth and truly make this province a leader globally in the craft brewery industry.", "We’ll be supporting your motion, but we will also be holding your government to account to ensure that we support the craft brewers in the province of Ontario." ],

Whenever I visit a community, we usually have a lunch or a dinner and we make a point of typically, if we can find one, going to the local microbrew pub. The reason that it’s such a pleasure going to one of the microbrew pubs—whether it’s in small-town Ontario, a little village, a mid-size town or even a larger city like Toronto, where there are microbreweries, I always ask the waiter or waitress, “What is your local microbrew?” They will often tell me, “Well, we’ve got this,” and they’ll run through three or four brands with me. Then they’ll get into—it’s almost like a wine-tasting thing. They’ll start talking about the flavours of this beer and the flavours of that beer, and if I’m having this kind of food maybe I would like that kind of beer.", "What it does is that it leads to a conversation, because the next thing that comes up, I will often ask, “Who’s behind the microbrewery? Where is it made? How did it come to be?” Inevitably, when they tell me that story of how the microbrewery got started—whether it’s in any of the towns or cities or villages in Ontario—there’s the very human story behind the start-up of that microbrewery. It leads to a broader discussion about their community and the role that that microbrewery has played in the community.", "I make that point because it does serve to demonstrate the significant local economic impact, local business impact and, indeed, I broaden it out and say the local cultural discussions that have surrounding why that particular microbrewery has done so well.", "While I don’t want to name any particular microbrews, often I end up in the same community a couple of times a year and I know the different microbreweries to go to. In fact, in that regard, microbreweries are located in 110 communities in Ontario. There are 180 operating microbreweries. There are another 50 in the planning stage—that just shows you how popular microbreweries are. There are an additional 30 brew pubs, which have a different licence that doesn’t permit them to sell to the home consumer, but you can have that beer at the brew pub.", "I can say that of the over 80 Ontario craft brewers that are currently members of the Ontario Craft Brewers association—they’re adding new members at the rate of two a month. So that’s 24 a year, 25 a year. That just tells you how popular the microbreweries are, how much they mean to those local communities and, really importantly, how much the customers who are consuming microbeers or locally brewed beers place on that experience.", "Earlier this week—it was Tuesday night, I think—" ],

There were exotic beers, microbrews, that I had never heard of. You’d have a conversation with the brewmaster or his staff, and the conversation would be on what the beer is all about—again, always a discussion about the community from which the beer came. It often ended with an invitation to drop in to the microbrewery if I was in that part of the province.

If we’re going to support craft brewers by proclaiming this week, then we also have to take it a step further and give them all a better chance at success by raising those hectolitre limits from the current 50,000, which is far too low and is not in keeping with the limits in other jurisdictions.", "I want to talk about the Whitewater Brewing Co. in my riding. I met with the owners last month. It’s co-owned by two gentlemen, one by the name of Chris Thompson and the other by the name of Chris Thompson. It’s quite unique. It’s a unique beer, a unique brewery, and the two co-owners actually have the same first names and surnames. One, I believe, is Christopher N. and one is Christopher D.

There’s short Chris Thompson and there’s tall Chris Thompson. They play basketball with tall Chris Thompson on a regular basis in Pembroke. In fact, Lucas is coming home this weekend to play in a tournament in Pembroke. That’s how small the world can be, sometimes.", "I am certainly eager to support this bill proclaiming Ontario Craft Beer Week.

All of us here should be proud of our thriving craft breweries, wineries and distilleries in this province. You can probably find at least one in the majority of our ridings.", "This bill proclaims the week commencing the second Sunday in June each year as Ontario Craft Beer Week. That makes sense, because it aligns with the annual Ontario Craft Beer Week, which is one of the biggest concentrations of beer festivals and events in the calendar year.", "There are over 70 craft breweries in Ontario today, and the number is growing rapidly. Each one began as a small business, and some of the more successful ones have scaled up to medium-sized companies. They are Ontario owned and operated, founded by Ontario entrepreneurs and supporting thousands of Ontario jobs.", "As I’m sure everyone in this building can testify to, the people in the Ontario craft beer industry truly love what they do. They have a real passion for crafting unique local products with a sense of place and attachment to their home community. This Legislature has a proud history of promoting Ontario craft beer, as it does Ontario wine. I’m very pleased to say that our publicly owned LCBO has been a strong promoter of Ontario craft beers.", "There are new craft breweries in the Hamilton area, and I’d like to recognize the excellent work they’re doing. Collective Arts Brewing is quite widely known, as you can find their products on the shelves of many LCBOs. Nickel Brook Brewing is also widely distributed in the Beer Store and the LCBO and has been around for about 12 years now. They share a brewing facility with Collective Arts at the old Lakeport brewery site on Burlington Street East in Hamilton’s north end. The brewery even has a summer beer garden that’s open for people to visit.", "The Hamilton Brewery brews on contract in St. Thomas but can be found in dozens of our city’s bars and restaurants. The Shawn and Ed Brewing Co. is a very new brewery located right in the heart of downtown Dundas, in the 150-year-old former Dundas curling and skating rink.", "One of the great things about the craft beer scene is the hometown pride.

It’s a really remarkable transformation that’s going on. Historically, beer was a small-scale farmhouse product. We’ve almost come full circle over the last two centuries to the craft beer revolution today.", "Many of our Ontario breweries are now exporting their products to the United States. You can find Ontario beer throughout the Great Lakes region and the Midwest. It’s really interesting that we’re seeing this bloom of small craft breweries at the same time as we’re seeing waves of mergers and consolidations worldwide in the big beer corporations. We have to remember that thousands of Ontarians work for the big breweries and that there is still a very high demand for their products. It’s a great thing that we’re creating so much choice and, along with that choice, more jobs for Ontarians.", "People have different tastes. Some love the more traditional products from the larger breweries; some are fans of the porters, the India pale ales, the red ales and so on. Craft beers tend to—not always, but tend to—have a higher alcohol content than we’ve become accustomed to. You have to watch yourself when you drink some of these beers, and certainly don’t get behind the wheel. They are often treated like wine, where you have one or two and you try to pair it with a meal, and it’s so good you might have a couple more. I had never realized before that beer could be as successfully paired with food as wine can, and that it’s often a much better fit. It depends on your taste. It makes sense when you think about it, as beer comes from grain, just as bread does.", "It’s really important to recognize the tourism component to this, because it spills over into the local food industry, music and beer festivals. Supercrawl in Hamilton, which has become famous, for example, is a great local music festival event where you can easily sample Hamilton’s craft beers and many other food products and specialties of the Hamilton area.", "Having a thriving local food and drink scene is a boon for tourism, especially in small-town and rural Ontario. It’s an encouragement and invitation to passers-by to take a detour off their highway travels. They play the same role as local restaurants and help to support one another.", "Craft breweries are becoming a major neighbourhood attraction in our cities too, often in old industrial areas, but you can find small breweries hidden down laneways in residential neighbourhoods too.", "Thank you to the member for Northumberland–Quinte West for bringing this bill forward, and thank you to the thousands of people in Ontario’s craft brew industry for the passion, skill and entrepreneurship you bring to your work every day." ],

He had a metal fabricating shop—and, I believe, still has a metal fabricating shop—up in the East York section above O’Connor, where he was slowly taking over bits of his metal fabricating to add tank upon tank upon tank to brew great ales. I’ve sampled his porter, I’ve sampled his stout and I’ve sampled his great English bitter. I’m just delighted to see you here and to congratulate you for what you do.", "I also want to recognize Mark Murphy. Mark operates a brewery with his wife, Mandie, called Left Field Brewery.

It was almost 40 years ago, Speaker—I hate to admit it, but almost 40 years ago—that I spent almost a year in England, where I got to really enjoy good old English ales. When I came back to Canada, I’ve got to tell you, Canadian beer just didn’t quite do it for me anymore. So I joined a group called Campaign for Real Ale, and at the time we went out and we changed the rules on microbrewing in Ontario almost 40 years ago. Now, to see where that has taken us, to the 150-or-so breweries in every single riding in the province of Ontario, is fantastic.", "I remember that one of the first microbreweries that started at that time was a company called Conners. Conners made their beer in the Eglinton and Victoria Park area, not far from where I represent—in fact, they may have actually been in my riding, but very close—and they made it in these two-litre and half-litre plastic jugs. It was a very unique way of marketing beer.", "They called themselves Conners because a conner was a tax-collecting agent in the early days in England. The conner would go into a pub that was making its own beer and would test the fullness of its fermentation by wearing leather chaps, pouring the beer on the wooden seat, and sitting down and finishing the rest of the beer. If the conner stood up and his pants were sticking, it meant the beer hadn’t been fully fermented. That’s what Conners beer comes from; it’s conner. When he stood up and it didn’t stick, he would raise his pint and say, “The brew is true.” That’s the history of where we started almost 40 years ago, and now we’re seeing the opportunity we have in grocery stores, where we’re selling craft beers.", "We required 20% of craft beers to promote them in the marketplace, but some stores have taken on the challenge, saying, “No, we’re going to stock up to 50% on our shelves, of craft beer.” Speaker, I can tell you, it has been so incredibly successful that now over 80% of the sales in the Metro in my neighbourhood are going to craft beers, and I’m absolutely delighted to hear about that.", "I stand in support of this bill, which coincidentally will be held in the same week that I’m proposing Men’s Health Awareness Week: the week preceding Father’s Day.

So while the government has implemented some of the aspects that I brought forward in the Raise a Glass to Ontario Act, back in 2013 or 2014, whenever it was, there’s still far more that we can do to provide access for them. They’re starting to get into the grocery stores, which is great. They want the ability to cross-sell, which means that if you’re Amsterdam Brewery, you could sell other craft beers in your location. If you’re Muskoka, up in the Muskoka region, you could sell Spearhead up there; you could sell Amsterdam. You would have like a mini craft beer store. I think that’s what they’re saying. The Beer Store is such a giant monopoly that they would like to have a similar opportunity to create this extra retail space at their breweries. I think that’s a great idea, and I know it’s something that the craft beer association is still interested in doing.", "While I’ve been to all of these breweries, I find it really exciting in my region, where Barley Days Brewery was the first—Chris and Nora Rogers—down in Prince Edward county.

I want to be clear that we understand that the challenges are real.", "We also were quite taken aback by the Premier’s doubling down on the gas tax in that whole political exchange and tension, if you will, between the provincial level of government and the city of Toronto.", "But I just want to take a step back and remind us where we are right now. Two cents from every litre of gas go into a provincial pot of gas tax money—not to be confused with the federal gas tax—and that is distributed by the Ministry of Transportation to 99 of the 444 eligible municipalities. It’s roughly $300 million a year and obviously, somehow, it’s going to be doubled. Municipalities are eligible for this type of funding if they have a public transportation system. That is, I think, the main point of contention that the member has already raised. What the bill says is that it’s unfair to exclude the other 345 municipalities from receiving funding, because people in rural Ontario have no choice but to drive. This is a point that has been made by our northern and our rural members as well.", "Ultimately, though, the formula that’s associated with Bill 93 makes the pot of money smaller for everyone. The member has said that this is an allocation issue; we believe that is true. It is an allocation issue. There is no debating that rural communities need better funding for transit, but taking away funding from other municipalities is not the way to do that. Municipalities who receive this funding have come to rely on it year over year. They are desperate for this funding, and we have heard this time and time again. Taking away a steady stream of funding from municipalities who already don’t have much isn’t the answer. We see this piece of legislation as not being the solution to what we have as a shared problem in the province of Ontario with regard to infrastructure funding. Taking money away from those municipalities who receive a small pittance of money—some of them—to redistribute it through a convoluted formula isn’t the answer.", "I was going to talk a little bit about this formula because it is problematic, and it’s a bit strange, actually. The government, somehow, will identify a first municipality, which is one or each of the 99 municipalities that currently receives gas tax funding for transit; the bill doesn’t say which one. The government then expresses the population of a second municipality that doesn’t receive gas tax money as a fraction of the population of the first. The government also expresses the length of highways in the second municipality as a fraction of the length of highways in the first. And then the total gas tax funding for the second municipality is equal to the gas tax funding flowing to the first municipality, times the population factor, times the highway-length factor. This is almost like the federal government putting up a formula for electoral reform. It’s an awkward formula. It is awkward. It is not straightforward.", "Quite honestly, for us, it doesn’t solve the problem of rural and northern municipalities being unfairly underfunded around infrastructure. I think that we do share the concerns of this member. Since the formula introduces this new variable, which has to do with highway length, which is missing from the current municipal gas tax funding formula, and since the government has 99 different first municipalities to choose from, I have no idea how much any second municipality would actually receive under this formula. So while I do appreciate the fact that this member has consistently brought a sense of fairness around the gas tax to the floor of the Legislature, unfortunately, the way that this private member’s bill is crafted does not allow us to support it at this time.", "But we do want to make it very clear that what really is needed is a reliable and equitable transit and infrastructure funding stream so that all municipalities have access to infrastructure funding. This has been a consistent ask of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. It comes up consistently, with some passion and some anger, I may add, at ROMA. So we are more than willing to work, on a go-forward perspective, towards a solution, but it does not appear that this government is very interested in listening to that, because the current system is inherently unfair to rural and northern communities." ],

Would you reduce gas tax funding for existing municipalities? Is that what would you would do, or would you raise the gas tax? What would the choice be from the member opposite?", "Here’s the interesting thing: Every time I turn around in Mississauga now I find his colleagues.

So he has proposed a formula to help fund that infrastructure that is needed to provide a more coherent transportation network for rural communities in this province.", "The formula he has proposed is to divide up that approximately $300 million that is generated in gas tax funding every year—to divide that up even further to more municipalities across the province. While we certainly support the intent of this bill—we certainly support appropriate, adequate transportation infrastructure in this province—we do have concerns about diluting that funding that is currently available to communities, to municipalities, to fund public transit systems.", "I want to talk about my own community of London. London is an urban centre, but it is surrounded by many, many smaller rural communities, all of which do not have public transit systems. So I can sympathize with the member’s concerns. However, within southwestern Ontario there has been an emerging realization that inter-city transportation, inter-community bus service, a regional transportation network, is what is needed. The mayors of southwestern Ontario are not advocating for a bigger share of the gas tax in order to fund that—no. They are calling on the government to show leadership in developing an integrated, multi-modal public transportation master plan for southwestern Ontario, in partnership with the government of Canada, with all southwestern Ontario municipalities and with public transportation service providers: VIA, Metrolinx and the Ontario Motor Coach Association that serve the region.", "Within southwestern Ontario, we used to have bus service that linked all of these communities, that linked small communities like Thorndale, Lucan, Exeter, Parkhill and Dorchester. All of these small communities were able to access bus service to come into the city of London to access the services that they needed. However, those bus services became no longer profitable for the operators, and as a result, we have hundreds of what are called ghost routes. Greyhound owns the licences for those ghost routes but is not running buses on those routes because it’s simply not profitable.", "The Mayors of Southwest Ontario, the Western Ontario Wardens’ Caucus, many of our municipalities—the city of Oxford and certainly the city of London—have been calling on the government of Ontario to show some leadership in trying to get those ghost routes back into service, to provide that transportation network that is so vitally needed in southwestern Ontario. Not just in my region, of course—every region in this province should benefit from a highly linked, integrated public transportation system.", "We certainly support, as I said, the intent of this bill to help fund some of that transportation infrastructure, but the proposed solution that is brought forward in this bill is simply not the answer. We don’t want to dilute that $300 million that’s available any further. We need to add to the budget that is available for transportation systems in this province.", "The other thing that the southwestern Ontario mayors are advocating for is a mechanism to enable cities to pool their funds together to develop a regional approach. This is something that we have not seen from this government. I know that they’ve spoken to the Minister of Transportation about the need for this. Municipalities want to work together. They want to have a network transportation system, but at this point, we have not seen the leadership that is necessary from the province to allow that regional transportation structure to be developed and implemented in communities across this province." ],

The list just goes on and on. We could talk about the industrial wind turbines that were forced upon unwilling host communities. We could talk about the closure of rural schools. We could talk about the skyrocketing hydro rates throughout the province that hit rural people particularly hard. We could talk about when we heard a minister toy with the idea of phasing out natural gas for home heating.", "Then we could talk about the unfairness that we’re focused on today with regard to how this Liberal government seemingly thinks it’s okay for people throughout this province to pay a gas tax, but only 100 municipalities—to be exact, 100 urban municipalities—can benefit from this particular gas tax rebate.", "I can tell you: In my riding, the 14 municipalities, which are all rural and do not have any source of public transportation or transit, are up against it very tough. They are realizing the stress associated with the decrease in OMPF funding. They are realizing the stress of a government that is whittling away and eroding the funding that they need to make ends meet in a rural municipality.", "The fact of the matter is that they’re having enough. They said, “Do you know what? We are done with this tired old Liberal government. We need a fresh start.” They need a government in Ontario that they can trust will be a faithful working partner, because I can tell you, I have municipalities in my riding that are saying, “How are we going to do this? How are we going to find the money to repair the bridge we need?” And guess what? Their only option is to close the road, because at the end of the day, they don’t have the money because of all the cuts that we’re seeing from this Liberal government.", "Do you know what’s worse, Speaker? I was actually taken aback and very disappointed when, moments ago, a member opposite—when my colleague mentioned that the gas rebate is doubling to municipalities with urban transit, she clapped. She cheered. She applauded, saying, “That’s great: double the money coming back to my municipality.” Well, Speaker, that is an absolute slap in the face to not only the rural municipalities in my riding, but to every single rural riding in Ontario. That is not acceptable in this House.", "We are the party in Ontario that actually gets it.

I remember we were here in debate last year on a completely different piece of legislation, and I was listening at that point to members of the NDP caucus speak. At that point, when I spoke, I talked a little bit about their sort of convenient mythology around a particular issue that they were discussing at that time. Listening very closely to members from the PC caucus, I see that that sickness, that disease, that had afflicted members of the third party has now migrated to the official opposition caucus.", "In every single community that I visit in this province—as much as I respect the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke because I know he’s an advocate for his community, particularly around issues like four-laning of certain highways, and I had a great meeting with him in his community on this issue—in every community that I visit or every community that I meet with as Minister of Transportation, I am told repeatedly, and have been for nearly three years, that the single most cataclysmic event that was brought to bear against those communities in rural and northern Ontario was the decision of the then-Conservative government to massively download the exact same infrastructure that this member purports to want to support with an expansion of the gas tax program. So I have to say it’s unfortunate that none of the members on that side of the House seem to recall exactly how debilitating that one short-sighted decision was for the communities that they claim they are proud to represent.", "A couple of other things I should point out about the gas tax program—and this is really important. The day the Premier and I announced that we would be doubling the gas tax money, I said in my remarks that communities from across Ontario today, 99 communities, from Wawa to Windsor—and then I went on from there. We have communities like Blind River. We have communities like Wawa. We have a bunch of other communities that are similar in size. I think the smallest community, by population, that currently receives gas tax support from the province has a population of less than 3,000 people. The good news about the provincial gas tax program is that there’s no bar to entry based on population size. It simply means that a municipality has to make an investment on its own in what qualifies as public transit. We don’t limit that. The fact that we have 99 communities today that qualify is the single-largest number of eligible communities in the program’s history. That tells me that more and more communities, including in northern and rural Ontario, are actually investing—in some cases in smaller ways, because that’s the capacity they have—in what is deemed to be public transit so that they can get that support. In the case of those even smaller communities, their support from our provincial gas tax program will grow over the next four years.", "The other part that I know members on the government side try our best to remind members in the PC caucus in particular about is that it’s not telling the whole story to suggest that, over the last 13 or 14 years, municipalities in rural and northern Ontario have not benefited greatly. Every member on this side of the House knows that since 2003, we have uploaded nearly $4 billion in costs from communities that were hard hit by a lot of the decisions that were made prior to 2003.", "In addition to that, I’ve had the privilege of visiting communities all over the east, the southwest and the north, and we continue to invest in the critical transportation infrastructure they need through programs like the OCIF, which has grown, and not just grown in the total amount that’s provided, but grown in the amount that is provided by formula.", "So with all of that, I won’t be supporting this particular legislation, but I look forward—" ],

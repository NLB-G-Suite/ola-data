Of course, Mr. Speaker, you will know that in 2017 we have a balanced budget, the first balanced budget since the global recession. Not only are we balancing the budget this year, but we’re on track to do so again next year and the year after.", "What’s so important is that a balanced budget means more funding for the programs and services people rely on most. Those that come to mind immediately are health care and education, but also this budget contains some very exciting news for the clients that my ministry, the Ministry of Community and Social Services, serves. So I’m going to focus my remarks on some of those provisions in this budget.", "For those with developmental disabilities, we’re making an investment of more than $670 million over four years. This will provide another 375 additional residential developmental services placements for individuals with urgent needs and for youth transitioning from the child welfare system.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m sure you’re aware that sometimes families and caregivers find adults with developmental disabilities challenging in terms of their needs. Sometimes it’s complex medical needs; sometimes it’s behavioural issues. We, unfortunately, do see people sometimes accommodated inappropriately in hospital and in long-term-care facilities. So this investment will make a tremendous difference in terms of more appropriately housing those individuals.", "We will be expanding our Passport Program yet again. We have some 24,000 people now on that particular program, and this funding will expand the supports available to those individuals.", "We’re also doing some work in terms of specialized clinical responses for individuals with complex special needs, working very closely with the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. We, on this side of the House, have an excellent team approach in terms of interministerial work. My ministry works closely with the Ministry of Children and Youth Services as well as the Ministry of Education to ensure that individuals with developmental disabilities get the care they need. In many cases, it’s very individualized support that is needed, and we work together to ensure that we have a plan for individuals with developmental disabilities.", "We’ve been able to increase asset limits, where families are able to contribute more in terms of their loved one’s care. In other words, we are not expecting them to deplete any assets before eligibility for the Ontario Disability Support Program comes into place. This was a result of extensive consultations we did with families, caregivers and individuals across the province. We heard loud and clear that families want to be part of the support of their loved ones with developmental disabilities.", "We have received a number of endorsements for our approach in this budget. I’m going to quote from Bryan Keshen. He’s president and CEO of Reena. I’m sure many of us have come to know Bryan as a great advocate for those with developmental disabilities.", "As Bryan says, “I am pleased to see an expanded investment in services through the Ministry of Community and Social Services for those in crisis and in transition to adult services. I am particularly thrilled to see the recognition and investment in interministerial efforts with expanded housing, support for caregivers, and health services targeted to the most vulnerable populations of which those with developmental disabilities are disproportionately represented.” This is the type of endorsement we are receiving from across the sector.", "Of course, we have an increase to ODSP rates as well that will benefit those with developmental disabilities, because, in fact, of all the people on ODSP, some 20% have a developmental disability.", "This is just a small part of our budget 2017-18—a very important part. I urge all members of this House, of course, to support this investment and these very vital services for vulnerable Ontarians." ],

I was very happy last Friday to be at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario to make an announcement with regard to newborn screening—actually, a lot more things than just newborn screening. We described it as the baby budget.", "The most important part of the budget for me is OHIP+ pharmacare for children and youth 24 and under. If you live in Renfrew-Nipissing, and you’re 24 years old or under, you will be able to go to your pharmacist after January 1—if we can pass this budget bill, which I’m sure we can get done before we rise this summer. You go to the pharmacy, you go with your script, you go with your OHIP card and you’ll leave with your prescription—no cost, no deductible, no copay.", "I’ve heard from pharmacists and physicians and nurses about the challenge that some families have in paying for their prescriptions. We know that pharmaceuticals and medicines have evolved rapidly over the last 20 or 30 years. They have evolved rapidly since the beginning of medicare, and they’re a significant component of what people need to get well.", "This measure in the budget is a game-changer, not only for what it will do for families in Ontario: families with children suffering with diabetes, families with children who are suffering from mental illness—I could go on and on.", "The other important thing about this measure in the budget is, we need to have a national pharmacare plan. We need to have that conversation. We need to get to universal coverage." ],

It’s critical because medicines are essential to people getting well. We know that. We know that it’s a struggle, and we know that we have to do more to make sure people have access to medicines.", "Speaker, I was also pleased to announce two new screens for newborn screening. As most of the members in this Legislature would know, since 2006, we expanded the screens for newborn babies. These are screens for a range of diseases, genetic diseases and a number of other medical conditions. We have expanded that now to 31. We added two new additional screens. We now screen more than any other province. I think we’re the jurisdiction that screens the most in North America as well.", "We added a screening for congenital heart disease. About 400 to 500 babies each year are born with a congenital heart defect. That could be a really serious situation for a family to be in. The challenge is that sometimes they might not find out for a week, two weeks, maybe a few months or maybe longer, and that puts that child at risk. This test will now identify early those defects so that they can be properly treated. They’ll have a better chance at having a healthy outcome, a brighter future.", "Actually, I was joined by the member from Ottawa Centre, the Attorney General, whose son, Rafi, was actually in the same unit that we visited on Friday. It was a very emotional time for him. I’m very proud of the fact that we have newborn screening, that it’s housed at CHEO, and of the work that Dr. Pranesh Chakraborty and his team do there on newborn screening. They screen every baby in Ontario—since 2006, 1.5 million babies. That’s incredible.", "We also talked about a supplemental test for hearing, to augment the tests and the work that we already do. This test will, again, early identify children, babies who are at a potential for hearing loss, and be able to make sure that they get the assistance, the literacy they need, to make sure that they have a better chance at having a healthier outcome. I’m very proud of those two new tests and the fact that where that’s being done is in my riding of Ottawa South. I’m very proud of the work they do at newborn screening.", "As well, we announced—as part of the baby budget—up to 90 new midwives to practise here in Ontario. Our oldest daughter, Kïrsten, had our latest addition to the family Fraser almost a year ago in a couple of weeks. I remember we got called to come over to the house. She had a midwife, Kelley Scott. We got called to come over to the house. We got there at about 10 o’clock in the morning. We took Vaughan, who is her oldest son, to the Teddy Bears’ Picnic at CHEO. This is about 10 o’clock. We stayed until about 1 o’clock, came back, put Vaughan down for his nap. I went for a nap too because I was exhausted. I was lying on the couch.", "My daughter went in at 9 o’clock in the morning. She came in the door at 3 o’clock in the afternoon, woke me up and she was at the door. I thought, “My gosh, it was a false alarm.” Well, no. It wasn’t a false alarm, because she was bringing a Fraser into the house.", "That’s an incredible thing, an incredible choice for families and mothers who are having children, to be able to have access to midwives, to be home the same day, to birth at home or to birth at the Ottawa birthing centre in my riding. That’s an incredible thing for a lot of moms. I’m very proud that we made that investment in the budget and look forward to seeing the further expansion of midwifery in Ontario.", "We also announced pumps for preemies, which is breast pumps for women who have had premature babies. That will help those babies to thrive so they’ll have access to their mother’s breast milk. I’m very proud of that program as well. Also our support for the milk bank, which I think is just across the way over here on University Avenue. It’s been going for a number of years. I think they’ve gone through 4,000 litres that they’ve provided up until now.", "One of the other investments was in BORN, which is the Better Outcomes Registry and Network. Every child that is born in Ontario is now followed by the Better Outcomes Registry and Network. That’s for a number of things. It’s closely aligned with newborn screening.", "One of the investments that they made was to collect better data on pregnancy and infant loss. I know this is something that’s very dear to the heart of the member from Eglinton–Lawrence. I was proud of the fact that we made some investments in last year’s budget to address that. Many families are touched by this type of loss. We need to talk about it more. We need to have better data, better understanding, so that the health care providers can ensure that mothers and families who are experiencing these losses have access to the proper supports.", "The investment in being able to collect that data—and, indeed, all the work that BORN does; I think there are over a million children right now—is really critical to better outcomes for children. It’s not exciting, necessarily—a new medicine or a new procedure—but it’s a very effective way of ensuring that we can deliver the kind of care that we need to, by understanding what the population needs are. And the only way that you can do that is to collect data. I’m very proud of that investment.", "As well, hospital capital: We’re investing another $9 billion over 10 years, to $20 billion for hospital capital. This is really important. We all talk in debate here and in question period about the hospitals and health care facilities in our ridings, and those investments—for instance in Ottawa we’ve got Project Stitch at CHEO, which is an expansion of ambulatory care. We have a brand new heart institute, which should be finished some time later this year or early next year. Those things are critical to ensure that the people in our communities get the care that they need. I know that I’m very proud of that investment.", "In particular there were a couple of things in the budget—and you wouldn’t necessarily see them, because they didn’t come on a big page with a big diagram—that for me were personally very satisfying to see there because of some of the work I’ve been fortunate enough to be allowed to do as a parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Health. That has to do with hospice and palliative care.", "Let me say at the outset I’m very proud to work with all members in this Legislature who advocate for hospice and palliative care in their communities, all those who really go above and beyond to support that in their communities, beyond their role as legislators in this chamber and in their other work. I want to say thank you to all those members for their support and for the work they do for something that I think is really critical and important for the people we all serve.", "When I had the opportunity to do some consultations around hospice and meet many people across the province—great people who are doing great work—one of the things that occurred to me is that hospice palliative care is a community-based initiative that government supports. That’s a critical piece of what makes it work. It’s a critical piece of its development. That community support also adds in things like affinity, volunteerism and an understanding of the need.", "But we realize that not all communities are equal, and that we need to find a way to support hospice in the sense of capital. Hospice is right now a capital investment by a community, by a fundraising effort, often through multiple members inside the community, thousands of people coming together like they did for Roger’s House, Ruddy-Shenkman Hospice in Ottawa and Matthews House in Alliston. But we realize that not all communities are equal, so in the budget you’ll find—I don’t know what page it’s on; I was trying to find it—that there is going to be support for capital dollars for hospice.", "I’m very proud of that work that’s been done by the ministry to find a way to make sure that we can help communities further leverage the support they have in their community and get their hospices up and done and running. Hopefully in the next number of weeks we’ll be able to announce that. I can’t give you details right now. I’m very proud of that piece, that it’s in there and the work that has been done by the folks who I’m privileged to work with inside the ministry.", "The other piece is an investment around long-term care and palliative care. Long-term care is home. As we know, most people would like to die at home, and we need to treat long-term care as home. There is some real excellence in palliative care happening in long-term care across this province. I’ve been lucky to have met a number of people and toured a number of homes where they’re really doing an excellent job.", "But we know we have to deliver that everywhere. Inside the budget, you’ll see it—again, it’s on a line; it’s on a page with a bunch of graphs. We are going to invest in ensuring that we can have quality palliative care across all of our long-term-care homes in Ontario. I think that that’s, again, a really critical piece.", "Speaker, I’m very proud of the measures in this budget. You know, I did start this—well, some people might say I’m rambling, but I did start this discourse—" ],

The federal government has to come to the table. They have to be at the table, because it’s critical that we’re all together to ensure that we can get the best cost for our pharmaceuticals, make sure that we have universal coverage, bring us all together around this thing that is really, as has been described, the second stage of medicare.

It started as a volunteer hospice associated with the Catholic church in the municipality of Merrickville-Wolford.", "They now, as of this month, just opened their forever home. It was a home that had been donated to the hospice. It’s a rather large facility. I had the pleasure of touring that facility with the member for Ottawa South last summer, and I want to thank him for taking time to drive down to North Grenville and seeing the facility. I think he told me it took him about five or 10 minutes to zip down; maybe more.", "That particular facility is sort of at a crossroads now. They’ve dealt with the Champlain LHIN for a number of years. There has been this undercurrent about governance that I hope is resolved between Hospice Care Ottawa and the management of the Beth Donovan Hospice.", "When I was elected in March 2010, shortly after my election, Beth Donovan passed away. I can remember going to Smiths Falls for her wake and speaking to her family about the importance of her legacy and the importance of ensuring that residents of the municipalities of North Grenville and Merrickville-Wolford have that opportunity to have a hospice where they can die with dignity and where they know that there are volunteers and officials who can provide that good level of care.", "I look forward to having more conversations with the member for Ottawa South about the Beth Donovan Hospice.

We have residential homes that are under providers that are being forced to send in balanced budgets even though they’re struggling to balance those budgets. We know that those balanced budgets will only come down to one thing, and that means cuts to the home, to the staffing levels, to whatever the needs are in that home.", "You can’t force a balanced budget when you have an increased cost of hydro, when you have mandated pay equity, when you have all of these things being forced on top of you and then you’re being told that you have to hand in a balanced budget. It just doesn’t work.", "Thank you for the extra dollars. They will help some families. But there is way too much in this system that will still fall behind.", "I want to mention the member from Ottawa South. He talked about the strategies coming in for new babies. People with FASD—we know that there are dollars going into FASD, but the community is still unhappy. I’ve heard from them directly about the lack of an integrated strategy to go with those dollars.

I’m glad that this budget invests in organizations like the Reena Foundation.", "I also want to comment on the member from Ottawa South, who talked about investing in newborn screening and adding two more to the 31 screens we already have. That is more than you can get in any other province. It doesn’t even exist in the United States.", "By doing newborn screening, you can have our expert doctors start to take remedial actions to deal with the diagnosed genetic screens. I think he mentioned the new screening for hearing. I had friends who had a child that had a hearing impairment. They didn’t really find out that the child had a hearing impairment until the child was almost two years of age, because it’s sometimes a very complex thing, being a parent trying to—if they had had that early screening of that child, they could have taken action. As you know, right now, one of the amazing scientific investments they make is in cochlear implants, where they can make an implant at a very early age in a child so the child almost functions normally from a hearing perspective.", "These screening investments are, again, the best in North America.

For the people who are watching this perhaps on their television sets at home, I should clarify that. That is the choking off of debate, the ending of debate or the government allocating how much time there shall be for the debate on a piece of legislation. We are operating in this Legislative Assembly at this time almost exclusively on what are called time allocation motions. That’s most unfortunate, because it’s what you would call anti-democratic.”", "“Anti-democratic.” “Choking off of debate”—" ],

They don’t want to hear opposition members stand up and talk about how terribly bad this government has handled our electricity sector, on how bad they’ve done in terms of listening to the customer service complaints and the billing complaints and the metering complaints. We had to bring in the Ombudsman, for goodness’ sake, when André Marin was here. We had to actually, as members of the Legislature, call the Ombudsman and refer constituent complaints because we couldn’t get any action by this government and couldn’t get any action by Hydro One. It’s unbelievable.", "When the government provides some measures regarding hydro—they’re all in when it comes to advertisements, but they wait until last Thursday to even bother tabling the bill, and then when they do, they immediately move to choke off debate. They had debate yesterday and now we’re dealing with this block button today by this government.", "Mr. Bradley goes on to say in his speech on December 11, 2001: “The best way to deal with legislation is to have the government sitting most of the year so that it can receive careful analysis and debate in this House and in committees and, in fact, in committees that travel across the province to get meaningful input. We do not have that.”", "Speaker, Jim Bradley is right. We certainly don’t have that with this time allocation motion. To have one day of hearings for seven hours, then to have one day of clause-by-clause and then to come back for a half an hour of debate at third reading? A 30-minute debate? This is supposed to be the government’s flagship plan on hydro, and it’s only good enough for 30 minutes of debate?", "We used to have meaningful debate in this Legislature where we were actually able to provide comments, work through committee, be able to amend a bill and be able to take what we heard. In fact, this government employed it last summer briefly, with Bill 201 at the time, for financing reform for donations. We actually went out at first reading. I think a bill like this would have been great if the government had had that type of debate instead of having their ad campaign. I think it would have been a measure that people would have welcomed.", "Time after time, this government hits the block button when it comes to listening to people. I want to go back to a quote that Jim Bradley, the member for St. Catharines, made on November 24, 1993. His quote is this, Speaker:", "“I’m concerned about the closure motions because I think they limit legitimate debate. I recognize that a government ultimately might have the opportunity to close down a debate that’s been going on a very long period of time. But as I’ve indicated to the House in days gone by, the purpose of these debates is to canvass public opinion, to make the public aware of what is happening.”", "He goes on to say, “All of us have experienced the situation where we have encountered our constituents and they’ve said, ‘What is this particular bill all about?’ or ‘How did this bill get passed and I didn’t know anything about it?’ They are legitimate questions. One of the reasons is that the bills tend to get passed very rapidly in this House.”", "Again, I agree with Jim Bradley from November 24, 1993.", "I’m not going to read out another quote that he made in 2001. But at the end of the quote, he talks about the most powerful person in government, and he says that that’s the whip, the chief government whip. That was his quote: that the government whip can tell their members when to show up, when to vote. It’s just so ironic, Speaker, that the person that the member for St. Catharines railed about when he was in opposition was in the position he holds today. I can’t believe that in that short a period of time, he has turned around.", "I think we had, and we continue to have, a great opportunity to provide comments, suggestions, questions, to canvass public opinion, to allow our constituents to provide good, meaningful, thoughtful comments on government legislation, but not when this government hits the block button and doesn’t want to hear those voices—when this government decides that it knows better than Ontarians. I think that type of attitude is really going to come home to roost for this government in about a year’s time. I think that their strategy for their whip and their House leader and their House leader’s staff is the wrong strategy for Ontarians. I can’t emphasize enough that the opportunity to have meaningful debate without cutting off debate—without choking off debate, as the member for St. Catharines stated over and over again—is the way to go.", "Speaker, we not only have a closure motion on the order paper for Bill 132, but we also have one, motion number 29, for Bill 87, which I’m sure the government will be calling in order. I wouldn’t be surprised if they did it later on today.", "Again, it’s surprising how the voices of Ontarians don’t matter to this government anymore, that they could care less about when we sit. Any time we want to debate, any time we want to put those comments on the floor of this Legislature, we get accused of delaying.", "Remember what I said earlier, Speaker. Remember what I said in this time allocation motion: 30 minutes for third reading debate, seven hours for public hearings, five minutes for a constituent to come—in my case, in my riding, to drive three hours to Toronto for five minutes. Come on, Speaker; that’s not meaningful debate. That’s not a government that wants to hear those voices. It’s a sham. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. It’s going to come back on you." ],

I would think they’re probably not going to find much in there that they like, considering the government is saying they’re cutting bills by 25%, but we know that bills have gone up 300% since 2000.", "We know that the people of this province, over 80%, don’t support the fact that the government is selling off our public asset.

This government doesn’t want the people of this province to know that, and that’s shameful.", "This government has had 14 years to do something about electricity prices. This government, when the rates went up, when things started to skyrocket, actually said, “There is no crisis in hydro. There’s nothing going on. People aren’t really struggling. We don’t need to do anything. In fact, we can just keep charging ahead with the privatization of Hydro One.”", "They denied there was a problem.

I’m still getting them; I’m still getting people sending me their bills.", "They could have done something about it then.

That can’t be right. Those people can’t be right. There is no problem.”", "What they’re doing today is trying to shut down our opportunity to say, “This plan that you have brought forward is not a good plan.” In fact, the people who are already struggling to pay their hydro bills are going to have even more of a struggle just four short years down the road.

You heard the minister and the Premier yesterday, saying, “Oh, but that’s an old document.” They only came out in March with the plan to reduce hydro rates by a further 17%, spending your money and your children’s and grandchildren’s money to do it. It only came out in March, and that leaked cabinet document was only prepared in response to that decision because it was designed to show the government what the consequences of that decision would be and how they would have to recoup that money down the road and to give them various options about how they would deal with that. If that is not a significant piece of information—and all of a sudden now, because the Liberals don’t like what was revealed in the document, “Oh, it’s an old document.” What is old? What is old in this House? If somebody has been here 40 years, they’ve been here a long time, like Mr. Bradley. Forty years: That’s a long time, but is he old? I don’t know about that.

If they get a majority, it’s going to be the same old thing all over again. Mark my words on this, Speaker: If the Liberals win the election in June 2018 and if they win a majority, all of those concerns—the 61% increase in hydro, the return of a debt retirement charge, the massive increases of people’s monthly bills—it’s not going to take four years or six years for that to happen; it will happen shortly after they’re re-elected, because—you know what they will do? They will change the legislation to get back at the people sooner than was planned, just like when they promised there would never be a health tax and, when they got elected in 2003, they brought in the biggest tax in Canada’s history, ever—ever. They brought in the biggest tax increase in Canada’s history. So I say to the people: If you re-elect this government, watch out.

As you’re well aware, Speaker, the Liberal government is about to incur a liability in order to get through the next election, a liability on behalf of the people of Ontario of $40 billion—$40 billion. We’re not talking small change here; we’re talking about significant cost. Just as a comparison, the total debt of Ontario was calculated to be $332.4 billion as of March 31 of this year, so we’re talking about an expenditure that will be more than 10% of the value of the total of the province’s debt.", "Given the scale of that, you would think that this would be a discussion that would go on for some time. This is a substantial debate. This isn’t a minor item. We’re not talking about dog-walking parks. We’re not talking about Bring Your MPP to Work day. We’re talking about real substance here.", "Instead of having proper public consultations, extended debate and hearings in different parts of the province for something that is not inconsequential, what we have is a time allocation motion before us that allows public hearings for one day; that’s going to be May 24, from 10 a.m. to noon and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.", "In order to let people know about this—this consequential day, the only day they’re going to get—there will be notices posted on the Ontario parliamentary channel and the Legislative Assembly’s website. There will be a note put out on Canada NewsWire—not bad things, Speaker, but, frankly, it is fairly common in this place to actually put ads in newspapers to let people know that something substantial is going to be debated. There’s going to be none of that.", "In fact, today is the 16th. The time for requesting an opportunity to speak will be up this Friday at 1 p.m. That’s it. Let’s assume this gets passed today and let’s say there’s going to be a vote after question period tomorrow. So, Wednesday afternoon there will be notification, maybe Wednesday afternoon, maybe Thursday, and by Friday at 1 p.m, that’s it—cut off. People can’t get on the list to speak before a parliamentary committee to actually put forward their assessment. Then, after that, there will be approximately a day for debating clause-by-clause before this comes back for—I think it’s 20 minutes per party to discuss the bill at third reading.", "We’re talking about a very substantial decision that will give this government a number of years of reduced prices and a reduction in the political heat on hydro and give the people of Ontario a massive hangover: 26 years of soaring bills, bills that, after this four-year interlude is over, will go up sharply and will plateau, substantially higher than we otherwise would have paid. It’s not a minor decision.", "This party, we in the NDP, talked to the Liberals a few months ago, raised this question in question period, and said, “You know, you shouldn’t leave this to the last minute. This is of consequence. This is of consequence.” I can only think that, two months ago, the government House leader and the Premier knew that this session would come to an end. I suspect they had access to the parliamentary calendar. They knew that June 1 was probably going to be the last day of the session, so they knew that their time was limited and, if they were going to have a full public debate on a substantial matter, that they should bring it forward. Yet they left this major financial decision to the last eight sessional days, and they are now jamming it through with this time allocation motion.", "I can only think, Speaker—and I think it’s the only logical explanation—that they understand that they don’t want any public scrutiny on this: as little as they can possibly get away with. You can understand it: They’re operating in a threatening political environment. Their polling numbers are way down. They have an election coming up in a year, that doesn’t promise to go well for them. There’s this desperate need to pour oil on the waters—about an Exxon Valdez-worth of oil—calm it down.", "They have a plan that exudes an unpleasant odour whenever it’s poked, one that people notice. So when you put a whole province in hock to get through an election, you can expect that it may not be well received when people actually get to go through the numbers and the details. When you ignore a profound problem, when you ignore the roots of that problem and decide that the way you’re going to approach it is to pave it over with bundles of $20 bills—bundles of $100 bills—you can expect that the public won’t respond that well when they actually get to scrutinize, when they actually get to hear exactly what is on offer and how it’s going to affect them. You want it left alone, in the dark, undisturbed by human hands, and that is exactly what this time allocation motion is about.", "Speaker, they want this left in the dark until the revamped hydro bills show up at people’s homes. As you may well understand, this bill gives the government the power to rewrite those hydro bills, so the Premier herself can dictate what your hydro bill is going to look like.", "You can bet that there will be a prominent line on the bill saying this is the amount you saved because the Premier, in her infinite wisdom, stepped in to save you from hardships, not noting that she herself was a significant player in causing those hardships. But we will see that.", "Speaker, I wouldn’t be surprised if each hydro bill didn’t come with one of those little computer chips that you get in birthday cards that play a little song, so that when you open that bill, you’ll hear this blare of trumpets, and you will see before you—behold her great works—“I cut your bill by 20 bucks.”" ],

That is a big chunk of what’s going on here.", "Speaker, you can be certain that on these rewritten hydro bills, there won’t be a line that says, “And in a few years, you’re going to be paying all this back.” There won’t be a line saying, “For every dollar that’s reduced today, you’ll be paying back $2 tomorrow.” They won’t be saying that you’ll be paying this bill at a very high rate. You get my drift.", "Jamming this bill through at the very last minute is completely typical of this government. It doesn’t like the idea that electricity plans get public scrutiny. It’s contrary to where they’re at.", "You may well know the history of electricity planning in Ontario. You may well know that at one point—and they were called demand/supply hearings—there was a process that required public presentation before a tribunal, with the ability to have those plans scrutinized and have the decision-makers cross-examined, and an opportunity to actually dig deep and see what was on offer.", "That was at one point, Speaker. That got abandoned when the Liberals came to power in 2003. They brought forward another process. They restricted that process, and they made it tighter. But they still required that a plan be brought forward by the government of the day that would go to the Ontario Energy Board, where, again, at a tribunal, the decision-makers would be subjected to cross-examination by interveners and interested stakeholders.", "Speaker, that matters. In the late 1980s, early 1990s, there was a lot of talk about building three, four, five more nuclear reactors in Ontario.

Tapping the wisdom of the people is a good thing for a society: listening to people, giving an opportunity to them to actually get down into the nuts and bolts of a decision and thinking and looking for the errors, looking for the opportunities, and improving that plan.", "I think everyone in this chamber would agree that it’s always better to have the public brought in to hear their commentary—it doesn’t matter whether you like it or not, but to have as many good minds as possible focused in on what’s going on, so that you can get the best possible decision.", "This government doesn’t particularly like that. It came forward with its integrated power supply plan, which to my knowledge, Speaker, never had a full hearing. That was replaced by the long-term energy plan. At each stage, the amount of public scrutiny was made smaller and smaller and smaller, until at this point we have a system in which the government goes out and asks people what they think, but doesn’t actually present them with a plan that they can critique. And so you’ve got things turned on their heads: the public trying to understand where things should go, put forward their best thoughts—that’s a good thing, that’s a positive development—but they don’t actually get to question the product that eventually comes out of the government.", "This plan before us, this bill, will have limited hearings. There will be no opportunity for intervenors to question the Minister of Energy or any of his officials. There will be a very limited window for hearings, a very limited window for debate. In fact, that’s happening right now. We’re debating cutting off debate. I don’t think that’s a good idea. I think it’s a mistake. Then when we get to third reading after the limited public hearings, after the greatly reduced time for going through the bill on a clause-by-clause basis, what have we got? Something like 20 minutes per party to speak about the bill at the end.", "I would say, Speaker, that you and most people in this country wouldn’t think that’s very democratic. It may follow the letter of the law, but it certainly violates the spirit of the law, without any doubt.", "This year’s long-term energy plan, I understood, would be coming forward in the spring—well, February is not spring; March, April—and that there would be an opportunity while the House was in session, even with all the limitations the government has put on it, to actually have some discussion, maybe not formally in this chamber, but while we’re all here, an opportunity to go through the numbers, critique the plan and talk to the media. Increasingly, what I’m hearing from the government—and I look forward to hearing whether my sense of it is correct or not—is that it’s going to be a few more months before it comes forward: I would say, given everything that has happened before, probably at 6 p.m. on June 30.", "Given that July 1 is a national holiday, I would say that with their habits, 6 p.m. on June 30 would make complete sense. Bring it forward in the summer while people are away. Let it vaporize in the media for a few hours and then be gone. So the ability of the people of this province to critique what’s going on is dramatically limited.", "The bill before us is one that borrows a large amount of cash to make bills look good in the year going up to an election and sticks the people of the province with tens of billions of dollars in debt that they’ll have to pay for years. It’s a bill that reduces the oversight of our regulator. As weak as that oversight may be, it is weakened even further.", "This is not a bill that is in the interest of the people of Ontario.

I find it so hard to believe because their constituents sent them here for some reason, Mr. Speaker; for some reason they sent them here.", "Members have a right to debate matters before the House, but this government this time is proposing to borrow $27.7 billion in new debt and store it at Ontario Power Generation—which, keep in mind, has never happened before. We’ve never seen anything like this in North America. Then they’re going to recoup the debt, the interest, and whatever new fees and commissions—they’re going to pass them on to electricity customers down the road.", "We’ve never done anything like this in the province of Ontario. This government expects us to ram it home in just a couple of hours of debate, in a couple of days, with no scrutiny. And they don’t have the answers themselves. They don’t have the answers to our questions—very, very valid questions—on how in the heck we’re ever going to pay for this.", "Even when the government time-allocated the budget earlier this week, at least the House had complete information on financial statements that it was being asked to vote for. Here, the only financial information we have on this bill—this massive $28-billion bill—came from a whistle-blower. That’s the only information we have: from a whistle-blower. Somebody over there, who isn’t elected, understands what this bill is all about: $28 billion. I want you to try and wrap your head around that for a minute.", "The government first decided to dispute whether the document that we got from the whistle-blower was real. Then, after being challenged on that, they changed their argument, and suddenly the document was real but it was out of date. But have we seen any new numbers or up-to-date numbers?", "The government’s public position is that the only financial information that the members have on which to base an opinion is inaccurate. The government has provided no updated financial information to counter that document.", "When we spoke to ministry staff yesterday—and thank you for the briefing—they couldn’t tell us how much we were going to pay in interest. They couldn’t tell us who was creating the financial product—the bond that’s actually being sold—so we have no idea how much you’ll be paying bankers on your hydro bill for the next 30 years.", "Why is this important, Speaker? Because you don’t sell these things without a cost. What the budget tells us on page 240 is that we will have paid bankers over $188 million for the Hydro One sale.", "This is three times bigger than that—three times bigger than the Hydro One sale. That means that if you just take the cost of what we paid out to sell Hydro One and multiply it, Ontario ratepayers are going to end up paying more than a half-billion dollars in fees and commissions on their hydro bills for the next 30 years, and that’s only if you don’t count the interest in the total fees and commissions.", "At least when we sold Hydro One, at least when Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals sold Hydro One, something they campaigned against, that came out of general revenue. The structure of this legislation is such that the same is not possible here. Those costs have to be paid by OPG. Because that’s true, they’ll either be paid as part of the new debt retirement charge on steroids, which is what the legislation envisions, or they’ll be paid as part of an OPG rate application. In either case, you’ll have no choice but to pay for every last one of these expenses on your hydro bill.", "I want to give a sense of exactly what $27.7 billion buys you in the electricity system. You could refurbish Darlington twice. You could build the Lower Mattagami project 10 times. You could upgrade the entire 500 kV network, from the high-voltage, direct-current intertie with Quebec right into downtown Toronto, eight times with the money they’re blowing on this Liberal election platform. According to the customer that the government uses for their modelling, you could pay every hydro customer’s bill in this province for 34 months with the money they’re wasting on this deal, and we’ve got three days to look at it. It’s garbage. It’s arrogance. It’s unbelievable, is what it is.", "Ontarians will get not one electron of new power out of this bill. They’ll build not a single thing that will make the power system more reliable, more flexible or more carbon-free. What they’ll get is a massive new cost that will be with them until my kids, who are teenagers, are in their forties—a new cost for kids who are in their teens now when they’re in their forties. I’ll be 77 years old by that time, if I make it, Mr. Speaker. That’s what they’ll get out of this bill. The fact that we’re being asked to make that commitment on six hours of committee time and a half-hour debate at third reading is insulting to everyone who cast a ballot. It’s insulting to everyone who holds a seat in this House. It should be insulting for the backbenchers and the government members as well, because they don’t have the numbers themselves. They don’t have them.", "This brings me to the real focus of the debate this afternoon, which is time allocation. I’m not going to stand here and quote the member from St. Catharines and what he said over the last 40 years, because that would be embarrassing. It would be embarrassing for the actions of this government when you’re dealing with something as important as this is, and I have no idea how the members of the government have no understanding of the magnitude of this decision they’ve made.", "But I do think that the constant use of time allocation lowers the status of this place because it conveys only one message, and that’s what Ontarians already know: that this Premier doesn’t care to listen to them. The Premier doesn’t care what their opinion is. This Premier doesn’t care what the opposition says. Nearly every government bill which has passed in this session has faced time allocation, whether it was required or not. There exists no belief on the part of the government that the opposition can even contribute to legislation—none. Opposition amendments are rarely included at committee, and we have no reason to believe that they will be here, because they’re rushing it through in six hours of debate on a $28-billion borrowing scheme.", "This is the fundamental problem here. It’s not even that the government is diminishing the role of the House. It’s the fact that the government is refusing to give members essential information, and then asking them to make a decision on it, to blindly support something that they don’t even have answers for themselves. It’s arrogance: Vote on a $28-billion debt issue. Do so without essential information that shows the impact that it will have on ratepayers, and then do so with six hours of committee and a half-hour debate at third reading.", "I hate time allocation. I have never been in government. I hate time allocation, I really do, because it limits what we can do as elected members representing our constituents. I’d rather go home at night, but I’m stuck here Monday through Thursday. Many of the government members are not.", "But in the event that the roles are reversed a year from now, you had better hope that I am not sitting in the seat next to the government whip, acting as government House leader and dictating the schedule of this House, because I will keep you here every night until midnight. I will keep you here every night until midnight, because what the people who elected you sent you here to do was to properly scrutinize bills. You will not like it, but you will debate. You’ll never go home, but you’ll debate, because that’s the job that we were sent here to do.", "It’s a $28-billion bill, with a couple of hours of debate. That’s it.

I’ve sat with him here for years, and I can’t blame him for bringing passion to the debate, because it’s a reflection of what we’re hearing in our communities. It’s a reflection of the contempt that people back in our ridings have for this government and their actions in relation to not only hydro, but the general state of affairs when it comes to the finances of the province.", "Time and time again, when given the option to make the right decision, to do the right thing, to take the long road and to explain fully what it means to run a capable, competent and respectful government, they do the opposite. Today we see the effects of that: a time allocation motion that truncates debate on what could end up potentially being a $28-billion debt to generations to come for their mistakes on the hydro file.", "Speaker, it’s something that is hard to wrap your head around. For the general public, when we get into these large numbers and these big figures, they can’t understand that this type of money even exists, that a government can so freely and easily burden the people of this province with that much debt. And how can you blame them, Speaker?", "If folks take a look at the status of affairs right now—we know that hydro has never been more expensive in this province. That’s a direct relation to the actions on the part of the government. When it comes to their efforts to privatize the system, it has only increased the overall cost of the system.", "We see that reflected in the 2017 budget as well. If you look at the numbers for 2015 through 2016, 2016 through 2017, and 2017 through 2018, their efforts on the part of privatizing Hydro One will add $188 million just for the administrative costs. On the line item it says, “Transformation related to Hydro One: $188 million,” to accountants, to consultants, to people who are going to make a whole lot of money off of selling our most valuable asset.", "Speaker, we’ve counselled the government, we’ve implored them, to keep that asset public to ensure that the people who invested in our public utility continue to benefit from it; but to manage it accordingly, to make the reforms that are needed, to ensure that the CEO doesn’t make an exorbitant salary, and to ensure that rates are reasonable and competitive with other jurisdictions. But they have been asleep at the switch.", "And here we are today, where they find themselves in a precarious political position, where the Premier of the day has an approval rating lower than that of Donald Trump, even in Canada. Recent polling on the President of the United States as it relates to Canadians showed Donald Trump with a 16% approval rating; our current Premier has a 12% approval rating.", "There are more similarities than that low approval rating. There are more similarities between these two governments. We’re looking across the border, to our friends to the south, and we’re seeing a presidency that’s fraught with internal resistance, where folks that work in the White House for the current Trump administration are having to leak documents to warn the people of that country of some of the actions that are happening under his presidency.", "We’ve just seen that from this government. Some brave soul, whoever that person is, who had that cabinet document in their hands and decided “This information needs to get out”—I want to thank them. That’s a brave thing to do. It was an important thing to do. It should send shockwaves through this government that that’s the state of affairs now; that decisions are being made without proper consultation. I doubt the majority of the members of the government were fully briefed and fully informed on the ramifications of this bill, and to this day we see that none of them have any answers. They don’t have any answers as to how much this actually is going to cost. All we have to rely on are these leaked cabinet documents.", "We know some of the basics, Speaker, out of the bill. We know that oversight through our various oversight bodies will be reduced. It reduces the oversight through the regulators. That stands to reason, because while they privatize the system, they’ll want to water down any oversight for those private industries when they become the operator, as they become the overall manager and distributor of the system. They won’t want a government hanging over their shoulder. All the more reason for them to have sold off 60% of it.", "Now, I have to lay a little bit of criticism to our friends in the official opposition. They certainly are passionate about this debate and have come to the table defending our public utility, Hydro One, but their plan calls for selling 49% of that valuable asset, only 11% less than what the Liberals have currently sold off. So it’s difficult for me to connect the rationale on that side, because I can’t see any different of an action coming from the Conservatives.", "People in our communities are suffering. There’s absolutely no question about it. They continue to call our offices. They continue to express their dire situations in that nowadays their hydro utility bill is their largest expense. They can’t make ends meet and they’re struggling.", "Small businesses in my community of Windsor and Essex county have to make the decision as to whether to reduce their hours, to serve food, to grow food—we’ve got greenhouses in Leamington and Kingsville that are now making the clear decision—and it’s an easy decision for them to make, given the costs that have come down on them from this government—that they can no longer afford to grow in our communities. They’ve gone down south to Ohio and to Michigan and set up multi-million-dollar facilities, creating jobs and sustainability. That’s something that we’re missing out on, and it’s something that this government is wholly neglecting.", "Speaker, the Premier just doesn’t seem to get it. She doesn’t realize that kicking the can down the road on the increased costs of hydro is only going to burden further generations. A $28-billion debt is simply like refinancing your credit card or your mortgage, paying the minimum balance—and people know. People are savvy to this. They understand that this is simply a ploy for their re-election campaign.", "We’re 12 months, I believe, outside of the next election—around there. This is their last-ditch effort to make some move on the failures that we’ve seen over the last 16 years or so, and people aren’t buying it. Come down to Windsor and Essex county and present your plan. Have a town hall. I will rent the hall. We’ll invite everybody. Present this plan.", "Speaker, I listened to our leader, Andrea Horwath, this morning on AM800 with Lynn Martin, and Andrea fully dissected this government plan for what it was: a cynical ploy to buy votes with the public’s own money. But what was more telling was not only the easy dissection of this, but when people called in afterwards to reflect and to relate their stories—they’re not buying this. It’s clear that the Premier has lost the confidence of the majority of the electorate in this province.", "So for them to make this drastic move, knowing that they don’t have the support of this province, burdening future generations with a massive debt load and not even coming close to attacking the root issues of the problem with hydro in this province—the expansion of privatization, the oversupply problems that we have, and the distribution problems to rural and northern Ontario. None of this bill addresses any of those problems—nothing.", "What it simply does is refinance a debt over a longer period of time, which will ultimately result in us paying more. You’re going to get four years of minimal relief out of this bill, enough time for them to rearrange the deck chairs. Possibly there will be a leadership contest, but they’re trying to buy four years of relief, of electoral acceptance, with this bill. I can tell you, Speaker, that people are not buying it. They don’t want it. They see through the cynicism of this. They see it as cynical, and they want a real plan. They want to know that the asset that we’ve paid for, invested in—I hear the Minister of Energy stand up and talk about the investments that have been made into the system, over $50 billion of investments, of public dollars, taxpayer dollars that have been invested in the system. Yet, you’re selling 60% of it for $9 billion, so where’s the other $41 billion worth of value? Where’s the other $41 billion that we’ve put into the system?", "Your valuation of that 60% of the asset is so low, it discounts that generation of investment that people have put in. We own that system. We’ve invested in it. It is ours, and you’re selling it off and have sold it off at a fire sale to cover your own hides and to play a little bit of a shell game with the people of this province. They justify it by saying that they need that money and are going to use that money for investments in infrastructure around the province. Never has a government ever needed to sell off an asset as important as Hydro One to finance infrastructure. We’ve always been able to do it under traditional models, and we’ve done it well. This is a government that has found no other way—cannot find another way—to support our infrastructure needs for our communities.", "Speaker, I’ve got a road in my area, Highway 3, that has been on the books for over 20 years in terms of its need to be completed. If they couldn’t do it back then, how do we expect them to indeed finish the job that they started?", "This bill is so transparent and obviously a ploy by this government to try to pull the wool over the eyes of the people in our ridings, to get them to turn away from the real issues, to temporarily forget about the damage that they’ve caused to this province and to our overall system, and to lend their support one last time. It is the Hail Mary of all Hail Marys. I have not seen, I don’t think, in this House or any other House this desperate of an attempt to retain power.", "It is apparent in their lack of confidence in themselves that they have time-allocated this motion. They want to ram this thing through as quickly as possible.", "They were quick out of the gate with advertisements. We saw the ads for this bill well, well before we even saw the bill. We saw the ads all over the place for it: the Fair Hydro Act. Well, what is the Fair Hydro Act? “Well, you’ll see it soon. We’re going to present it soon.”", "Now, with eight days left in the Legislature, we get it on the table—a truncated debate. They’re going to jam this thing through and go hop-skipping through the next dog days of summer, touting this terrible plan.", "But we’re not going to stand for it. We’re proudly going to vote against it. As New Democrats have and always will, we have presented a comprehensive plan that people understand, that is true to the needs of the people, that is honest with them about the challenges ahead and that doesn’t blanket over what needs to happen." ],

Again, this government—they don’t even want to debate. They did the same thing this morning, where the mover said, “The parliamentary assistant and the minister are going to speak later.” Do you know what?

Basically, we’re dealing with Bill 87, which is a bill from the Minister of Health. Get this, Speaker: This notice of motion 29 under standing order 47 has the Legislative Assembly committee sit tomorrow. This committee normally meets on Wednesdays from 1 to 3 p.m. This motion programs that committee to meet from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m., not to hear public hearings, not to gauge comments from members of the Legislative Assembly, not to have a discussion in committee about the merits of Bill 87 or what they’ve heard from stakeholders or to have a deliberation about what should be added or not; they’re going to deal with clause-by-clause amendments for the bill that have been filed with the Clerk by 12:45 p.m. on Wednesday, May 17.

I go back to the throne speech, when we all got brought in here in July 2014, when the government talked about being open and transparent. They talked about transparency and accountability. In fact, I can remember one of the lines that was in the speech. It talked about putting partnership over partisanship. Isn’t that a laughable statement coming out of this government, now that we’ve seen how they want to govern by time allocation motion? It doesn’t matter whether it was the time allocation motion we just finished dealing with on Bill 132—their hydro plan, the one that they’ve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe millions of dollars, advertising before they even placed the bill in the order paper.", "So now they’ve got another bill that’s before a committee that normally meets every Wednesday.

They always talk about good words and listening to people and consulting people, and yet, when the rubber hits the road, third reading debate is half an hour.

But it got the conversation going, and I think that’s what Arnold has always tried to do.", "Some of you have emailed me, or called me or spoken to me in the hallway, and were really concerned about Arnold and some of the emails that he sent. I remember getting a call, when André Marin was the Ombudsman, from one of his staff asking me if I talk regularly to Arnold because, as he said to me one day in my office—as someone who has kids, I can’t imagine what he has gone through over those many, many years of information not being provided about justice not being served from our system.", "You know what? If this bill solved those problems, I’d be the first one to say, “Let’s get it through the House. Let’s get it through as fast as possible.” But that’s not what this bill does. I just have a real problem with us spending our whole legislative day today—really, that’s all we’ve done, right? All morning we dealt with the time allocation motion on Bill 132. It ran into the afternoon, and we’re now dealing with this second motion from this government, so we’ve taken the entire legislative day to just talk about this government’s desire to get their bills passed and get out of here for the couple of months we have as a break. I just think that’s not the speech that I heard from the throne when we were elected.", "The other thing that they said at the time was that they were going to put evidence in front of ideology. Just like I haven’t seen them put partnership over partisanship—in fact, with the government House leader’s office, I see the opposite; it’s partisanship first and partnership last. We’ve had a situation in this House, a past practice over the last little while, that we’ve been able to, in the last couple of weeks of the session, actually pass some meaningful bills and have three parties that could co-operate on some things. So I’m very, very disappointed.", "The final thing that I want to talk about today is a quote that I didn’t read this morning. I referenced it, but I want to read it now. It’s a quote from the member for St. Catharines, Jim Bradley, the dean of the Legislature, who will be celebrating on, I believe, May 30, his 40 years in office. It’s a quote that I want to read from the member for St. Catharines from May 30, 2001:", "“I regret that we are dealing once again with yet another time allocation motion, which is a motion that chokes off debate in the Legislative Assembly. It is my observation after a number of years, and I think talking to people who have observed this Parliament for a number of years, that it has been diminished so remarkably by this government that it has become almost irrelevant. That is most unfortunate, not simply for those of us who sit in the opposition or for the combatants who are of a partisan nature in this House, but for the democratic institution that indeed it has been in the past.”", "Speaker, that’s very telling given what this government is doing in this last session." ],

I remember, as a person before I was elected, coming and sitting in the public galleries. Those were the days where you didn’t have somebody blocking you at the door and making you get passes and so on. You simply had to sit in the public gallery and watch the debates that took place. And we did sit in those days; the House did sit both in the daytime and sometimes in the evening, particularly on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.", "“If you listened to the debate in those days—I’ll say, admittedly, that there are always those who view the past as perhaps being better than the present, but I had a number of students who have gone through the Hansards and read some of the speeches and noted that indeed they were very good speeches in the House in those days. They were more lengthy than they are now, in many cases, so that ideas were able to be elaborated upon. There was a greater detailed analysis of legislation that took place, not only in the House in Committee of the Whole, because often we went to committee of the whole to deal with clause-by-clause, but also in committees of the Legislature.", "“I think it was more ecumenical than it is today.”", "I remember one of the bills that the government had laid out. I actually asked for unanimous consent to go into Committee of the Whole so that we could deal with our amendments that had been turned down. But also, if the government wanted to deal with their amendments that they tried to get by UC, we could debate them in the Committee of the Whole House. I note that the member for St. Catharines talked about that in 2001, that that was something that was done on a regular basis, especially when you had a more substantive committee system, where the government actually wanted to hear from Ontarians, where the government actually wanted to go out and tour Ontario to hear those voices.", "The final quote from the member for St. Catharines goes on: “Today the strongest person is the party whip. The party whip simply tells the members of the committee what shall happen, and it happens. That’s unfortunate, because on all sides I think members have something to contribute: the opposition to concede when the government has made moves that are acceptable and good, and the government members to find problems that might exist in government legislation. But that is virtually gone. It is virtually dictated now by the Premier’s office. The speeches we hear in the House tend to be speeches which seem to originate from the government caucus service bureau, and I understand the need for some research for speeches, but they are virtually meaningless, because they can’t influence the government or the procedures that take place. That’s most unfortunate.”", "I think the member for St. Catharines was right. It’s ironic that he’s now the government whip, the person he talked about in 2001 who had all the power. But I do think that this government has taken cutting off debate, choking debate, to a new low. I just can’t believe it, given the fact that this Bill 87 affects the Animals for Research Act, the Elderly Persons Centres Act, the Health Insurance Act, the Immunization of School Pupils Act, the Laboratory and Specimen Collection Centre Licensing Act, the Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, the Ontario Drug Benefit Act, the Pay Equity Act, the Public Hospitals Act and the Regulated Health Professions Act. It deals with so many acts; why would the government, in this case, want debate choked off?", "I can’t understand why this government can’t accept voices from Ontarians or from the opposition that have a differing view. This was a government, remember, that in that famous throne speech talked about partnership over partisanship. It’s a bunch of malarkey." ],

We allocated four half days for deputations. We all agreed together that we would start the deputations as early as we could and we extended the time for deputations on those four Wednesday afternoons when the committee regularly sits so that we could hear from more people because the demand to speak to this bill was really huge.", "We agreed on a system that every week at 9 o’clock on Monday we would get the list of everybody who had asked to present and who had not been scheduled to present; each party would prioritize who they wanted to hear from. This repeated itself four times to give as many people as possible a chance to be heard. I must say, Speaker, though, we still had dozens and dozens of people who wanted to be heard but never had a chance to do so. We did receive many written submissions, some of them from the people who had wanted to present to us but were not able to do so, but some we will never hear from.", "We also agreed as to how we would do clause-by-clause. Right off, when the bill was first printed, it didn’t take long to realize that there were some flaws and there were some what I would say were just mistakes in the bill that we all recognized needed to be corrected. Together, at the subcommittee, we decided that we would have two afternoons of clause-by-clause and that should allow us to get the job done.", "The subcommittee brought their report to the full committee. The full committee listened to it. The Liberals have a majority on committees, like they have in the House. They listened to that plan, they agreed to it and they voted in favour of it.", "This is what we had planned, this is what we had agreed to. This is how you put forward good legislation, when all sides of the House work together so that we can protect patients. Let’s face it, I don’t think there are any MPPs here who would say, “No, I don’t think patients should be protected; I think we should attack them.” No, this doesn’t happen. This is something that we could find common ground on and that we could agree to.", "And then, out of the blue, much to my surprise, this thing gets time-allocated. And now, rather than having two full afternoons to talk about clause-by-clause and to make amendments to this very important piece of legislation—and I’m about to go into some of the details of the bill and you will quickly understand how important this piece of legislation is. In order to make the amendments so that we get it right—because if we don’t get it right, the consequences could be dire, and I will dive into this in a few minutes.", "We had all agreed that’s the time needed to do the work. We had two afternoons, from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m., to get that job done. This has now been cut to two hours, and then the rest of the amendments will have been deemed to have been tabled, which is code—Speaker, I think you already know that—to mean that anything the opposition will put forward will be voted down and anything the Liberal government will put forward will be voted for, but without any debate.", "I have been in here for a few years—10 of them, actually—and I have been the health critic for all of those 10 years. Sometimes, as you read those bills, you make suggestions that will make the bill better, that will make sure that the bill goes in the direction and reaches the end goal that we all want, which is to protect patients. But no, none of that will take place. We will, like robots, read into the record what the amendment will be—no exchange of opinion or “Did you think of that? What do you think of that? Should we use this word rather than that word?” None of that will happen. No matter what the Liberals put forward, they will all pass. No matter what the opposition, whether it be the Progressive Conservatives or the New Democrats, put forward, it will be voted down.", "This is really disappointing. We had worked collaboratively, fairly well. If you look at the four weeks of deputations that we listened to, the debates around the table, I would call them constructive. You could tell by the questions that were asked to the deputants that we wanted to make that piece of legislation better. We had all identified areas where it was not quite up to snuff and would need to be changed a bit in order to achieve our end goal. All of a sudden, all of that goodwill, all of those good intentions, all of those hours of deputations go out the window. We will have two hours to talk to one another, and then, after this, we will become robots who read into the record pieces of legislation, often out of context—because to read section 4(2)(1)(a) doesn’t mean anything to anybody until you actually explain what this is all about. So we will read this into the record. It will be meaningless for 100% of the people who listen to us, when we already know that many people are interested in that bill.", "I can tell you that for the two hours of clause-by-clause, we will have to look through 36 Liberal amendments, 35 Progressive Conservative amendments and 43 NDP amendments. Trying to fit that many amendments into 120 minutes is impossible, unless all of us can talk way faster than we will ever be able to do. It’s just not feasible, which is too bad, because the bill comes in an order of things.", "The first part of the bill, the part that we will be dealing with first—I’m not saying that it’s not important—talks about the immunization of school pupils, so children’s vaccinations. The children’s vaccinations will change so that if people want to exempt their children from vaccination, they will now have to take an education session so that they fully understand the pros and cons of vaccinations and have a chance to have their questions answered. It will also change to make it that the care provider, whether a physician or nurse practitioner—or there could be other people allowed to give vaccinations in the near future. Whoever gives it to you, your care provider will be the one reporting to the health unit that such a vaccination has been given. So that’s the first part of the bill.", "Right off the bat, on the first part of the bill, we have a series of amendments. Why? Because public health units have come out, with all five sirens going, to tell us, “Hey, we haven’t got the resources to get all of that information in. We usually get a vaccination card that has three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 vaccinations, all at once, and we put it in.” None of the health units has the manpower to bring that in, and an electronic version of this does not exist in Ontario. The health unit uses this program called Panorama, but none of the primary care providers—and there are some primary care providers that are fully electronic in terms of records within their team, but they are not able to send this to the health unit electronically. You’re talking about a whole bunch of manual work that nobody has the resources to do. The health units have come to tell us, “Whoa, whoa, don’t implement this. We don’t have the resources to do this. The idea is good, but wait till we have an electronic way of doing that.”", "That will be the first part that we deal with, Speaker. Right off the bat, on the first part—schedule 1 of the bill—there will be some amendments, because you cannot put something in place that Ontario does not have the capability to do. We will be setting ourselves up to fail.", "What’s the point of asking physicians and nurse practitioners—who are the two who can give children immunizations right now—to feed all of that information to the health unit if the health unit is not able to put it into the database? We will be further off than we are now. Let me tell you, Speaker, that when there is an epidemic, it doesn’t matter what it is—the recent measles and mumps outbreak in Toronto can certainly demonstrate the value of the legislation, of obtaining updated immunizations and information, but the systems are not there.", "We know what we want to do. The end goal is clear, but the technology does not exist. Therefore, part of the bill has to be modified in order that we make sure that we don’t set them up to fail—not to mention that a lot of physicians say they don’t want this extra burden of work for something that will yield very little in return. Why is it that we don’t wait until the electronic health records that exist in primary care can communicate with Panorama—which is the electronic health record that the public health unit uses—so that every time you enter “immunization” into the health record of your primary care provider, it automatically “populates”—this is a fancy term that means “transfers it over to”—the health unit? Pretty reasonable. This will be the first part of the bill that we deal with.", "As I said, there is a very important piece of the bill, which is schedule 4, that we may never have time to deal with, never mind section 5. I always wondered why section 5 was in, but I’ll get to that quickly.", "We’re now talking about schedule 2. Schedule 2 of the bill had many deputants who came. All the way up to last Wednesday we had a number of people very knowledgeable about how our Laboratory and Specimen Collection Centre Licensing Act works in Ontario. They too have made very good suggestions.", "Let’s be clear, Speaker: Ontario is the only jurisdiction that has completely privatized community labs. None of the other provinces have ever done this. Why we have done this is a huge mistake. We have an opportunity to do something about that. Many people have come and said, “You are finally opening up the Laboratory and Specimen Collection Centre Licensing Act. Please take this opportunity to change things, because this act has not been open in decades.”", "Let me tell you that what a lab looked like in the 1990s and what a lab looks like in 2017 are two very different affairs.", "What we have right now is that hospitals do work for their in-patients and outpatients. If you need to go for surgery at the hospital or you’ve been going to the emerg or you’re admitted in one of their clinics for whatever ails you, the hospital will do their own testing. They will draw blood; they will do their own testing. They handle it in hospital, whether you’re an in-patient or an outpatient. But the minute you are at your physician’s, nurse practitioner’s, midwife’s or, I would say, naturopath’s and everybody else, then you go to a private lab.", "The way we have it set up for the private lab, they each have a share of the pie. Let’s say you look at the whole pie. We’ll say the whole pie would be, just for a laugh, $100 million. I’m not that far off. The whole pie would be $100 million. One lab has 40% of the pie; they get $40 million. The other lab has 60% of the pie; they get $60 million. And that’s it. The only regulation they have is that if they want to open up a new site, they have to let the ministry know. But if they want to close a collection site, they can do that any time they want.", "Guess what? I represent the rural riding of Nickel Belt. When I started as an MPP, we had a collection site in Hanmer, we had a collection site in Val Caron, we had a collection site in Chelmsford and we had a collection site in Onaping-Levack. We had many collection sites throughout. Now guess how many collection sites are left in Nickel Belt." ],

If you happen to live in an area of high-density population where the lab is able to make a lot of money on the volume of tests, you have very good access to private lab services. If you don’t live downtown in a big urban centre but you happen to live in rural Ontario or northern Ontario or anywhere that is not downtown, those private labs can shut down the collection centre whenever they want and there’s nothing the government can do. The only thing the government can do is to tell them if they can open up a new site or not.", "The opening was never an issue; it was the closing that was the issue. What a good opportunity: We have this Laboratory and Specimen Collection Centre Licensing Act open right here, right now. Why don’t we do those changes? But do you know what? I don’t think that by 3 o’clock tomorrow afternoon we will even be able to get into the second schedule of the bill, which means that none of those discussions will ever see the light of day—none of the good work that the committee has done together, I would say, so far in a non-partisan way. We were always able to find a middle ground to work together. All of this will be thrown out the window because the government decided to time-allocate.", "Why did they decide to time-allocate? I don’t know. The committee worked well. There is nothing to lead me to believe that anybody was going to hold this thing back. I thought we were working pretty hard to get it right. All of a sudden, “No, you will have two hours, and it doesn’t matter, all of the hard work and the goodwill that have been put into this. This goes out the window.” All of a sudden, you have a Liberal government that doesn’t want to play fairly anymore, that doesn’t want to collaborate, that doesn’t want to have the best result that comes when everybody listens to the other side and puts good ideas together to make a bill even better. I still don’t know why they’ve done that, but they have.", "There are other issues with specimen collection. One of the parts of the bill, as it exists right now, removes the existing exemption for physicians’ offices, nurse practitioners’ offices and midwives’ offices. Right now, if your physician or your nurse practitioner or your midwife so decides, they can draw blood or they can have somebody within their team do the blood test right there in their office. In northern Ontario, given that we have very few—remember? One lab on a large street in downtown Sudbury; that’s it, that’s all. Given that we have many, many physicians and nurse practitioner’s offices, community health centres, aboriginal health access centres, nurse practitioner-led clinics—they all have collection centres where they offer services so that people don’t have to drive that far. Now, with this bill, we are removing the existing exemption, which means that we don’t know, but maybe all of those collection centres that are in community health centres, physicians’ offices, nurse-practitioner-led clinics, aboriginal health access centres etc. will now have to go through the rigmarole of accreditation, equal to what you ask a lab to do.", "Everybody has come forward and said that this is a bad idea. Even all of the labs that have come and done deputations said that if they offer the services in a primary care team or a physician’s office, sure, the lab should have all of the accreditation, but if it is the physician’s office itself that provides the service—or the nurse practitioner, or the midwife etc. who provides the service—then they have the qualifications to do that safely. They have their own colleges that supervise that they do this within their scope of practice. The practice has been done in Ontario forever, amen. It is safe and it should continue.

I don’t know about you, Speaker, but when the Information and Privacy Commissioner reads through a bill and tells you that you should consider changing something, I feel like we should do those changes, because we appointed an Information and Privacy Commissioner for that specific reason.", "So here we go. He goes on to say, “There is no apparent justification for granting the ministry new authority to collect, use, or disclose personal health information; the ministry only needs to indirectly collect personal information. Therefore, amend this section as follows”—we’re in schedule 2, section 6, subsection 17.1(1), if anybody is following, but I doubt that. It goes: “The ministry may indirectly collect personal information and may use and disclose that information for the purpose of processing and issuing a licence under this act, subject to any requirements or conditions provided for in the regulations.”", "I would say that this is pretty reasonable. It still allows the ministry to do their work, and we will be basically following our own laws. I sure hope that we get to talk about this part of the bill, but frankly, I am not sure of that at all.", "But the part that really irks me in that bill—you will remember that right now the private labs dominate. That’s all we have in community labs, and the hospitals do their own work. For places like where I represent and many other places, it would make sense to ask a community hospital to do community lab work. Basically, in rural areas, they tend to be the only show in town, but in other areas, it would also make sense. I’m thinking of right here, across the road at Women’s Health in Women’s Hands. I’m thinking of Women’s College Hospital or other providers—sorry, not Women’s Health in Women’s Hands; I meant to say Women’s College Hospital. It would make sense for them to directly deal with some of their very vulnerable people that they deal with, or for many other hospitals who serve specific populations it would also make sense. But right now if a hospital decides to do this, they do not get compensated for doing that work. That work is assumed to have been done by the private sector and the private sector gets paid for that work, while the hospital does the work. It is quite reasonable that we would want to make sure that our hospitals are compensated for the community lab work that’s being done.", "The part that irks me no end is that it also opens the door for the private lab provider to start providing community lab services. Now you would have a for-profit lab company doing hospital work. We have seen this creeping in in some of our hospitals in Ontario. What this bill does is that it swings the door wide open for the privatization of our hospital lab services. Why on earth would we want to do that, Speaker?", "Our hospitals need to maintain lab services. Our hospitals will continue to be the ones that have emergency cases and they will continue to need the ability, as well as the equipment and the resources, to do that work. Now we will open that up to the private sector to come into our hospitals, take good hospital jobs that come with pension plans, benefits, good pay and half-decent hours, and give that to the private sector, which will only want the high-volume lab services that you make money on.", "I don’t understand why you would have things like that in this bill. I can guarantee you that I will do my best so that those kinds of clauses are taken away. But chances are, I won’t have the opportunity to do that, because this government has decided to time-allocate the bill.", "There are a number of other amendments. As I said, we don’t open the lab and specimen collection act very often. It could be a good opportunity to remove barriers for other providers. We all know that there are barriers right now to point-of-care testing so that nurse practitioners can finally do point-of-care testing.", "I would ask that dietitians should also be allowed to do finger-prick tests. This is how you test for how much glucose is in the blood, how much sugar is in the blood, for people with diabetes. For a lot of dietitians, a big part of their caseload is dealing with people who have diabetes, but they’re not allowed to do finger-prick tests so that they can see the amount of sugar in a patient’s blood. We have the opportunity to do changes. I think that when the Dietitians of Canada came and talked to us about this, there seemed to be a good reception from all sides of the House. I sure hope that we will see that.", "Another thing that we see opening the door is—remember I told you how Ontario is the only province that has privatized all of their community lab work and has basically taken the pie and given everybody a percentage of the pie? No matter how many collection centres they have, no matter how much work they have, they get a piece of the pie. Now we’re expecting them to bring managed competitions forward.", "We have seen this in home care, and right now our home care system is broken. One of the major reasons our home care system is broken is that the different home care companies fight against one another for contracts and hold back on best practices as a competitive advantage. That’s not how health care works. In health care, if you find something good, if you develop a best practice, you share it with everybody and their brother so that everybody learns and our health care system becomes better throughout. But not in home care. In home care, they will keep their best practices as a competitive advantage so that they can get more contracts so that they can get more money.", "Now, through this bill, we are opening the door to the exact same thing with lab services.", "Coming from northern Ontario, representing 33 little rural communities, there’s nothing good in competition for us. Nobody is going to fight over Westree, Shining Tree, Gogama, Mattagami. Nobody’s going to—they’re beautiful communities, and I’d invite all of you to come to those communities, but are private labs interested in fighting over one another to get those contracts? No, absolutely not. Our health care system should not be sold to the lowest bidder, because we want equity of access, and we want people in rural and northern Ontario to have equitable access to lab services. So opening the door to that does not work.", "I see that the time is going by really quickly.", "The third section is the Ontario Drug Benefit Act. Finally, now that we have this act open, it would be a very good time to make sure that we get nurse practitioners included in all of the Ontario Drug Benefit Act so that we don’t have to keep coming back and coming back, so that they can prescribe the drugs that fall within their scope of practice. It could also be a good opportunity to make sure that nurse practitioners who are becoming more and more active in palliative care have access through the facilitated access mechanism under the Exceptional Access Program. What does that mean, Speaker? That means that in order to get some of the drugs that are used in palliative care that are not available to other people but only available to people in palliative care, you need to have this facilitated access and you need to be able to send requests to the Exceptional Access Program. Right now, only physicians—and only physicians who have taken facilitated access—are allowed to do that. While the act is open, why don’t we take this opportunity to fix that?", "I would also say that while the act is open, let’s add registered nurses to this. It’s becoming quite obvious that RN prescribing, if not here now, is right around the corner. Why not take advantage of this act being open to make sure that prescribing persons include more than just physicians, dentists, nurse practitioners and midwives? It could be a whole lot more.", "Then we have the reason for the bill. The reason for the bill is schedule 4. Schedule 4 was brought forward basically because of the Toronto Star. The Toronto Star did a number of exposés of horrifying stories of health care professionals, most of them being physicians, sexually abusing their patients. Then, they followed and saw how these cases were being handled, and all of us were disgusted by what we saw. We saw people’s lives being ruined because they had been abused by their physicians, and very little came of that in the view of punishment for the physicians who had abused their patients.", "The minister put forward a task force to look at this issue. Recommendations in a final report were sent to the minister and, finally, a year later, this bill was tabled. This bill does change a few things and basically will give the colleges—the colleges are the ones that give the physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, dentists—everybody. There are 27 regulated health professions in Ontario, regulated by 26 colleges, and all colleges look at the competency of their members and they are there to protect the public. If one of their members, whether it be a physio, a nurse or a physician, does wrong, they are the ones that are supposed to bring justice for the people who are being people abused. In the case of sexual abuse by mainly physicians, the punishment did not fit the crime, no matter how we looked at it.", "The panel made some serious recommendations. Some of them were adopted, but a lot of them were not. One of the recommendations that was adopted was that the college will be able to suspend a licence after they have received a complaint and done a first investigation. Of course, if the licence gets suspended, the person has a right to appeal that and has a right to be represented and to fight that. But at least you won’t have to wait. That was one of the horrifying factors, that a guilty physician would often drag on this process to the point where many other people became victims of the same physician because the process for discipline was so long before a licence could be suspended. So now the licence will be able to be suspended earlier into the process.", "We have to get this right, Speaker. Think about it: If you are a physician and you lose your licence, you lose your livelihood, you lose your reputation. You have a lot on the line. You have to make absolutely sure that the way we describe the physician or patient-provider relationship—when does the relationship start? When does it end? Who is allowed to do that and when? You have to make this extremely clear, otherwise the chances of making victims of innocent providers is there, it’s loud and clear, and it’s very worrisome to a lot of hard-working health care providers.", "Unfortunately, I don’t think we got it right. A lot of people came to tell us that they don’t think we got it right. Basically, we have defined in the bill a patient as somebody—you cease to be a patient a year after your last appointment. That works well for your typical family-physician/patient relationship. You’ve moved on; you’re not with this physician anymore. But that doesn’t work so well for a whole lot of providers. The example that we’re always given is a radiologist. You have an MRI or a scan or an X-ray done in Sudbury and a radiologist in Windsor reads your scan and sends the report back. This radiologist has no idea who you are and certainly has no idea that he’s had a patient-physician relationship with you. Yet the way we have defined this in the bill, they do. So within a year, if this physician happens to have a sexual relationship with somebody for whom he has read a scan, who he doesn’t even know he’s read a scan for, he could lose his licence, he could be named, and he could lose his livelihood.", "I don’t think we got that right. When something as important as your—you’ve worked really hard to become a nurse, a physio, an osteopath, a dentist, a physician, an occupational therapist or a speech—you’ve worked really hard to become a regulated health professional and, all of a sudden, because we don’t have the right definitions in the bill, you are at risk of losing your licence.", "The bill also gives a list of acts that are considered sexual abuse. I never like to work from a list. It seems like people who sexually abuse other people seem to be very creative in the ways they abuse other people.", "And now I see that the time is running out. There are many, many amendments that need to be done there.", "Section 5 of the bill—remember, I told you about section 5—is about seniors active living centres. Seniors active living centres have no patients whatsoever, but it is part of a bill that is called protecting patients. I don’t know exactly who we’re going to protect in section 5, but it has been shoved in there. I don’t know why. What it does is open up the door to private providers of elderly persons centres, now called seniors active living centres. I know a lot of retirement homes that would love to have seniors active living centres within their retirement homes because once grandma is used to coming here to play cards, once she needs care, she’s going to start paying the 5,000 bucks a month to that home.", "We did not need time allocation." ],

Do I not call her?” But you do and you find out she’s been waiting for that call. And then the relationship develops, as it naturally does, if it’s going to go in that direction. The next thing you figure out, “Oh, my God.” You talk about what you do, of course: “I’m a radiologist.” “Oh, that’s interesting. I had an X-ray about six months ago.” “Oh, my goodness, I read that X-ray. Oh, boy. Am I in trouble now.”", "Do you see how life can throw you a little bit of a curve sometimes?

I can tell you that a neighbour of ours, a year older than my youngest sister, actually was struck by a car blowing past a public school bus when she came home from school one day. We’ll never forget that. It was so frustrating that this young girl, coming home after a good day at school, was getting off the bus and was struck", "I don’t know why this government doesn’t walk its talk when they talk about wanting to make our roads safer for children. For Cathy, it was a close call. She did have head trauma and it affected her vision, but I’m so, so glad that she was able to come out of it. It’s a lesson for us all. We have to be so, so careful when, whether you’re in urban Ontario or rural Ontario, we’re approaching school zones and school buses. We must obey the law.", "For goodness’ sakes, the private member’s bill from the member from Chatham-Kent: It was good. There was no reason why it had to be voted down just a little bit ago in general government.", "Because this government voted down all 40 amendments brought forward by the member from Kitchener–Conestoga with regard to Bill 65, some would suggest that it was maybe just all partisan. Isn’t that unfortunate, Speaker? Even Hazel McCallion reinforces our leader’s position that there’s no monopoly on a good idea.", "Speaker, incorporating the PMB initiative introduced by the member from Chatham-Kent should not have been voted down. It should not have been hammered down by a partisan hammer. I’m so disappointed on that.", "I just want to talk a little bit more about why it’s important to keep our roads safe.", "There’s another initiative that was introduced a few years ago—I think it was in 2014—by our member from Parry Sound–Muskoka, and that was about paving the shoulders of our roads. I want to talk about that and focus on it a little bit.", "We had an incident a couple of years ago in the riding of Huron–Bruce, specifically in Huron county, where a teacher, a beloved teacher, was preparing and training for a triathlon. She was on her bike just near Carlow, and unfortunately, she got struck by a vehicle. She was tossed into the ditch and as a result she is now living life from a wheelchair. She had broken her back.", "But she has proven to be such an amazing inspiration. I am so pleased that she leads by example. In fact, I’ll say it this way: She’s actually picking up more speed. Nothing is stopping her since she has adjusted to life in a wheelchair. Julie Sawchuk is a person who needs to be admired, and the county of Huron is doing that.", "Just this past spring, the county of Huron passed an initiative whereby they are going to pave the shoulders of the road. I hope the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka is pleased that his initiative has been heard, specifically by the county of Huron. On the roads most travelled by bikes as well as regular cars and transport trucks and buses, they are going to pave the shoulders of the road to make life safer for all.", "Again, going back to Bill 65, we had a variety of amendments, aside from what I just touched on, to make our school zones safer, because there were some errors in the legislation that needed to be corrected—for example, the type of fines that would be experienced if someone was speeding in a community zone versus speeding in a school zone. So, even though they voted down our initiatives, I am glad that this government brought forward their own amendment to clean up their own mistakes.", "It has been a disturbing trend, Speaker. Going back for almost a year now, we have seen this government, bill in and bill out, use committee to fix their mistakes, and that is absolutely wrong." ],

The reason for that, Speaker, was that back on August 17, 2016, Minister Leal issued a directive to the Ontario Farm Products Marketing Commission. He indicated they were to develop a plan for engagement and consultation with interested parties and stakeholders and, “at a minimum, the plan shall include … a detailed economic analysis of industry competitiveness and opportunities for growth considered by the commission in support of any proposed amendments.” That was nine or 10 months ago.", "First of all, very clearly, where is this economic impact study? There has been considerable time now. Secondly, I asked when we will see the establishment of the industry advisory committee that has been talked about for the last 10 or 11 months or a year. I also asked when we will see the election of directors and the appointment of staff to make the required decisions during harvest. Planting, irrigating and harvesting are looming, and there is the need for oversight with respect to grading, adjusting contracts, filling contracts, given changes—who knows what the weather will be like then, and so many other factors that can have a dramatic influence on the production of a crop.", "Last summer, we circulated a petition. I attended so many meetings, primarily of cucumber growers and tomato growers. I will just read in part; it concluded by saying,", "“Therefore we, the undersigned, petition the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as follows:", "“That the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and the government of Ontario support the Ontario Processing Vegetable Growers’ right to negotiate price terms and conditions of contracts for processing vegetables in Ontario….”", "There was an article recently—it would be this month—in the Farmers Forum, and it brings us up to date a bit. It indicates that the processing vegetable growers are looking to overturn what they say is a dangerous precedent set by the province after the growers’ organization board of directors was fired by the province and replaced by an appointed trustee to act as a negotiator.", "The growers believe the province sided with the processors to reach a contract price point. The growers have said that the impasse in negotiations could and should have been resolved by binding arbitration. Obviously, when there is an impasse—it was resolved; it’s over with. Why do we have this continued situation of an appointed trustee?", "Myself and the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex have been working on this for so many months now. We feel there’s inadequate representation with respect to the negotiation process. We’ve received so many emails. Here’s one, for example: “The wish of the growers to move on into more successful seasons of negotiations and harvests has been hampered by the lack of elected representatives with the appropriate supports and respect to be equal negotiating partners to members of the processing industry. The refusal of the government of Ontario to replace the trustee—who fully admitted his lack of knowledge and experience with the processing vegetable industry—with elected grower representatives is taking the power to negotiate with processors out of the hands of the growers. Inadequate representation reduces the faith of the grower in the long-term sustainability of the industry, and can greatly impact their financial decisions and choice to remain a member of the growing community.”", "Speaker, something like this happened down in Australia a number of years ago. It did not end well for the growers, for the processers and for the industry overall, and our concern remains." ],

In a London Free Press story, the member from Haldimand–Norfolk praised the minister’s action, stating, “This is the way democracy is supposed to work. This is quite heartening.”", "Ontario’s agri-food sector is an economic powerhouse contributing to growth in our province, creating more than $36 billion in GDP and supporting 800,000 jobs. As this House knows, we are working with the agri-food sector to create 120,000 jobs and to double our growth as part of the agri-food growth challenge. We’re well on our way to meeting that challenge, with 42,000 jobs already created since we launched the challenge in 2013.", "In contrast, there have been both actions and inactions made by the opposition, which leaves their commitment to the province’s agri-food sector unclear.", "Mr. Speaker, in the coming weeks, Minister Leal is embarking on a trade mission to key Great Lakes states to meet with government and business leaders, to emphasize the importance of two-way trade between the US and Ontario.", "During this engagement mission, the minister will no doubt highlight our government’s clear support for the supply management system, which has a proven track record of protecting Ontario producers, processors and consumers from extreme market fluctuations.", "Where do the member opposite, his leader and his party stand on this issue? They haven’t even responded to the comments made by the administration down south about our dairy sector. Why haven’t they?", "Mr. Speaker, I was disappointed to hear that both the opposition and the third party will be voting against our government’s fair hydro plan.", "It’s rich for the member to say that he and his party are on the side of farmers when, time and time again, the opposition have voted against measures introduced by our government to support our farmers. They voted against our Risk Management Program that has consistently helped farmers since it was launched in 2011; they voted against our $30-million investment in the Local Food Fund in 2013, which was so successful in helping farmers innovate and deliver more local food in Ontario to consumers; and now they will be voting against giving farmers a 25% break on their electricity bills, beginning this summer. That is just shameful.", "Mr. Speaker, we’re taking steps to grow Ontario’s farming sector, support rural Ontario and help Ontarians in their everyday lives. I’m proud of all the initiatives we’ve worked on in helping our farmers meet their goal of supplying food to this great province of Ontario. Good things do grow in Ontario." ],

  "text" : [ "As I noted in my question this morning, it has been over five years and four Ministers of Natural Resources and Forestry since I first started asking about the future of Rondeau cottages. The reason I asked the question is that there’s less than a week to go before the Rondeau cottagers return to see what repairs may be needed after this past winter. Their leases are set to expire in less than eight months, and with that, the current agreement states that the Rondeau cottagers will have to tear down their cottages at their own expense.", "To explain why I was dissatisfied with the minister’s response this morning, I will simply quote from the various ministers who previously responded to my questions on this matter in years past. On June 20, 2012, former MNR Minister Gravelle stated, “We have initiated environmental and economic studies to help inform our decisions for Rondeau in the future.” Then on April 3, 2014, then-Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry David Orazietti said, “As the member also knows, there were environmental and economic studies that were supposed to be done. They are nearing completion. We should be able to release those in the next several weeks....”", "Then we fast-forward to July of the same year, 2014. Now it’s Minister Mauro’s turn. He stated, “It’s my understanding that a third-party review is being undertaken on both of the studies—both the environmental study and the economic activity study—so that we can very reliably count on the data that is yielded from both of those studies, and that will infuse our policy- and decision-making process on a go-forward basis.", "“Once we’ve had an opportunity to review the details from those studies,” he went on to say, “we’ll be in a better position to advise the member of a decision, going forward.”", "Well, let’s go forward now to October 23, 2014. I again asked if the government was ready to make a decision. Minister Mauro refused to put a timeline on the decision and shared this detailed breakdown of the ministry’s process. The minister stated, “There were at least two studies that were conducted related to Rondeau, both economic and environmental. Those studies were brought in-house. They were reviewed. The issues related to Rondeau are considered so important to the government that they not only took in those studies, but then they also asked for a peer review of those studies. We’re still analyzing that data.” That’s what Minister Mauro said.", "Now, here we are. Two and a half years ago, the environmental and economic studies were completed and a peer review of these studies had already been asked for. Flash forward to this morning, 936 days later, when the new minister stated that the environmental study was not even complete: “That’s where it rests right now: with the Ministry of the Environment, which is doing an environmental assessment.” It feels likes Groundhog Day here, Speaker.", "Economic and environmental studies were initiated no later than when I asked a question back in 2012. In early 2014, the minister of the day stated that the government would be releasing those finished studies in a few weeks. Months later, the same former minister stated that they were going to be doing a peer review of those studies. Now years later, the newest minister stood up in the House and told me that they are now only starting the environmental study.", "Given that the government has not been able to keep its own story straight, it’s hard to trust any updates that they’re providing regarding the future of cottages at Rondeau park.", "Over the last several months, I have spoken with Minister McGarry several times about the Rondeau issue, and she always mentioned that I will be happy with what the government is going to do. I would ask, “What is that?”, and the answer was, “You’ll be happy with what the government is going to do.”", "Time is ticking. Next week, these cottagers are going to be going back to Rondeau park to see what repairs need to be done from this past winter, yet their leases are now set to expire this year. These cottagers are great stewards of the land who have cared for their lots and the ecosystem going back generations.", "So, Speaker, to the minister I simply say that it’s time to stop cutting bait and start fishing. Either stop stringing Rondeau cottagers along and let them know you’re kicking them out, or let them know that their leases will be extended, so they can do the necessary repairs on their cottages, which will also boost the economy, as well. Either allow them to buy the lots their modest cottages are on or extend their cottage leases." ],

I know that we can both admit that this is a very complex situation and one with a long history, and there are many interested stakeholders both in support of and not supportive of the cottage leases.

In fact, I know that my ministry office staff has met with him before, professionally and sincerely, to discuss his concerns and provide him with updated information.", "My office has also been in frequent contact with the Rondeau Cottagers Association. In fact, they were in contact with the cottagers’ association as recently as yesterday. If the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex ever wants to join those conversations, I would encourage him to reach out to my staff to accommodate that.", "I know that December 31, 2017, is the date that the current leases expire for the cottages in Rondeau. I am pleased to say that our ministry is actively taking the steps that may lead to allowing existing private cottage lots in Rondeau Provincial Park to continue for the next 20 years, until December 31, 2038, something I know the member opposite is also well aware of.", "But I do want to emphasize that there are members of the public who are strongly opposed to having the cottage-lot leases in the park extended. So I will further remind the member that a final decision will be informed by consultation, environmental and economic studies and an environmental assessment, which is ongoing, as he has pointed out in his remarks. This approach is intended to balance the interests of the public and the cottagers, and also to demonstrate fiscal responsibility while protecting the environment in Rondeau Provincial Park.", "This is an important point to make: In any decision on this file, we have to ensure that we as a government are doing the best thing for the people of Ontario, whether that’s ensuring that a sensitive environmental area is protected, or ensuring that the taxpayer is not footing the bill for a select few individuals to continue to enjoy cottage properties.", "This is something that is important to me, and I’d like to reiterate my concern. We need to make sure that the Rondeau cottagers pay their fair share to the people of Ontario. Being someone who has advocated for fiscal prudence, I would hope that the member opposite agrees with me on this matter.", "Speaker, there is something I know that the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex and I can both agree on, and that’s our appreciation for the strong community that the leaseholders in Rondeau have created. I know he has spoken about it before, and I would agree with him. But that’s why it’s important that we get it right. Rondeau is different from the situation in Algonquin Provincial Park, the other provincial park that has cottage-lot leases within its boundaries. Rondeau is a much smaller area, with much larger properties. In fact, some of these cottages are two-storey houses with two-car garages. That means that the concentrated impact of the cottages on the surrounding environment is much more significant. It’s imperative that we make sure that the impact does not have significant ecological impacts, especially for our nearby species at risk. That’s part of the reason why it has taken our Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change a while to sort this out.", "As I said, the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change plays a very key role and is ultimately responsible for the final decision on the environmental assessment process. We have been continuing to work closely with that office on this process. They have not got it back to us, but I do know that I have faith that the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change will act appropriately in the final decision. We continue to work very closely with them.", "It’s in the interest of the leaseholders—also the park—especially given the complexity of this issue. It’s important to make sure that we have a balance of all interested parties and of all of the facts and opinions on the matter, and to make sure that, going forward, we make the right decision, not only for the environmental issues but also for the cottagers and the general public." ],

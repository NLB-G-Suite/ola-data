En fait, la Loi sur le renforcement et l’amélioration de la gestion publique met à jour 15 lois différentes. Par l’intermédiaire de ce projet de loi, nous envisageons d’apporter des réformes à de nombreux aspects du gouvernement; des reformes qui, dans bon nombre de cas, moderniseront nos programmes et processus, et faciliteront l’accès au systèmes.", "I look forward to hearing from the members on this bill as we begin a discussion.", "In one way or another, the proposed amendments will affect nearly every resident and business in this province. These changes will ultimately support our government’s efforts to keep our economy moving and build Ontario up. Some of the amendments will solidify rights and freedoms of Ontarians and non-residents. Some will provide better support for families. For example, changes to the Courts of Justice Act would reflect the new non-resident divorce permitted under the federal Civil Marriage Act. This legislation applies to same-sex couples and others who were married in Ontario but whose own jurisdiction does not legally recognize their union, making divorce impossible where they now live. We want to make it clear that everyone is treated equally.", "Un autre changement proposé devrait rendre la vie des familles avec enfants plus facile. Après la rupture d’un mariage, la question de la garde des enfants et des pensions alimentaires surgit souvent. Nous voulons nous assurer que les enfants dont les parents ne vivent plus ensemble sont entre de bonnes mains et qu’ils reçoivent tout le soutien dont ils ont besoin pour grandir heureux et en bonne santé. C’est pourquoi mon ministère travaille sur un plan qui permettra facilement aux parents de mettre en place et de changer en ligne des paiements de pensions alimentaires.", "Proposed amendments to the Family Law Act will clarify that parents who use the online child support service, once it becomes operational, would have the same ongoing financial disclosure obligations as parents who are paying a child support order from a family court.", "Receiving updated financial disclosure helps a parent who receives child support decide whether they should apply to update their child support amount based on the other parent’s income. This disclosure is integral to the child support payment process.", "We are also looking out for those who watched over us when we were younger. As our parents age, we know how important it is to have trusted people surrounding them and quality services to care for them. Si vous avez un père ou une mère malade qui vit à domicile ou dans un établissement de soins de longue durée, vous savez à quel point le transport est problématique, surtout si votre père ou votre mère doit être transporté sur une civière.", "Pour bon nombre d’entre nous, cela signifie utiliser un service de transport spécial avec civière et confier notre être cher à un fournisseur de services privé. Nous voulons nous assurer que les membres de notre famille sont en sécurité et bien soignés, et nous voulons avoir entièrement confiance dans les fournisseurs de services. C’est pourquoi nous proposons des modifications au Code de la route qui imposeraient des règlements rigoureux aux véhicules de transport avec civière et à leurs conducteurs. C’est une industrie qui n’a jamais été réglementée. Si les fournisseurs de services ne remplissent pas nos normes, ils risquent de perdre leur entreprise. C’est très simple.", "We are also trying to make it easier to move people on a larger scale. Making investments in infrastructure not only grows the economy, but it puts in place services that people and communities rely on. The proposed amendment to the City of Toronto Act would adjust provisions regarding Toronto Transit Commission operation in nearby municipalities. The TTC and the regional municipality of York have reached an agreement in this regard, and these changes will help make it easier to operate the Toronto-York Spadina subway extension.", "Looking even further down the road, this will allow for more collaboration when it comes to delivering regional transit across the greater Toronto and Hamilton area. It will give the TTC flexibility to enter into similar agreements with other neighbouring municipalities for future projects. The Toronto-York Spadina subway extension would help both transit commuters and those in their cars. It’s expected to add 36 million transit trips and eliminate 30 million car trips each year. It will help get the GTHA moving.

Thank you all for your help in putting together such a comprehensive bill. Without you, this wouldn’t have been possible. It’s a real demonstration of how every part of this government is working together to respond to the ever-evolving needs of families, businesses and entire communities.", "Taken together, this discrete set of significant amendments to 15 Ontario laws will contribute to the government’s plan to build Ontario up. With every step we take to modernize the processes and improve the efficiency of government, we are strengthening the foundation of this province.", "As I noted a moment ago, the Strengthening and Improving Government Act includes amendments to 15 existing pieces of legislation. They are: the City of Toronto Act, the Highway Traffic Act, the Courts of Justice Act, the Family Law Act, the Occupational Health and Safety Act, the Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, the Employment Standards Act, the Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act, the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act, and several others as well.", "While some of these changes are as small as refreshing the wording of an existing statute, others have the potential to significantly impact the lives of Ontarians.", "Earlier, the Attorney General spoke of our proposal to regulate non-emergency transportation services. We entrust the transportation of our loved ones to these unregulated companies and to these drivers. That’s why it’s so important that we take steps to make sure our family members are treated professionally and are kept safe.", "But this is not the only thing we’re looking to improve in the Highway Traffic Act. Other proposed changes aim to make paperwork easier for drivers. This would give the transportation ministry options when serving a notice of intention to cancel a vehicle permit or driver’s licence. In addition to traditional letter mail, for example, such notices could be delivered at a ServiceOntario counter. This could help ensure that drivers receive their notice before any licence cancellation takes place. They will also be given the opportunity and the appropriate amount of time to respond to any requirements, if need be.", "Proposed changes to the Highway Traffic Act will also allow for electronic correspondence relating to commercial vehicle operators’ registration. This includes accepting applications, renewals and client updates. It allows the Ministry of Transportation to issue notices, commercial vehicle operator certificates and account updates electronically.", "It is all part of how we are planning to modernize government processes. Doing so allows us to evolve and look to the future, all while helping residents by making services more convenient.", "You can also see modernization through our amendment to the Provincial Offences Act that allows for certain records to be created and transferred electronically. This change would create a legal authority for provincial offences courts to maintain an end-to-end electronic court record, from the filing of a charge to the disposition of a case.", "This would also put in place a framework that would allow municipalities that are equipped to implement new technologies to do so. In municipalities where these new electronic records are adopted, court users would have the opportunity to choose a format to receive documents that is easier for them, such as email. It could also lead to reduced postage costs for the local courthouse.", "We have also committed to propose several changes set out in the 2012 Physician Services Agreement with the OMA as part of our promise to provide better health care for all Ontarians—and hopefully prevent sneezing from happening during my debate.", "If this bill is passed, the Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act will provide immunity for OMA directors and staff but not the association itself. The point of this proposed provision is to limit legal action against representatives for acts done in good faith during negotiations with the government related to physician agreements and payments, for example, agreements that contain fee changes for certain physician groups.", "We need to make these updates surrounding agreements made with those who provide health care for all Ontarians. It speaks to our values that health and safety are of paramount importance for everyone in this province.", "This is why we must ensure that the safety of people in the workforce continues to evolve and is made stronger. The amendments to the Occupational Health and Safety Act would incorporate new standards that could improve worker health and safety, as employers and workers will have access to a wider range of information about hazardous workplace chemicals. These changes are part of a broader national initiative to adopt international standards for classifying hazardous workplace chemicals and providing information on labels and safety data sheets. To adopt the new standards requires changes to federal and provincial or territorial regulations.", "Amendments to federal hazardous products legislation and regulations came into force this past February. All provincial and territorial governments are in the process of amending their occupational health and safety legislation and regulations to reflect the federal changes. Now it’s our turn. The information will be presented in a standardized format which will be easier to understand than the labels and safety data sheets currently in place. We’re looking at all aspects of Ontarians’ lives, Mr. Speaker, as you can see from the examples I’ve set out for you and the members so far. Many changes will be coming.", "Consider the amendments to the Vital Statistics Act. They would allow the stock that is used for certificates and certified copies of registrations, which have the signature of the Registrar General and/or the Deputy Registrar General reproduced, to continue to be used when those individuals leave office. This would be the case for documents such as long form birth certificates. Currently, certificates have the signatures of both the Registrar General and Deputy Registrar General, and certified copies of registrations have the signature of the Deputy Registrar General. When these individuals no longer hold office, certificate stock and stock for certified copies of registrations that have reproductions of their signatures can no longer be used. Because of this, the Vital Statistics Act amendment would reduce waste and save costs. This amendment would also align Ontario’s practices with those of most jurisdictions in Canada.", "I realize this is a lengthy list of amendments; there are even more listed in this bill, beyond those discussed by myself and the Attorney General this morning. We want to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of government for the people of Ontario. They are, and always will be, top of mind, which is why I encourage members to support this bill.

We’re not here just to clap for each other, although some days it certainly feels that way. I think we’re here to have the best interests of the public in mind. If we want to safeguard health care and our medicare system, as the member was just saying; if we want to have a top education system in the world; if we want to take care of our seniors; if we want to take care of people with Alzheimer’s and dementia—who were visiting us yesterday—and provide support for their caregivers, who are often family members who quit jobs to take care of residents—all these types of things that we’re trying to help. I believe that all of us here have the same caring personalities. That’s why we’re here, and we want to serve the public.", "But we also have to understand that we have to watch the revenue coming in and the expenditures going out. Without adequate resources, we cannot hold on to medicare, we cannot help our seniors and we cannot have a top-rated education system in the world.", "I’m just hopeful that we can stop the wasteful spending and start streamlining and using the computer systems that so many other governments are using to streamline agencies and to better serve the public, using less of the valuable resources, so that those resources can go where they’re meant to go, to serve the very people who voted us into office." ],

But if all we are doing is changing a few things, so that the ambulances themselves are safer, and putting a little bit of responsibility on the drivers, I would say that I didn’t wait for eight years to only get that. I’m not going to stand for this, Speaker.", "Are those good steps? Yes, absolutely. Those ambulances—I think the Ombudsman said it best: They look and smell like an ambulance, but they may lose a wheel on their way to the call. It is not what we want in Ontario. Am I happy that we’re going to be regulating the actual vehicles? Yes. I don’t want the wheels falling off, and I don’t want the patients falling out the back door, either.", "But this is not enough. To have a vehicle that is safe and worthy to be on the road is one step. To make sure that the people in the back of the ambulance know how to look after your grandfather and grandmother and everybody else that the minister said rides in the back of that ambulance—this has not been addressed.", "Sure, the wheels won’t fall off of those pretend ambulances anymore; that’s good.

Somewhere north of 50,000 students a day travel to that campus. By having that subway up and running and by making sure, through Bill 85 and through a number of the other leadership decisions that have been made by the government on this side of the House, the Liberal government, with respect to making sure that we invest in this kind of crucial transit infrastructure—it will significantly help those students, tens of thousands of them, to arrive at that campus.

Probably the minister’s statement was as long as the leadoff. Anyhow, we’re looking forward to it. We’re looking forward to seeing some of these things taking place and some of these corrections being made by this legislation.", "As the critic for education and training, colleges and universities, I wanted to speak a little bit about one section: schedule 6, the Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act. It gives the college registrar the authority to appoint an investigator to investigate the conduct of a member and provides that for the purpose of such an investigation, the investigator has all the powers of a commission under part II of the Public Inquiries Act. This latter act was repealed and replaced by the Public Inquiries Act, 2009. The proposed amendment would replace the reference to the Public Inquiries Act with a reference to the Public Inquiries Act, 2009. The amendment is required to ensure that the statutory cross-references of the act are accurate.", "In June 2006, an amendment to the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act provided that each college, rather than its board of governors, was a corporation without share capital. The amendment would provide certainty with respect to the continuity of the ownership of college assets and obligations acquired or incurred before and after June 2006.", "The act would be amended to provide certainty with respect to the ownership of assets and obligations, allowing colleges to respond easily to questions about the continuity of ownership, given prior changes in legislation relating to college boards. The second part of that is fairly clear, and I agree with it.", "I want to talk, Mr. Speaker, for a minute about the Ontario College of Trades. We fought hard against that. There were two or three ministers, during that period, who we dealt with. Although we’re trying to make amendments to this investigator and add this investigator’s title to the job, I’m still concerned that this is becoming a bureaucracy that is really not needed in the province of Ontario. I think they have six floors in a building downtown on Bay Street.", "We brought the legislation in on the Ontario College of Trades act, and what I would suggest to you is that there was very, very little consultation done with the people who hold a certificate of qualification in the trades in Ontario. Those trades basically apply to 22 compulsory trades—and other people have a certificate of qualification in trades that are non-compulsory but they’ve taken the full apprenticeship; for example, there are many people who work as carpenters but they don’t have the C of Q.", "The problem was that when we brought in the College of Trades act—there are actually 157 trades in Ontario—there was very little notification, even up to the point where people were getting their invoices in the mail. They didn’t realize what was actually happening at that particular ministry. So the people that had a certificate of qualification in these trades—the trade of electrician, for example—every three years would pay a total of $60 to the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities, and the cheque was sent to the Ministry of Finance. They would pay that $60 for a three-year certification. A sticker would come in the mail, they would put it on their certificate-of-qualification licence, and that would entitle them to practise in that trade for the next three years.", "What’s happened is, the fees went up substantially; they went up about 676%. They are now $130 a year plus the HST. That is per year. So it used to be $20 a year. It’s now $138.50, or something like that, the exact amount of money.", "On top of that, why I’m concerned is that, first of all, a lot of people didn’t even send their licences in; they didn’t send the cheque in—they didn’t get it in the mail or whatever. So there’s still a lot of turmoil right in that particular area. But on top of that, now they’ve got the bookkeeping to worry about every year. So for somebody who has been in the trades for the last 20 years and who has been used to doing it every three years, now what’s happening? They have to do it every year. Already, people have forgotten about having to make sure their licence is renewed. Once you lose it, we don’t know what the long-term impact will be in actually getting that licence back.", "The whole consultation that took place around the Ontario College of Trades, I thought, was not done in a very professional manner, and, as a result of that, tradespeople today in Ontario are quite bitter that they had to join this and they’ve paid these fees that are substantially higher.", "The government recognized that, and we certainly mentioned that leading up to the election last June, on June 12. During the election, Premier Wynne announced—they were up in Thunder Bay, and I remember her quote. She said that, based on the success of its first year—the College of Trades—we were going to have a review of it. If you were going to have a review of it, I don’t think it was very successful. That’s what we asked for. So Tony Dean is actually doing a review of the Ontario College of Trades right today.", "The problem is, again, we haven’t gone back to the tradespeople. The government has the database to send out the invoices for the renewal of their membership in the College of Trades each and every year. But what I suggest—and I’ve got it on the order paper as a question—is that a letter, a survey, should also be sent out to all the tradespeople in Ontario; that’s all of the people who have a C of Q. They should be able to have a survey on what their feelings were on the College of Trades. It shouldn’t be a former bureaucrat here at Queen’s Park saying, “This is what’s right and this is what’s wrong”; it should be the tradespeople themselves having a say in whether they believe the College of Trades should even be in existence, or where the College of Trades could be a benefit, or what are the negative things. They have not been informed on this at all. So that’s every tradesperson who walks to work with their tool box or their lunch box and they’re working on these job sites day in and day out; they have no say whatsoever in the review. I think that’s wrong.", "I know we’re making an amendment to the investigator and enforcement section, because the College of Trades has, I believe, 79 vehicles out there now, and they’ve got enforcement people running around making sure people have their licences and all that kind of thing. But when we’re doing a review of something so important, that impacts all the tradespeople in the province of Ontario, I think it’s a duty and a responsibility, as part of that review, that every tradesperson should be given a proper survey asking a series of questions, and one of the questions would be, “Should the College of Trades even exist?”", "I, for example, am a strong supporter of the community college system in Ontario. As the critic, I’ve been at, I believe, about 15 of them now. I’ve actually visited them, right from one end of the province to the other. I’ve still got to do the ones in northern Ontario and in the Sault Ste. Marie area and Timmins. But the reality is that these community colleges are doing a fantastic job.", "I think that the community college system could actually be responsible for all the trades in Ontario, and we wouldn’t need to have an Ontario College of Trades. We wouldn’t need to have this awkward apprenticeship system we’ve got today.

If you want to be a tradesperson, you go and you enrol in the community college that has the best program—say, for example, if it’s electricity and you want to go to Humber College, or if it’s welding and you want to go to Seneca, something like that. These community colleges have all of that information available. They have the framework and the infrastructure in place to actually enhance and improve the apprenticeship and training programs right here in Ontario.", "I want to just zero in on that for a second. The community college systems will be 50 years old in 2017, I believe it is. I hope a lot of them will be celebrating their phenomenal accomplishments. Every community college I go to has some kind of expertise in certain areas. It’s mind-boggling.

I believe the graduation rate at Georgian now—92% of the people will have job within six months of graduation. That’s pretty successful.", "When I say that the community college system should be responsible for the full apprenticeship program, I mean that sincerely. They should be the people who are taking the lead on what trades become compulsorily certified and what trades remain with the current C of Qs.", "Of course, the other thing that they can be zeroing in on is the number of students they allow into the system. We’re a supporter of the 1-to-1 ratio, in our caucus. The government and the College of Trades, of course, are not in favour of that. That’s a whole complex issue in itself, and I’m not going to zero in on all that today.", "The reality is that the community college system in Ontario is capable of doing much of the work, or most of the work, that the Ontario College of Trades is set up to do. It appears now to be no more than a duplication.", "Tradespeople with the College of Trades have kind of given up. They say, “Okay, we’ve just got to pay more. It’s another bunch of money.” They’re not really overly impressed with the enforcement division of it. For example, people can be tradespersons and they can be running a legitimate company, and they have to follow all the rules of the Ministry of Labour—the number of apprentices, the ratio system in the apprenticeship system. They might be paying their taxes and paying the full amount of money, and everything they have to do to survive in business.", "What happens is, they could be in an area—say, for example, a cottage area—where new cottages are being built. People will come up on a weekend with a load of electrical wire, they’ll wire up a cottage or something, and they won’t get any inspections done on it. They buy their wire at Home Depot or Canadian Tire or something, so they’re doing the job cheaper, and they’re doing it without any inspections. That’s work that the local contractor didn’t get that he was actually qualified to do.", "Yet the College of Trades enforcement division will go after the local contractor over whether he’s got the right number of apprentices or not, and these guys—we call them “fly-by-nights,” guys who work out of their trunks—get away scot-free. You can complain to the College of Trades, and no will go after that guy. No one is going to go into a cottage road on a Saturday afternoon in the summer to see if some guy’s doing a job illegally. They’ll go after the guy—9 to 5, Monday to Thursday—and make sure that he hasn’t got a labourer or a 17-year-old kid out of high school working on a construction site who’s not an actual apprentice.", "These are the things that are not being addressed at the College of Trades. We can fix up these bills, like Bill 85, which makes a minor amendment to the College of Trades act. What I’m saying, Mr. Speaker, is the College of Trades isn’t working. It’s simply not working here in Ontario.

Whether it be shell games with our assets to disguise a long-entrenched Liberal government spending addiction, taking money from health care to pay the interest on the debt or picking winners and losers for transit funding, the Ontario budget’s direction to build Ontario up points us toward continued economic and labour turmoil that threatens to tear Ontario down.", "There are so many areas for improvement, Speaker. As Bill 85 does address the Highway Traffic Act to improve transportation in Ontario, I do want to highlight the many concerns for improved transportation and transit infrastructure that the bill leaves untouched. As I noted earlier, this government’s budget announcement and its series of high-profile transit announcements in the preceding weeks saw the Wynne Liberals continue their practice of picking winners and losers, where winners receive funding for LRT or regional express rail while others are left wondering if the Wynne Liberal government will ever deliver on promises in their area.", "Take the $1.6 billion for funding of the Hurontario LRT, while folks in Hamilton, who were also promised full funding, continue to wait at the end of the table for whatever scraps the government may have left to throw them. Meanwhile, we have the regional government in Waterloo, where I’m from, which was originally promised two-thirds funding for their LRT by the provincial Liberals—funding which was subsequently dropped to only a third, leaving municipal taxpayers on the hook that those in Mississauga and Brampton somehow evaded. That’s a true story, Speaker.", "Where’s the fairness? Where’s the consistency? I submit that if we’re looking for ways to improve government, we may want to start by ensuring we’re not just making our transit plans up as we go along. It’s the same situation with regional express rail, the key component for delivery of the all-day, two-way GO promise this government has made to residents in my area of Kitchener-Waterloo and to many throughout the province.", "Yes, the minister and the Premier did go to great lengths to get in front of cameras and strike up the band to cheer on regional express rail to Barrie, yet after months of promising all-day, two-way service for the people of Kitchener-Waterloo, expansions on the Kitchener line sadly weren’t even mentioned.", "While the Premier had indicated expanded GO train service would happen “immediately” prior to the election, and the former minister said it could actually happen within five years, the onslaught of new transit announcements contain no mention of when the promised two-way, all-day service the people of Barrie are now welcoming will ever make its way to the region of Waterloo.", "Commuters in Waterloo region have been given the impression again and again that two-way, all-day GO service, with frequent trains going east—that’s important—and westbound—even more important—all day long, was just around the corner: Buy your ticket now. Now, I don’t even think it’s clear what this government is committed to.", "To add insult to injury, after announcing the Wynne Liberal government plan for selling off Hydro One to supposedly pay for transit priorities, the budget is now telling municipalities who have yet to be allocated provincial funding for their rail extension projects to sell off their assets of their—" ],

That was actually mentioned in the budget.", "Look, we could be here all day. I’ve only got so much time left, because I am sharing with the member from Dufferin–Caledon. That said, when it comes to Bill 85’s parameters regarding improvements to the Highway Traffic Act, I feel it’s a bit like, in the words of Yogi Berra, “déjà vu all over again.” That’s because it was only a few short weeks ago that I was debating a bill in this House attempting to amend the Highway Traffic Act to include penalties for drug-impaired driving as part of the government’s Bill 31, Making Ontario’s Roads Safer Act. Those penalties proposed by this government, however, never even actually saw the light of day for third reading. That’s because government members at committee on day 1 of clause-by-clause had, in a bizarre turn of events, voted out a pertinent section of their own bill that had impacted the sections penalizing drug-impaired driving.", "So here we go again, Speaker. When it comes to Bill 31, and now Bill 85’s direction with regard to drug-impaired driving, I will repeat what I said a number of weeks ago. We all agree that those impaired, whether from alcohol or drugs, should not be driving, period. We all agree on that. The fact is that Ontario is one of only three jurisdictions in Canada that currently has no sanctions for drug-impaired driving. So the issue finally being addressed again here allows Ontario motorists to have the protection that the other provinces already benefit from. We already have laws to deal with the impacts of drunk driving, so this bill proposes to fill the void in Ontario to take on the impact of drugged driving.", "Specifically, the bill will allow for someone’s driver’s licence to be suspended for three, seven, 30 or 90 days if a driver fails a roadside test and the police officer, trained in standardized field sobriety testing or as a drug recognition expert, reasonably believes that their ability to drive is impaired, depending on the level of impairment.", "We’ve now moved eight years down the road since federal law changes were made to give police new powers to compel suspected drug-impaired drivers to take roadside sobriety tests. While there are a number of technologies out there for testing, whether through a type of breathalyzer or saliva testing, many questions remain with regard to both civil liberties and the actual science behind the procedures.", "Question one surrounds the fact that, unlike the 0.08% threshold for blood alcohol concentration, there’s no scientific consensus about how much consumption of certain drugs will cause impairment. Some hold that five nanograms per millilitre of blood should be the limit for cannabis, while others have said it should be 10. Yet even as the debate continues, the fact remains that it’s the responsibility of us as legislators to address issues surrounding drug-impaired driving because of the harms it may cause.", "While we know that many of the problems associated with drug-impaired driving are similar to those associated with drunk driving, there is substantial evidence suggesting that the prevalence of drug-impaired driving may be higher than that of alcohol-impaired driving. And while we’re not just talking about marijuana use, there are studies pointing to the fact that driving under the influence of marijuana alone may be more common than drunk driving. That’s a significant concern. According to the Partnership For a Drug-Free Canada, “Cannabis significantly affects the skills necessary for driving. Cannabis causes euphoria, slowed thinking, confusion, impaired memory and learning, increased heart rate and anxiety. These effects are felt within minutes, peak after about half an hour and can last up to two hours.” They go on to report that “driving while on cannabis demonstrates slowed thinking, which delays reaction time to important events occurring on the road. It also distorts time and distance perception, making it difficult for the driver to navigate turns into oncoming traffic. Concentration and attention span are also decreased, increasing the likelihood that the driver will be distracted from watching the road. The crash rate of cannabis users can be anywhere from two to six times higher than sober drivers, depending on the duration and quantity of the drug.", "“Considerable evidence from both real and simulated driving studies indicates that marijuana can negatively affect a driver’s attentiveness, perception of time and speed, and the ability to draw on information obtained from past experiences.”", "The studies continue. I think I saw an ad on the subway the other day calling for volunteer pot smokers between the ages of 17 and 24 who own a driver’s licence to come forward for another study examining the impacts here in the city of Toronto. One of the latest studies from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health estimates that “4% to 12% of motor vehicle deaths or injuries occurred under the influence of cannabis. Based on motor vehicle accident statistics from 2010, this suggests that there were 89 to 267 fatalities, and 6,625 to 20,475 injuries in Canada that year related to cannabis use.” This is a cause for concern.", "Beyond marijuana, the drug-impaired driving problem extends much further, to include the use of a wide variety of both legal and illegal drugs, running the gamut from stimulants, depressants, antidepressants, narcotics, hallucinogens and sleeping pills, among other intoxicating substances. So there is little doubt that we need to get a handle on how to address the dire impacts that can result due to any and all types of impaired driving, and yet even as we support the direction toward dealing with the occurrence of drug-impaired driving, we recognize that there will be concerns moving forward.", "I remain concerned that with government yet to introduce any reliable scientific testing for drug impairment, the imposition of penalties is left open to question and possible legal challenge. The fact remains that while government has spoken about examining testing procedures in other jurisdictions until some verifiable type of roadside breathalyzer for drugs is proven valid and accurate, we will require further detail, if the legislation moves on to committee, as to how and when a driver is determined to be drug-impaired for the purposes of this legislation.", "I know I’ve only got a few minutes left." ],

That’s contained in this bill. There is no doubt that the safety of our medical transportation services is important, but given the Liberal government’s track record in areas of overseeing medical transportation in the past, we do remain skeptical of government’s ability to regulate those services.", "I want to remind folks, as it pertains to this bill, that it was just less than a year ago that the Standing Committee on Public Accounts issued a comprehensive, scathing report after a two-year investigation into the Ornge air ambulance scandal. It’s not entirely surprising that many in this House today are unaware of the report—I encourage them to pick up a copy and over the long weekend, if they’ve not already read it, to please do so—because just as it was about to be released publicly, the Premier called an election, successfully burying what she knew would be a highly critical report.

It’s becoming a real issue, because there do not seem to be any standards in place that ensure that the fee or charge is appropriate or consistent.", "I actually have very disturbing examples from an emergency room nurse who has told me directly that people are now making decisions that say, “Don’t send my mom or dad”—who is in a long-term-care home—“to the hospital, because I don’t want to pay—or I cannot afford to pay—the fee of the non-emergency transfer” that occurs when they leave the emergency room and go back to the long-term-care home.", "I have very, very serious concerns with the fact that we need to take a much closer look at that industry and ensure not only that the staff who are manning these vehicles are appropriately trained, but that there is some comfort and consistency in how the costs are decided upon.", "If people are actually making a decision that they do not want their loved one to go to the emergency room because they can’t afford the return trip in that non-medical transfer vehicle, because they don’t have a vehicle that would be appropriate for a wheelchair or the particular circumstances, I think we have a bigger issue than what is specifically referenced in schedule 7 with the amendments that are being proposed here with Bill 85.", "Sometimes we learn about these issues just because we get the calls from the constituency. It had not occurred to me that there would be an inconsistency in the rules—well, let’s be honest; there are no rules. There don’t seem to be any rules as to what cost is appropriate. I would like to see more of that studied, whether it’s through the Ministry of Health, or if we want to do it with schedule 7 through the Ministry of Transportation, I don’t really care. What I do care about is, I don’t want to be in a position where people are saying no to going to the hospital for specific services that they need; perhaps it’s a physiotherapy session, and they are concerned that they will not be able to afford the charge that happens at the end of the program.", "I would urge the government to look at that and come up with a solution where there is an appropriate and easily understood, transparent view for people to see what is covered under the non-emergency transfers and what is the appropriate cost for it. Perhaps it’s a situation where you need to have a maximum fee. We often talk about the very important value we have in our universal health care.

I am very proud to stand before this House as we—all Ontarians—mark Children and Youth in Care Day.", "Monsieur le Président, je suis fière de m’adresser à cette Assemblée alors que nous, et tous les Ontariens et Ontariennes, soulignons le Jour des enfants et des jeunes pris en charge.", "In 2014, our government proclaimed May 14 of every year as Children and Youth in Care Day. Today, we recognize the strengths and resilience shown by these children.", "I’m happy to introduce 120 youth in care and their chaperones here today in the House—many in the gallery, I see—who were with me earlier attending a Youth Civics Day reception, hosted by the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies and the Ontario Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth.", "They’re all here to celebrate this important day and also learn about the Legislature, how their democratic institutions operate, and to meet their local representatives. This day is an opportunity to raise awareness about children and youth of the province and to reaffirm our commitment to supporting them in reaching their full potential.", "It was in 2011, when I had just become an MPP, that young people currently and formerly in the care of children’s aid societies told us of their personal journeys during the Youth Leaving Care Hearings right here at Queen’s Park. As a new legislator at the time, I remember hearing the stories and being very humbled by them, and I was very inspired by their courage.", "Building on those hearings, a Youth Leaving Care Working Group was established to build a plan for change to Ontario’s child welfare system. The final report, called a Blueprint for Fundamental Change to Ontario’s Child Welfare System, told us that children and youth in care need stability in their relationships. They need support to succeed in education and need help with transitions while in care and when leaving care.", "Our government has listened carefully and we continue to take action. Notre gouvernement a été à l’écoute et nous continuons à prendre des mesures concrètes.", "These young people now have access to a range of new resources and supports that will help them stay in school, pursue post-secondary education and training, and maintain stronger relationships, all to help them better prepare for leaving care.", "For example, we know how important a good education is. That’s why our government is providing $2,000 a semester, through the Living and Learning Grant, to youth formerly in care enrolled in OSAP-eligible post-secondary and training programs, to assist them with their living expenses. We also expanded eligibility so that more youth can receive the Ontario Access Grant for Crown Wards. This grant covers 50% of tuition, up to $3,000 per year. And we partnered with 30 post-secondary education institutions across the province to cover the full cost of tuition for crown wards and former youth in care.", "Our government also knows how important stability is to young people who have experienced upheaval. That’s why we’ve increased the minimum monthly financial support for youth leaving care to $850, and that’s why we are funding 60 youth-in-transition workers to help youth in and leaving care to access the services they need in their communities. And we’ve partnered with the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies to introduce the new Aftercare Benefits Initiative that provides former youth in care with access to prescription drugs, dental and extended health benefits.", "And our work continues.", "We are developing new resources and training for our front-line staff and caregivers of LGBTQ children and youth in and leaving care. And we’re developing mentorship resources so children and youth in care are supported as they transition to adulthood.", "All of these initiatives have been informed and developed with youth, by youth, and we’ll continue to engage youth as we move forward.", "Formally recognizing children and youth in the province’s care through a Children and Youth in Care Day will help keep the issues that affect the lives of children and youth in and from care in the public spotlight, and it will remind this House and all Ontarians to stay focused on the children and youth who depend on us." ],

However, it’s only the first time we can dedicate the appropriate time to recognizing this occasion in the Legislature, as last year the date fell in the middle of a provincial election.", "I’d like to begin by thanking all members who made the Children and Youth in Care Day possible, including the member from Scarborough–Agincourt, who sponsored Bill 53 and made today’s events possible.", "Being taken into care is undoubtedly a shocking experience for any child, as the familiar environment they grew up in is taken away from them. There are many reasons for a child to need care. Parents can become sick, incapacitated or addicted. Sometimes children have to be rescued from abusive environments. It is imperative, therefore, to ensure that the care system works for the child and eases their transition into and out of the system.", "In 2011, the Legislature held the Youth Leaving Care Hearings, the first of their kind in Canada, giving a voice to those who should have had a say all along in the care system they had to experience. We heard how children and youth in care often felt left out of the decision-making about their own lives, or left without supports following their exit from care. Clearly, as legislators, we could do and had to do better.", "Currently, there are 48,000 families being followed by children’s aid societies, and 23,000 children in care. While the total number may be decreasing, the challenges they face aren’t. Sometimes they are compounded by the current regulatory environment around children and youth in care, which can place them in a no-win choice.", "For instance, we heard in the pre-budget consultations from the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies that an adopted older youth will pay for the stability of a permanent home with the loss of many educational supports, such as those for higher education, that they would have continued to receive if they had stayed a child in care.", "For other youths aged 16 and 17, a sudden need for first-time children’s aid society services is bound to be unmet as the Child and Family Services Act bans CASs from helping 16- and 17-year-olds who haven’t been one of their clients beforehand. These youths are left to navigate the difficult nexus between the child support system they are too old for and the adult system that sees them as too young.", "Moreover, agencies trusted to manage care arrangements for Ontario’s children in need are facing the prospect of the delayed implementation of the Child Protection Information Network by as much as five years. As it is rolled out, we see the close technical cousin of CPIN—SAMS—causing widespread concern among agencies regarding the system’s accuracy and stability.", "Children’s aid societies are also feeling the pressure of stagnant or decreasing funding. In my own riding of Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry, the CAS is facing the real prospect of having to cut services in order to stay afloat. At this time, when the prevention workload is increasing, this kind of neglect puts more children at risk of requiring being taken into care, rather than being followed in their own families. This is unacceptable.", "As the critic for children and youth services, I will continue to pressure the government to address these challenges as children’s lives and well-being are at stake. They deserve nothing short of a total and unconditional commitment to their safety, happiness and success. This year marks a particularly important step in addressing these failures in the design of our care system as the Child and Family Services Act undergoes a thorough review.", "As we celebrate children and youth in care, we must keep in mind our promise to them: to make it easier for them and their families to leave the care system sooner, easier, happier and better." ],

What the hearings and the report demonstrated was that children and youth in care have something to say—they want to be heard and they want to contribute to make the system work for those children who will follow behind them.", "Speaker, their voice is essential as we move forward, and the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth has continued to promote youth engagement through the I Do Care Project and Feathers of Hope, an initiative that engages First Nation youth.", "Today, allow me to hand the floor over to a few of those youth in the only way I can in this chamber—by giving a voice to their words.", "From Patricia: “I have come to learn that the most important things in life are family and permanency. Less changes in a youth-in-care’s life means more time to focus on something else like post-secondary education.”", "Brandon said, “I already had my family taken away once, and it was probably the hardest thing in my life. I didn’t know where else to turn or what I was going to do, and when I turn 21, it’s all going to happen again.”", "For First Nations children, the problems are often exaggerated. One aboriginal child, who chose not to be named, said this: “I did not have a say if I wanted to attend my cultural things as in pow-wows or sweat lodges. Instead, I went to church.”", "These are a few of the quotes from My Real Life Book that indicate how much we have to do. We are all aware of the tragic stories that highlight some of the failures of our system.", "But the report includes some comments that reflect good experiences and offer some hope for the future if we attack the problems and learn from our successes.", "Kayla, for example, was well-served by the system. She said, “My CAS worker is like the dad I never had. And since my CYW has taken me under her wing, I know I can get through pretty much anything.”", "These differing experiences can perhaps be explained by a recent media report which highlights disparities in our child welfare system across the province. From an analysis of reports received by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services, it was apparent that the services children in care received depended to a great extent on where that child lived. Significant variations were found in areas such as availability of social and health services, availability of foster homes, the use of group homes, and the number of placements that were imposed on children.", "One of the recommendations made by the Youth Leaving Care Hearings Team was to commit to collecting and publishing information on how children in care are doing. They recognized three years ago that this information was essential, but the government has pretty much ignored that recommendation.", "The inquest into the tragic death of Jeffrey Baldwin recommended that a database be established for the entire province by February of next year. The government says they won’t deliver until 2020. That’s almost 20 years after Jeffrey died.", "The Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth has said the system is “at best fragmented and at worst confused.”", "Millions and millions of dollars are being spent on a database system that can’t be used for another five years, and the relationship between it and the failed SAMS system is not lost on anyone.", "This government needs to understand its responsibility to children and youth in care goes beyond handing $1.5 billion to 46 agencies to do the job in the way that they see fit. They have a responsibility to ensure the well-being of children wherever they may live.", "Speaker, Children and Youth in Care Day serves as a reminder each year of the responsibility we share to provide a safe environment where children in the care of the province can flourish and prepare themselves for successful, fulfilling lives as adults.", "And it is very much our responsibility. When we take a child into care, we assume the role of parents, and who among us in this chamber who are parents do not see that as the primary responsibility in our lives?", "I will give Justine, a former youth in care, the final word: “We are your children, Ontario.”" ],

  "text" : [ "I rise today to introduce my private member’s motion on the creation of a provincial task force to combat human trafficking.", "Human trafficking is a very serious issue that is currently plaguing our province. Not nearly enough is being done to raise public awareness, to help victims of human trafficking when they break free from their trafficker, or to effectively prosecute and convict the perpetrators of this heinous crime.", "Many people think of human trafficking as a faraway problem, one that conjures up images of desperate young women brought to Canada under false pretenses, lorded over by violent, leering men who take pleasure in forcing the helpless into a life of brutal servitude. This characterization, while maybe slightly fantastical, is not incorrect. But if this is the sole impression one has of human trafficking—which I’m afraid is the case with many people—they are misinformed about its scope and pervasiveness in our great province and country. While you may think human trafficking doesn’t affect us, it does.", "The misconceptions are many. One might think that the majority of human trafficking victims are foreign-born, imported for this form of modern slavery, but in reality, at least 97% of victims are Canadian-born. This province is home to the largest number of domestic human trafficking cases, where victims are born and raised right here in Ontario. One might think that the victims are forcibly plucked off the street by a shadowy, unknown man pulling the strings that control their life, but in reality, about 85% of victims were recruited through human contact, and 34% were in the sex trade and pimped by their boyfriend.", "Young women are lured in through personal relationships, systemically isolated from family and friends, psychologically and physically abused by those they trusted and, in some cases, loved.", "Victims are sexually exploited, earning their traffickers over $280,000 per year for just one victim. Traffickers advertise the sexual services of their victims, some as young as 14, through online ads and social media. I’ve been told that on any given day, about 500 of those online sex ads are for victims of human trafficking.", "To make progress in our fight against human trafficking, we need to make serious changes to the way in which we combat it. This means changing public perception of who is a victim of human trafficking, because, quite frankly, she is the girl next door. She’s the pretty and popular girl who hopes no one ever finds out that deep down inside she doesn’t feel pretty at all. She’s the girl who never wants her parents to learn about the embarrassing pictures taken of her at a house party. She’s the lonely girl who is often seen walking home alone from school.", "I’ve heard stories of girls being targeted at the mall food court, the parking lot at their high school or a house party they attended with friends. This is in stark contrast to how many people perceive human trafficking and it shows that while at-risk individuals do face the greatest threat of being trafficked, human trafficking is a scourge that can affect anyone, no matter their background or socio-economic status.", "Regardless of how these victims are brought into the system of human trafficking, victims are constantly in danger. Victims are manipulated by their trafficker and removed from their normal life to live and work in horrific conditions. They may also face fatal consequences if they attempt to escape.", "The crime represents a consistent and pervasive assault on the fundamental human rights of its victims. A report entitled The Incidence of Human Trafficking in Ontario from the Alliance Against Modern Slavery lays out the vastness of the human trafficking problem in Ontario and steps that can be taken to fix it.", "This organization does admirable work in combatting human trafficking worldwide and they, too, believe that a provincial task force is necessary. In its report, the alliance found that 96.5% of victims experience some form of violence and that over half of them were held captive for some period of time.", "These shocking and horrifying statistics make it clear that there is no time to waste when it comes to taking action on human trafficking. There is an immediate need to change how we investigate and prosecute the criminals behind the human trafficking rings.", "The problem does not stop when these victims are found. This week in the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment, we heard from two survivors of human trafficking who now work with NGOs to help others.", "Casandra Diamond from BridgeNorth spoke of the very unique needs when delivering services to victims. She explained, “When I’m working with women, I care about the recidivism rate. I don’t want them going back. So there are two things that we have to concern ourselves with.... Housing is primary. Then it’s like a tie for second: counselling and job opportunities. Because if you cannot make enough money to provide for yourself or your family, again, the vacuum just sucks you right back up and you’re stuck.”", "We also heard from Katarina MacLeod, who spoke about the difference in victim service needs of those who have been exploited in the sex trade from those who have experienced sexual violence or harassment. “It’s totally different,” she said. “Abuse is abuse regardless of where it happens, how it happens, but when there’s sexual exploitation, there’s something that changes inside of you. There’s a shift in the way you feel, in the way you think, how you think men are. Your body is being used and degraded over and over again. You’re being raped every day for a service that is provided to men. So the long-term damage that is happening to these women is very crucial, and I, being one of them, am still suffering and will probably suffer the rest of my life.”", "We need to change how we interact with and help survivors. This is why I’m proposing the immediate implementation of a provincial task force to combat human trafficking, in the same style as the provincial guns and gangs task force. This would improve province-wide coordination in fighting human trafficking. The guns and gangs unit includes police officers, crown prosecutors and victim assistance workers, who all collaborate from the first day of the investigation. Through this combination of expertise, the task force achieves the dual purpose of apprehending criminals and also assisting their victims. The guns and gangs task force has been successful, and the implementation of a similar structure regarding human trafficking is crucial.", "Currently, jurisdictions are independently investigating trafficking crimes, but given these crimes’ highly transient nature, the efforts of law enforcement are hindered by multiple investigations of the same perpetrator of crimes in multiple areas. Under the proposed task force, investigation and prosecution would be coordinated between the different police services, making for easier and faster criminal proceedings and hopefully resulting in a prosecution rate higher than the 25% that it is currently. From survivors and experts, we know that victims are moved from community to community, particularly along Highway 401, which makes information-sharing between multiple jurisdictions crucial.", "It would also help victims, as the current way in which human trafficking victims are assisted is extremely patchwork and not comprehensive. Groups such as Covenant House in Toronto are doing remarkable work in trying to help those victims who make the decision to break free of their captors. However, the overall quantity and effectiveness of services available to victims is well below what it should be. This is not because the advocates and social workers are not trying hard enough; rather, it is because the current system makes it extremely difficult for places like Covenant House not only to immediately help victims but also to keep them safe and away from the clutches of their abusers.", "One aspect where a provincial task force would be immeasurable would be its ability to help facilitate the creation of safe houses solely for the purpose of sheltering human trafficking victims. Currently, no such facility exists. Victims end up at a variety of already-existing shelters, but these are not specifically suited for them. Whether it is due to the focus of the shelter or certain restrictions on entrance, like age, victims of human trafficking often end up back in the clutches of their abusers after only a few days in a shelter.", "Recognizing this problem, Interval House, a centre for abused women and children, tried to set up a human-trafficking-specific safe house in Ottawa. However, they were unable to obtain provincial funding necessary to be able to complete the project.", "Mr. Speaker, this is a tragedy, but luckily one that can be rectified. Safe houses specifically for human trafficking victims are a necessity because these victims’ needs are different from the needs of victims of other crimes. Particularly, they urgently require one-on-one companionship with support staff and access to a trauma counsellor.", "The Alliance Against Modern Slavery report notes that the first 72 hours with a trafficking victim are crucial. If they are not helped within this time period, they are significantly more likely to fall back into the life they were so desperately trying to escape.", "Additionally, trafficking victims often require longer-term assistance than is provided in the current facilities that are available to them. They are usually pushed out after a specific time when they are deemed to be able to reintegrate, as opposed to a more flexible schedule based around the individual healing and recovery process.", "There is a need to train police, prosecutors and particularly judges on the unique nature of human trafficking, especially how these victims recall and recount memories. Probation officers need training to identify victims, as many of these young women find themselves in the judicial system. Nurses and doctors need training to identify victims, as many may be brought into the ER or treated for sexually transmitted diseases, injuries, or pregnancies. Lastly, municipal employees need training to identify victims, when many apply for an exotic dancing licence so that they are able to work in local bars.", "I’m reminded again of testimony from Casandra Diamond of BridgeNorth, who spoke to the select committee this week. She said, and I quote, “Violence against women and inequality are amplified when licensed. Each and every prostituted person, every day, would be able to make a claim under WSIB had they had been in any other industry.”", "I believe that we can—we must—attack this problem head-on, which is why I propose this private member’s motion. We cannot wait any longer to take action.", "Thank you." ],

As she pointed out, human trafficking is very much a women’s issue. We know that about two thirds of those who are trafficked are women and girls, and in virtually all cases of trafficking for the purposes of sex exploitation, the victims are women.", "Women are more vulnerable to trafficking because they are more likely to be poor. Poverty is one of the clearest risk factors for trafficking, and that’s particularly the case for immigrant or First Nations women. Another risk factor is low education. We know the kinds of barriers that First Nations people faced in accessing education or employment and the legacy of residential schools that continues to create barriers to First Nations women.", "But, of course, human trafficking does not only affect women; it also affects those who are children. About half of victims of trafficking are under 18 years of age. As the member said, the more high-profile cases involve people from other countries who are trafficked and brought to Canada to work as migrant workers on farms or construction sites, their papers and passports confiscated—forced to work without pay and without adequate food.", "New Democrats will be supporting the motion. We certainly agree that a task force would be a good idea. The little research that has been conducted on this issue suggests that Ontario is actually where the majority of victims of both foreign and domestic human trafficking live.", "There is clearly a need for much greater federal-provincial coordination on this issue. Other provinces—British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba—have all moved ahead to create formal task forces such as the one that is proposed, but Ontario has no formal anti-trafficking program in place, no system to deal with this issue.", "But we also want to emphasize that, more than just combatting human trafficking, which is what this motion calls on the government to do, what we need in this province is a system of supports to assist victims of trafficking. We need training and services for front-line agencies that are dealing with victims of trafficking, and for law enforcement officials. We also need to address root causes: poverty and lack of opportunity, as I mentioned.", "We know that in February 2011, the Ontario government announced just less than $2 million over three years to combat human trafficking, but in Manitoba, where they have about one thirteenth the population of Ontario, there has been a commitment of $10 million a year to fund anti-trafficking programs.", "I want to close with a quote from the research report that was completed in June of last year called The Incidence of Human Trafficking in Ontario. That report says, “Human trafficking victims in Ontario report inappropriate and inadequate services, along with frustration of lack of coordination and consistency in services provided. This frustration is echoed by dedicated law enforcement officers, service providers and NGOs who face barriers in providing and obtaining services for victims.”", "We know that a policing and enforcement response is important, but you can’t fight human trafficking without providing supports for the victims. You can’t only target the traffickers; you have to look after the victims, you have to invest in front-line services, and you have to address root causes." ],

I want to use my time to speak a bit about what investments have been made in Ontario and some of the initiatives we’re currently working on.", "Let me first say that we know what a devastating crime human trafficking is, and that women and girls are particularly vulnerable. Human trafficking for sexual and labour exploitation affects vulnerable people right across Canada. It’s a complicated issue that requires collaboration with community organizations, between ministries, police forces and international partners, which is why we did not wait for this motion today to take action on this issue. We have been front and centre in fighting against human trafficking.", "The Ontario Women’s Directorate and other government partners have been investing in programs aimed to prevent human trafficking, to improve law enforcement and the prosecution of offenders, and to ensure that victims receive the support they need. For example, an additional investment of $1 million to the Language Interpreter Services program was provided annually to expand services to victims of sexual violence, including human trafficking, to help them access health care, legal and social services they need, in more than 70 languages in various local communities.", "Last year, we provided $225,000 in funding to the White Ribbon Campaign to help it develop and promote resources that engage young men in ending human trafficking and other forms of sexual exploitation of women and girls.", "The Ministry of the Attorney General also provided support for the development of a comprehensive, province-wide online training program for front-line workers. The program became available to service providers at the end of January 2014.", "We are also working with our federal partners to support the implementation of the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking.", "A couple of things I just want to touch on that relate to the supports and services from community safety and correctional services: Since 2003, that ministry has provided funding to 11 projects, for a total of approximately $1.4 million under Ontario’s Proceeds of Crime Front Line Policing Grant Program, to help police services combat human trafficking in Ontario. These funds helped police with special investigations into this trade, created education campaigns for potential victims and witnesses, provided for increased surveillance and improved officer training, and supported human trafficking investigators.", "The OPP also worked closely with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency on several border enforcement teams that take a coordinated approach to organized crime, including human trafficking.", "In Ontario, we have launched a very coordinated approach to combat human trafficking and raise awareness of this very serious issue. There are a number of initiatives focused on prevention, enforcement and support for victims that the OPP, Peel region and Toronto police have provided. There are financial supports for projects driven by local police services to fight human trafficking in communities.", "There’s information, support and referral services available 24/7 in 150 languages; and additional supports to emergency services and community agencies to better assist victims of human trafficking.", "There are new specialized human trafficking crown attorneys to help build strong cases and prosecute offenders.", "And there’s been an awareness campaign to help victims.", "Ontario has established a human trafficking advisory committee as well, made up of police service reps, victim service providers, experts and survivors to provide advice on priorities and community needs.", "Our government will continue to work with our partners to combat this very serious issue." ],

While it is lovely to talk about what has happened, what the intention is or that another advisory committee has happened, these are young people who need help right now.

These are our children. These are 97% Canadian-born kids who need help today, right now.", "The police officers who have talked to us about human trafficking say that one of the things these human traffickers do is, they swap girls. They swap them from community to community, so that as soon as the OPP in Dufferin county starts to figure out there’s an issue, they take them and move them to Chatham. Then they stay in Chatham for a couple of days, and if it gets hot, they go to London. So there’s no ability for those local police officers who actually have a lot of front-line experience on this to actually get the job done, because the girls are being swapped. It’s a terrible, terrible story, and what we are hearing is, “The provincial task force will assist.” They’ve seen it succeed with the guns and gangs, and they know and they believe that it will help with human trafficking.", "So if we can do one thing this afternoon, let’s not get into this “We’re a Tory and we believe this,” and “We’re Liberal and we’ve already done this, so let’s move on.” Let’s actually do something that will proactively help our children, help our neighbours, and get moving on this provincial task force.", "While my colleague was speaking, I was very quickly going through all of the ministries that this scourge impacts, and it’s substantial: community safety and corrections—obvious; Attorney General—obvious; education; colleges and universities.", "One of the things they do is, they recruit off our college and university campuses the shy girl, the girl who takes a little longer to find friends.

How despicable is that?", "Finally, when you actually have the ability to pull some of these young ladies back: PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder. The young lady who appeared at the select committee this week had been out for something like three or four years. She’s going to therapy now.", "We can do something collectively, as parliamentarians, if we move forward and say, “Yes, we believe that the model that is already out there, which relates to the guns and gangs task force, can actually work with human trafficking.”", "Please set aside your stripes for a few hours this afternoon and move forward on this provincial task force.

But actually, victim services is still waiting for some funding from the Attorney General from 2012. It’s a consistent issue that victim services continually brings to this Legislature.", "There is also a mention of what’s happening at the federal level, and I think it’s safe to say that this motion is stronger than what is happening at the federal level—that’s very much focused on a policing perspective. The issue of human trafficking is so complex that you just don’t want to pick it up downstream when it gets to the police. The best solution is through education and through supporting people who have actually been through this cycle.", "Kitchener–Waterloo is a thriving economic community. Waterloo was voted one of the most intelligent communities in Ontario and Canada, and human trafficking is happening in our communities, right under our noses. What adds insult to injury for a lot of people, I think, is that when it is that girl next door, as other members have mentioned, when they actually have the courage to come forward and finally tell their story about being exploited, about being manipulated, about being used and exposed to a kind of violence that none of us would even like to think about—when they do come forward, the services are not there to help them through that process. In fact, they are re-victimized because of shame. There is absolutely so much more that we can be doing.", "It’s hard for me not to think about a healing circle that I attended in Kitchener, where a First Nations woman told her story about how she was literally lured into this circle by attention, by gifts, by promises of perhaps going to school—of education. She was completely and utterly manipulated, and then came the drugs and addiction, and the need to stay in that cycle of poverty and oppression and exploitation just to exist.", "And when she was finally, through a huge support network, actually pulled back out, she was tempted again and again to fall back into that cycle because there were no supports to hold her in place. The safe houses are absolutely a key part of that. These women live on the margins of society, and they live next door to us.

Every country in the world, including Canada, is affected by trafficking, whether as a country of origin, transit or destination for victims. In fact, trafficking does not necessarily involve any movement from one place to another. Traffickers reap large benefits and profits while robbing victims of their freedom and their dignity.", "Trafficking victims are some of the most vulnerable and marginalized individuals in our society—held against their will; deprived of their dignity and their identity documents; forced to work or provide services ranging from forced labour to commercial sexual exploitation to organ trading to forced servile marriages.", "Victims are subject to sexual abuse, threats, intimidation, physical violence and isolation, and for victims who find themselves in such situations, escape can be very difficult and dangerous. Furthermore, those who do escape face tremendous challenges in reintegration, due to stigmatization and intolerance, and many of them may already have fallen afoul of the criminal justice system.", "Unfortunately, organized crime and its deep underground human trafficking networks are difficult to detect and investigate. This is why it’s so important to provide our protection agencies with the extra resources and training they need to combat human trafficking.", "Since 2003, the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services has provided funding to 11 projects of a total of approximately $1.4 million under the proceeds-of-crime front-line policing grant.

Similarly, the Ontario Provincial Police are working closely with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency on coordinating approaches to human trafficking. To help build strong prosecution cases, Ontario has also established new specialized human trafficking crown attorneys.", "Due to the dreadful accumulated trauma that trafficking victims have experienced, agency support and assistance are essential to help those affected to recover and piece their lives back together.

L’exploitation comprend, au minimum, l’exploitation de la prostitution d’autrui ou d’autres formes d’exploitation sexuelle, le travail ou les services forcés, l’esclavage ou les pratiques analogues à l’esclavage, la servitude ou le prélèvement d’organes. »", "I was participating in an international forum on this topic, and I was shocked when the statistics for Canada were presented. I thought that this is something that happened elsewhere; this is not something that happens in Ontario or in Canada. No, no, this is something that happens in Third World countries—not at all, Speaker, not at all.", "The RCMP presented the statistics in black and white, and it is enough to make you cry. Did you know that right here, right now, in Ontario we can expect that there are at least 240 women who are being sexually exploited and who need our protection? Did you know that right here, right now, in Ontario there are at least 320 people, mainly women, being exploited to work in private people’s homes? They are only the tip of the iceberg. Those are the statistics that the RCMP could give us, but they were really clear that the situation is way worse than what they were able to present, because what they were able to present was people they have been able to identify, but of course a lot of what goes on—nobody ever knows those people are even there.", "They went on to say that people who come from other countries will transit through Ontario to find their way to the States. This human trafficking route mainly takes the route of Ontario or British Columbia, and the numbers are staggering. We’re talking 2,200 people going through Ontario and British Columbia through the human trafficking trade. None of this I knew even existed.", "When I was presented with this, we saw what other countries internationally are doing and, let me tell you, Speaker, they are doing a whole lot more than we are doing here in Ontario. Some of it could be basically copied as to what they’ve done in France and Belgium, in some of the other western countries of Europe, and brought here if only we had this task force to start to talk about it, to have an open dialogue. I have no problem patting ourselves on the back for the little steps we have taken, but there is so much more we can do. We should do this for those 240 women who are presently being used as sexual slaves, and we should do this for the 320 mostly women and children who are being abused as domestics." ],

This is a disturbing, horrible crime that robs its victims, who are mostly women and young children, of their most basic human rights and freedoms. They are forced into labour or sexual services, often through coercive practices like intimidation, force, sexual assault and threats of violence to themselves or their families. Those who are socially or economically disadvantaged—aboriginal women, youth, children, new immigrants, teenage runaways—are at greater risk of becoming victims.", "Between 2011 and 2013, there were 551 reported cases of human trafficking that were at least in some way linked to Ontario. Of course, this doesn’t take into account the unreported crimes. And contrary to popular belief, it’s not just international citizens who are targeted as victims. In 2010, a study estimated that 71% of all cases of human trafficking in Canada involved domestic sex trafficking. That same study found that 63% of victims of trafficking cases in the province of Ontario were Canadian citizens. Imagine that, Mr. Speaker. For so many of us here in the House—parents, grandparents—the thought of someone from our families or friends or neighbours being taken and forced into what basically amounts to modern-day slavery is horrifying. These victims are being beaten, emotionally abused, and live in constant fear. They need help, and we have a duty to help these victims.", "But I am pleased to say that our government has not been blind to these deeply troubling and significant issues. Ontario has been and continues to be front and centre in the fight against human trafficking, but we recognize that there is more work to do.", "Since 2003, the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services has provided funding to 11 projects. There has also been the establishment of a human trafficking advisory committee, and we are working with the human trafficking committee with the Pan/Parapan Am Games jointly.", "I’m sure that we can all agree that these are despicable crimes and that perpetrators must be pursued and brought to justice.

That’s kind of what’s going on with human trafficking. It’s an invisible epidemic.", "I want to just quote from a study. The author of the study said, “Child sexual exploitation is the most hidden form of child abuse in the U.S. and North America today.”", "I want to remind everybody that human trafficking often involves children. It involves young girls. It can involve boys, as well, but it is predominantly women who are subjected to it. These are lives ruined—not just the girls themselves, but their entire families are forever shaken up.", "As awful as it is for any of us to imagine losing a child, in a way this is worse, because there’s no closure. You know that your child is always out there somewhere suffering, because even if you can get them off the streets, it’s hard to get them rehabilitated and get them the help they need.", "I’ve been given some information from Peter Casey. He’s a detective sergeant with York Regional Police. What he has explained to me is that York Regional Police has created a vice team to combat human trafficking, and they’ve been very successful. They went from a unit enforcing and charging sex trade workers to a unit that recognizes that the vast majority of women and girls involved in the sex trade are victims—so to help them, not be treating them as the criminals. The criminals are the johns and the pimps. This York Regional Police vice team did not charge a single female with solicitation over that seven-year period. So they completely changed the way that they’re operating. They’re taking this new approach, working with all kinds of community organizations and trying to train others, and they definitely want to see a provincial task force similar to the guns and gangs task force, which we all know was so successful.", "I think that there should be support here in the Legislature. Why? Because I think that there’s support at home. The people who put us here want us to do better in terms of combatting human trafficking. They’re upset when it’s their daughter who has gone missing and they hear that girls can be moved around from town to town and hotel to hotel, and the police put up their arms and say, “We have no jurisdiction to go in over there.”", "So, Mr. Speaker, I urge everybody here to do better, to create that task force.

It’s about prioritizing this last phase, the third phase of Highway 3. It is also a promise that I made to my community during the last election to fight for the completion of this phase of the highway. I’m happy to use my first private member’s slot since the election to do so. It’s something that I want to see, that our community wants to see: for this government to finish what they started.", "The stretch from Leamington to Windsor on Highway 3 is about a 50-kilometre stretch. Historically, it was a two-lane highway, and my predecessor, Bruce Crozier, a man who held the seat for 17 years, saw fit to fight and to lobby the government—as a member of the government—to widen that highway. He garnered large support from community members, stakeholders, businesses and municipalities for that endeavour and he was successful. He committed a large portion of his career to ensuring that that link, that vital throughway, was completed. It was aptly named for him, unfortunately, after he’d retired and after he’d passed.", "However, it’s come to the attention of myself and to our community that the plan has changed. In 2006, the government had approved this project. It promised that it would be completed by 2014-15. But now we’re seeing that the government is potentially poised to delay the project and potentially by a generation. We know that the greenhouse industry in Leamington, Kingsville and southwestern Ontario; the winery industry—we have dozens of world-class wineries that are in operation. And the tourism industry—Pelee Island and the Erie coast peninsula is really a wonderful, burgeoning tourism destination and something that requires connectivity and something that requires good infrastructure. This is vital to our region. It’s an integral component to our growth. If there was ever an area in Ontario that we know requires economic generation and stimulus, it is southwestern Ontario. Windsor and Essex county have, unfortunately, the highest unemployment rate in the province. That’s not a distinction that we like, but despite our efforts to do the right thing and to attract those jobs, we’re not feeling as though we have a partner, especially when it comes to the infrastructure needs of this highway.", "The EA, the environmental assessment, was performed in 2006 and was granted for this project. The Highway 3 expansion was split into three phases. Phase 1 and phase 2 are completed, and they are wonderful. They’re double-laned and they provide smooth transit for commuters who are coming into Windsor.", "They also link up to what we all know now, today, is being named the Gordie Howe International Bridge. Now, we can argue whether that’s appropriately named, the new bridge that will cross from Windsor into Detroit; however, that Highway 3 link connects to the Herb Gray Parkway, which then will connect to the Gordie Howe bridge. It’s going to allow us to grow and to blossom; no pun intended in reference to our greenhouse industry. But they desperately need this connectivity, and when you get to the point where phase 2 has ended, you find a massive bottleneck. It’s an 80-kilometre highway, and people hit that 80 kilometres at 110, as we typically drive on 80-kilometre highways. So we need that widening, not only for connectivity and for our economic growth needs, but there are incredible safety implications that demand that we do this, and do this now.", "Speaker, I introduced a petition signed by many members of our community two weeks ago, and unfortunately, three hours later a rollover accident claimed the lives of two people on that stretch of highway, the exact same stretch that I’m speaking of. It was a terrible example of why we need this, but all the more reason for the government to act swiftly to deliver what they promised.", "I come from a region where we value the virtue of doing what you say you’re going to do. When you say you’re going to do something, do it, and if you can’t do it, come up with a good reason; tell us why you can’t do it. But if you are going to do something, stay true to your word.

It’s certainly something that we know is needed. It’s something that Bruce fought for from the beginning of his tenure in 1993, something that is widely supported by municipalities. There are letters of endorsement that I’ve sent to the minister from the county of Essex that support my motion. Mayor John Paterson in Essex and Deputy Mayor Richard Meloche expressed frustration at the recent announcement, asking why the plan doesn’t include the long-promised expansion of the road to four lanes.", "Here’s maybe a point that I didn’t raise or I forgot to raise: The MTO has recently initiated a—they are going to resurface at the bottleneck portion. So we’re going to have that phase 3 resurfaced, which gives us concern. Why would we resurface a road that is already planned to be doubled and widened? We will then be wasting money. You’re going to lay down asphalt and, according to the plan, you’ll have to rip it up by 2018 if you’re going to fulfill your commitment under the southern highways plan. That’s our concern: that by resurfacing, the signal is that we will lose this doubling of the last phase for a generation. We can’t afford that. Our community can’t afford it. Our small businesses can’t afford it. Our tourism area can’t afford it. And certainly the safety of commuters on that highway doesn’t deserve it. We deserve what we were promised by this government, and that’s what this motion is today. Fulfill your promise. Finish what Bruce started and deliver vital infrastructure to southwestern Ontario.", "Speaker, the greenhouse industry in Leamington is at this very moment ready to invest half a billion dollars in our area, boosting the economy by something like $580 million a year.

However, this is a promise that is not linked to the 2014 budget. It isn’t linked to the 2011 budget or the 2008 budget. This is a promise that was made in 2006.", "Today, when I asked the question of the Minister of Transportation, he seemed offended that I would even ask that we want you to finish the job. He seemed offended: “My goodness, why would you even ask the question?” It has been since 2006. How much more time do you need, Minister, to complete this for our region? How many more roads are out there that have not been completed or will not find the funding that is being promised or being touted by the government? That’s our major concern.", "In lobbying for this widening and seeking support, I reached out to Joan Crozier. Joan is Bruce’s wife. I wanted to chat with her, as I always appreciate doing, just to get her sense and, really, to get her validation that I was on the right path. She certainly agreed that this was something that Bruce would want me to do and would want our community to have. I want to thank her for her acknowledgement and for her support on this.", "I also want to thank all the members of our various municipalities who, for a long time, have pushed the government to give us an answer on whether this highway was going to be completed.", "I’ve taken up 12 minutes of this debate. It shouldn’t really take more than two minutes. Are you going to give us what you promised? Are you going to deliver and finish the job you started, or are you not? It is as simple as that.", "If this government is so focused on infrastructure spending and they understand the need for infrastructure spending, then let’s go back to some of your previous promises for communities that are still lagging behind in their connectivity and the need to advance and modernize their infrastructure. That would be us. That would be Essex county.", "I would point to the fact that this has lingered for so long as being one of the measures of us having challenges throughout our economy. Allow us the opportunity to flourish. But you have to give us the appropriate tools. This is something that can easily be done. It is not a contentious issue, and it is well within the parameters and priorities and abilities of your government.", "Today’s motion simply does that. It calls on you to deliver what you promised—to finish what Bruce started. It also honours the legacy that Bruce had in our community by hopefully finishing what he started and honouring exactly his namesake, Bruce Crozier’s Way. Indeed, if Bruce Crozier was to go after his own government, he would have done it. I’m proud to carry on that legacy and to fight for our community and see Highway 3 expanded." ],

These projects are expected to create and maintain 19,500 construction jobs in this province, both directly from the road work and indirectly stemming from related projects.

They presented a very affordable and responsible business plan to the Minister of Transportation, and yet we’re still waiting, even though we’ve been told it’s a high, high priority.", "When it comes to transit, people should never have to wait dozens of years to know if they’re going to have proper access to highways. These kinds of questions play a big role in people’s lives. Knowing that they’ll be able to drive easily to work without having to wait hours in traffic is a fact that plays a big role when families get together and make decisions about where they want to move to and settle down. It means a lot for communities, and they need to know that the commitments made to them are actually coming.", "When we look at the case of Essex, the stretch of highway between Leamington and there—and quite a lot of economic development depends on promises actually coming true. There are jobs that depend on these commitments. There’s money going into communities and people going to work. It’s all part of knowing whether or not there will be reliable transportation. It’s too important to commit to doing something and then not follow through once you’re elected.", "Mr. Speaker, those are all important issues, but there’s one thing I’d like to focus on today. It’s something that should always be our focus in this House, and that’s road safety. Simply put, road safety comes second to none. Making sure that the people of this province never have to fear for their lives when they’re driving on our roads is critical. This government should always be doing what it can to promote road safety.", "I know that when it comes to Highway 3, petitions have been entered into this House before, calling on this government to complete the approved four-laning project that will keep the Windsor area safe.", "Those of you who have been reading the Auditor General’s report that came out a few short weeks ago know that road safety is a major concern. In case you missed it, the Auditor General proved that this government had been giving contracts to companies to clear our highways of snow and ice—the problem is, they awarded these contracts to the lowest bidders, companies that didn’t even have the proper equipment or enough chemicals to remove the salt. It’s easy to see what happened here: Roads became unsafe.", "Mr. Speaker, I know you’re interested in this. The companies that had been contracted to provide these services were told to report their own work—think about that—and let the ministry know if they thought they were meeting the standards. This is why it’s important; this is why it ties into Windsor. In Niagara, the contractor that won the bid refused to even report the work they had done. To this day, we have no idea if they did their job or not. Do you know why? They never reported it. The government has never asked.", "In Niagara, we knew our roads were unsafe. We contacted the MTO in the winter and they assured us that everything was fine. Our office was told, “Safety is our top priority at this ministry.” They also said, “The ministry continuously monitors the contractor’s compliance in meeting winter maintenance standards and ensures highways are safe for winter travel.”", "Well, the Auditor General’s report shows clearly that this wasn’t the case in Niagara and across the province of Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, I hope you can see what I’m trying to illustrate here and why it relates to the motion. The people in this province knew their roads were unsafe in the winter. We proved that with the winter roads report we launched when we were receiving complaints from across the province. This government received warnings over and over and over again that winter roads were not being cleared properly. In my office, we inquired directly to the minister regarding a stretch of the QEW between Sodom Road and Lyons Creek Road in Fort Erie. We were told that the government was properly monitoring this. We know this wasn’t the case. We saw dozens and dozens of accidents in my riding that could have been prevented if this government had listened to the community.", "This government knew they were receiving complaints about unsafe roads. They knew those receiving these contracts could not properly clear our roads. In fact, their own ministry officials told them that. Your own ministry officials told you that. So if this government knew our roads were unsafe, they had an obligation—as the government, you had an obligation—to fix this problem to protect the people of the province of Ontario.", "I’m going to tell you a quick story because I think my time is just about up.", "My mind goes to a GM employee driving to work on the QEW in my riding who lost control of his vehicle, crossed the highway—if anyone’s been in Niagara, the highway goes like this, side by side—on a slippery road. Do you know what happened there? It took his life. I believe, and the community believes, that if we made sure our roads were safe, that accident would never have happened.", "Mr. Speaker, I thank you for my time. I fully support the motion." ],

For that alone, I think that’s a very good thing.", "I remember back to my days in municipal government when one of the hottest topics, especially around budget time, was about reconstruction of city roads. If you wanted to get a group of citizens into your budget meeting who were hot under the collar, it was to change priorities to discover that another road in another part of the town was, in fact, in far worse shape than you had anticipated and that your plans, whatever they may have been, to construct a new road or reconstruct an existing road would have to be bumped back in order to accommodate higher-priority roads. I know that sometimes is hard to swallow but, in municipal life and in provincial life, that is the way things are.", "I just wanted to touch on a couple of things to carry on. In the 2014-15 budget, we committed to spending almost $2 billion to expand and repair southern Ontario highways and bridges. It’s estimated that that $1.95 billion of investments will create 19,500 jobs in southern Ontario. This is part of the southern highways program.", "I’m proud to say this: Ontario roads are among the safest in North America. In fact, I’ve read that in the previous years we were either number one or number two for having the safest roads in North America. I think that demonstrates the commitment that the workers—our staff, our employees—place on making sure that our roads are among the best and among the safest.", "I know that the government has been investing to keep Ontario’s highways and bridges in good repair to reduce congestion, improve safety and promote the economy. The Highway 404 extension north of my riding was on the books for years and years and years. Finally, after probably about 20 years, it was opened this year. It’s a good thing because it’s taking about 20,000 cars off the road each day. But it took a long time for it to be built, primarily because there were other priorities where roads and bridges were crumbling and in great need of repair. We’re also continuing with key expansion projects such as the Rt. Hon. Herb Gray Parkway and Highway 407 East.", "As I said, our government is focusing resources where they’re needed the most: the rehabilitation of Ontario’s pavement and bridges. When I did a little research about this particular road, it seems to me that it has not been forgotten. It is on the books, and currently the government is undertaking a study to update the 2006 design recommendations. So it has not been forgotten, in my books.", "The ministry is investing nearly an additional $50 million to widen 13 kilometres of Highway 3; that’s phase 1 and 2. The one that leapt out at me, when I was reading through some of the literature, was that work to widen the remaining two-lane section of Highway 3 between Leamington and Windsor is still listed in the southern highways program under planning for the future. In the meantime, the government is reconstructing Highway 3 and those reconstructed lanes won’t be torn up. It’s not a waste of money. Those reconstructed lanes will become the future westbound lanes of the four-lane highway. That’s where I’ll leave it for now." ],

He has talked about the history of this issue and the fact that apparently a campaign promise was made by the government in 2006 to finish this work by 2014-15 and it’s still not done.", "I have an opportunity occasionally to visit the Windsor and Essex area, and to drive the roads, of course. I am very well acquainted. In fact, the former member for Essex, Bruce Crozier, was a very good friend of mine because we served together as presiding officers, and I came to know he and Joan very well. I was very, very pleased when it was decided that Highway 3 would be named to remember and honour Bruce Crozier. It was very fitting and appropriate that that was done.", "I certainly want to, again, comment about what a great man Bruce Crozier was and what an outstanding member of provincial Parliament. It would be inappropriate for me to purport to know what he would say on this issue, but I certainly know of his commitment to his constituency. He was certainly willing to speak up on behalf of his riding, if need be, challenging the powers that be in his own party. Obviously, he was that sort of a member and in that way he was an example, I think, to all members. The member for Essex is certainly bringing forward an idea that needs to be brought forward.", "Coincidentally, I actually have a private member’s resolution that is before the House too, as future business. It was actually the very first one on the order paper that was tabled on July 3, 2014, the very first day it was possible to table a private member’s resolution. I think we had the throne speech that day, if I’m not mistaken. I call upon the government to put the Highway 6 Morriston bypass project on the southern highways program, the ministry’s five-year investment plan for new highway construction in southern Ontario.", "Obviously, I want to support the member for Essex in this regard. I’m not suggesting that I’m going to support his resolution and ask him to support mine, but clearly he’s doing the same sort of thing I was trying to do, which is to bring this forward in the Legislature and encourage the government to give consideration, but also to highlight the importance of the project.", "Now, we’ve heard from government members in the context of this debate that the government plans to spend $2 billion on the southern highways program. That’s a big number; there’s no question. But, of course, it leads us, as opposition members, to say, “Okay, where are our projects in that $2 billion?” I think it’s a legitimate question.", "The government obviously has all kinds of various projects before it, but we, as opposition members, have an obligation to bring forward these particular projects and try to raise awareness about the need, and try to get the government to listen, pay attention and hopefully respond.", "The very day after the election, June 13 last year, I went to work in my riding office. The first thing I did was write a letter to the Premier, and I said this to her: “As you know from your tenure as Minister of Transportation, Highway 6 serves as a vital link between the 401 and the Hamilton/Niagara region and the US border. However, drivers travelling this route encounter a severe bottleneck in the community of Morriston, in Puslinch township, just south of the 401. Oftentimes traffic is backed up for kilometres in both directions.", "“By constructing the Highway 6 Morriston bypass, this bottleneck would be eliminated, and traffic and goods could flow back and forth from Hamilton to the 401 more” easily and “quickly and safely. There would also be a” huge “positive economic benefit for a large region of the province. There is huge economic cost related to the current congestion at Morriston.", "“As you know, I’ve been raising this in the Legislature for many years.", "“Working with the township of Puslinch and the county of Wellington, I have repeatedly written and spoken to successive Ministers of Transportation urging that the Highway 6 Morriston bypass project be placed on the Ministry of Transportation’s southern highways program, MTO’s five-year plan for new highway construction. I have also raised the issue many times in speeches in the Legislature.”", "In fact, we had an important meeting with the former Minister of the Environment, John Gerretsen, a few years ago, where we pushed him to ensure that the environmental assessment could be concluded on this project. That was part of the work we did some time ago, and I would draw to the minister’s attention again that the Morriston bypass environmental assessment has been concluded. Obviously, it’s been a few years now, but we’ve got to keep momentum going forward.", "I continued my letter to the Premier in this way: “During the most recent provincial Parliament, after you became the Premier, I introduced a private member’s resolution again calling on the Minister of Transportation to put the Highway 6 Morriston bypass on the ministry’s five-year plan for highway construction. My resolution,” even then, “was the very first item on the order paper, as I tabled it the same day as your government’s throne speech on February 19, 2013.", "“This project has been talked about for a generation. It is time for this project to proceed.", "“Once more, I urge you to prioritize this project and ensure that it is placed on the Ministry of Transportation’s five-year plan for highway construction.”", "Of course, we were called back into session in July, Mr. Speaker, as you know, right after the election. I again tabled this private member’s resolution, and it is, indeed, the first item on the Legislature’s order paper.", "On October 6, a group had been formed, called the Morriston Bypass Coalition. They met with many ministry staff, including staff of the Premier, and made a number of recommendations.", "I’m unfortunately running out of time.", "I have asked the current Minister of Transportation to meet again with the township of Puslinch and the Morriston Bypass Coalition.

I can remember in 1999, just before a provincial election, standing on Canadian Tire property at the corner of the 406 and Main Street in Welland. Tony Clement was the member then. I was there with our dearly departed friend Peter Kormos. Tony Clement promised my community that the 406 extension, the double-widening, would happen if Frank Sheehan was elected: “If you elect Frank, this is going to happen in the next couple of years.” Well, that was in 1999; it is now 2015.

We hear every day in this Legislature about the gridlock in Toronto and the loss to the economy here in the city of Toronto, but our communities—our rural communities and our small communities in the north, the south, the east and in the west—all have those same challenges. They can’t attract new business and they can’t attract more population growth if they do not have the tools, the roads and the hydro that they’re looking for as well in Essex.", "I think that when governments actually take on a project and they make municipalities do five- and 10-year plans, they should actually meet those commitments.

Their parents recognize the proven science which underscores the medical evidence that immunization works. It not only protects children from disease but also those around them.", "But in recent years, we have seen a troubling new trend. With families opting out of vaccinations here in Ontario, those children are not only at risk of harmful and sometimes deadly diseases, but they are also putting other children at risk at school and in the community.", "There are children who are not able to participate in our immunization program due to medical reasons. It’s our responsibility as parents to ensure that we are protecting these children by vaccinating our own children.", "In our province, for over a century, dedicated researchers and health care professionals have worked tirelessly to reduce and eliminate a long list of infectious diseases which at one time ravaged our population: cholera, smallpox, tuberculosis, diphtheria, typhus, polio, tetanus, whooping cough, rubella, meningitis and measles. If you ask your grandparents or your great-grandparents, if they’re still alive, they’ll tell you what it was like when there was an outbreak of one of these debilitating diseases in their community.", "Polio, for example, left many children paralyzed. At its height in 1953, polio caused about 500 deaths in Canada, while disabling thousands more. But two years later, when a polio vaccine was introduced, the incident rate dropped dramatically. By the mid-1990s, Canada and all of the Americas were certificated as polio-free, and today around the globe, polio has been virtually eliminated.", "Another contagious disease that has afflicted millions of people around the planet is measles. Also known as rubella or red measles, this disease is a highly contagious virus. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough and a blotchy rash. It’s easily spread from person to person through direct contact or through the air from sneezing or coughing. A severe case can bring on brain swelling, pneumonia and hearing loss. The World Health Organization has stated that measles is the leading global cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in children under five.", "Before a vaccine was introduced in Canada in the early 1960s, we averaged about 400,000 cases of measles every year. By the mid-1990s, that number had dropped dramatically, to just over 2,000. Immunization is truly one of the most significant advancements in public health in this country and has saved more lives than any other health measure.", "So considering the benefits to the health and well-being of all Canadians, why do we now see the emergence of skepticism questioning the efficacy of immunization? We’ve heard the fear mongering expressed by those who are opposed to vaccinations. Some claim that the vaccines contain dangerous chemicals. Others believe that they can combat potentially deadly diseases using so-called alternative treatments.", "If you enter “anti-vaccination” on an Internet search, you will find a Wild West of fear mongering and conspiracy theories.

The study, which appeared in the medical journal The Lancet, set off a firestorm of controversy but was later debunked as being fraudulent and misleading. In fact, 10 of the 13 authors of that paper later said that they should not have published it. The Lancet even discredited the claim that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism spectrum disorder.", "But the damage was done. There are parents today who honestly believe that they’re making the right choice for their children by saying no to vaccinations. Sadly, they are putting their children and others at great risk.", "We saw this recently as measles flared up in parts of Ontario. The first cases appeared in Toronto and were soon followed by several reported cases in the Niagara area. Starting on February 2 of this year, there were four confirmed cases of measles in Toronto, and that number across Canada surged to 137. There were a total of nine cases in Toronto, six in the Niagara region and one in both Peel and Halton regions. But the worst-hit region was the Lanaudière area of Quebec, where there were 119 confirmed cases of measles, and that truly is a troubling figure.", "Coming into contact with this virus can be devastating, not only for those who contract the virus but also for everyone in the household and those who come into contact with them.", "A troubling example of this is the case of a young family in York region. A mother of two small children was called by York Region Public Health on February 9 after visiting her doctor’s office in Markham. She was told that a patient who had visited the same office had been diagnosed with measles. Now, her baby, not old enough to be vaccinated, and her toddler, only having received one dose of the two-dose vaccine, were forced to stay at home for the 21-day incubation period.", "These vaccine-preventable diseases are incredibly contagious and especially dangerous, as many do not show signs or symptoms of infection for anywhere between seven and 21 days. It’s for this reason that we do need to protect the most vulnerable who are unable to protect themselves, especially where these diseases are being spread by unsuspecting carriers in public places.", "In Ontario, we do have a very strict protocol for the vaccination of children. Legally, if you attend school in this province, you must be vaccinated. The Immunization of School Pupils Act, the ISPA, requires that parents of children attending primary or secondary school provide their local medical officer of health with proof that their child had their immunization against the designated diseases, but exemptions are allowed on the basis of a parent’s religious or philosophical beliefs. Only about 2% of Ontario students, on average, are opting for this exemption.", "Immunization authorities tell us that an estimated 95% vaccine coverage is needed to stop the spread of a virus. This is referred to as “herd immunity.” It is true not just for measles but for all vaccine-preventable illnesses. So some parents may think that their kids are safe from these illnesses because their classmates are vaccinated, but if too many parents are of this mindset, we’re going to see lower vaccination rates in our classrooms, putting all students at risk, putting younger siblings at risk, and putting the general public at risk when they leave the classroom.", "Mr. Speaker, you may have heard of the recent outbreak of mumps in the NHL this past winter. Nine players were affected from the New York Rangers, the Minnesota Wild, and the Anaheim Ducks. They missed up to eight games each. Now, team doctors were quick to act and gave the players booster shots, stopping the spread of the virus.", "The importance of vaccinating is simply unquestionable. Preventing illness is not only good for our public health; it’s also the best option for our public purse. Preventing illnesses with vaccines keeps Ontarians out of emergency rooms and doctors’ offices, leaving space open for patients who do need critical care, preventing the spread of the virus, and leaving funds available for other important services within our health care system.", "Vaccines have saved more lives in the last 50 years than any other health intervention program in Canada. I’m proud of this government for having such a strong immunization strategy.", "In Ontario, the provincial government currently funds 22 vaccines, providing protection against 16 different illnesses. Publicly funded vaccines are provided through many different programs. There’s the infant and childhood immunizations, school-based immunizations, adult immunizations, the Universal Influenza Immunization Program, and high-risk immunization programs. The research is currently under way for new vaccines, and we all need to be concerned about this.", "Health organizations in Ontario do work very closely with Health Canada studying newly approved vaccines, always looking for new, innovative ways to keep Ontarians healthy and at their very best.", "Mr. Speaker, you might have heard the recent good news of the very special gift that Canada has offered to the newly born Princess Charlotte, the latest addition to the royal family. In her name, our federal government is making a charitable donation of $100,000 to Immunize Canada. This is an organization that promotes the safe use of vaccines across our nation. The funds are going to be used to educate the public on the benefits of vaccinating. We know that having access to life-saving vaccines will ensure that children coast to coast will have the best start at life.", "Mr. Speaker, while I was preparing to present this motion to you and to the House today, I was reminded of what I saw on a number of occasions while producing television documentaries from parts of sub-Saharan Africa. I saw mothers and fathers lined up for hours seeking basic health care for their children. I saw young people afflicted with diseases which are easily preventable in this country because of our access to vaccines.

The history is clear. Immunization saves lives, and we are so fortunate in this province to have fully funded access to vaccinations. So I encourage my colleagues from all sides of the House to support this motion to protect all Ontarians from vaccine-preventable illnesses." ],

The first are those who have, for whatever reasons, unfounded hesitation about using vaccinations. As I think has already been pointed out and certainly will continue to be pointed out, this is a group that are not only a risk for themselves, but they are also a huge risk for the second group of people. This is, fortunately, a small group of people who cannot accept inoculation; for whatever medical reason, they can’t. The third group is the almost 99% of the population that should and does immunize their children. The reason for that importance is for that second group I mentioned. They need to be in the presence of the vast majority of people having received inoculation, because they have no ability to protect themselves.", "I would say today that what we should conclude with is the important role of education and information that must go out to those people who for unfounded hesitation have not had their children vaccinated." ],

I saw first-hand the need for education and awareness around immunizations. Only in the last few months we’ve seen a resurgence of measles. In my own area of Niagara, they had to open immunization clinics actually, and six children were diagnosed with measles most recently. Back in the early 2000s, we saw the outbreak of SARS, which took the lives of many health care workers and many Ontarians over a period of a number of months. Then in 2011 in the Niagara region, we saw an outbreak of C. difficile where I think as many as 16 patients were affected. Some of that could have been avoided because some of it was due to cuts in budgets around housekeeping and disinfecting in hospitals.", "But to go back to the bill, infection spreads very easily, very readily. So I think that it’s important that not only Ontarians, not only the people who are responsible for making sure their kids get the vaccinations, but also physicians, health care workers and public health departments do a great job of trying to educate parents about the importance of vaccinations and making sure they’re kept up to date, that they’re medically necessary, except in those few cases when it is medically—" ],

There’s been this whole discussion in the last couple of years about vaccinations and autism, although there isn’t any medical evidence, I think, to totally support that at this point. There can be complications from these contagious communicable diseases, like measles, that can be much more problematic than the actual disease itself, things like encephalitis, inner ear infections and pneumonia that people can actually get when they’re not vaccinated.", "The bill is encouraging legislators to encourage parents, but I don’t really know that it’s our job to do that. It’s the job of the health care workers. It’s the job of physicians. It’s the job of our community health centres, our family health teams and our public health units. I think the job of the government is to make sure that those particular agencies are appropriately funded so that they’re not having to constantly cut back their resources. If you have enough people working in those particular agencies to actually educate and bring awareness to the issues and the importance of vaccination, I think that is more important than actually asking legislators to encourage parents to do this.", "I know that this government has certainly had a failed strategy around immunization over the last short while. In 2014, the Auditor General actually reported that when she reviewed the immunization strategy, she clearly stated the government was failing to protect Ontarians, and she was distressed to know that 20% of Ontario’s flu vaccine goes missing each year. That’s a lot of money. That’s a lot of money going somewhere. We’re buying these vaccines—sometimes it’s problematic to even try to get them in a timely way. Then they go missing and the government can’t find out—they have no tracking system to find out where those hundreds of thousands of dollars in vaccines disappeared to.", "There were 21,000 instances alone last year when the minister paid physicians and pharmacists to administer the flu vaccine more than once to the same patient. I hope the government has actually gone back and retrieved those overpayments from druggists and physicians.", "I find it strange that, in this modern day, the government still doesn’t have an appropriate tracking system for immunization in the province. The federal government as well, their leadership is lacking too, because they need to create a national database.", "Already the new Panorama database has doubled its original budget—another example of poor public policy by the government. It’s like another SAMS debacle, except now it’s with the immunization program. The government spent $142 million to better track vaccinations and children who have not had their vaccinations, but it’s still not working. Local health officials have reported that there are so many problems in that current database system that they can no longer warn or suspend those who put their classmates at risk. Thousands of records were accidentally duplicated across health units in the province, making officials unable to know who was immunized and who wasn’t immunized. They’ve wasted so much time sorting out those duplications that children in kindergarten and grade 1 haven’t even been added to the new system. If we see an outbreak of measles in a classroom, health officials will be unable to isolate vaccinated or non-vaccinated kids.", "The new system also doesn’t permit any temporary exemptions for parents who need time to find their missing records. This means that parents won’t get a reminder from the system for their child when they need a booster shot.", "Once again, although the intent of this private member’s bill is good, we are reminded of the importance of accountability and transparency around public policy. We’re also reminded of the waste of public tax dollars when systems don’t work. I hope that this debate gives some momentum to improve the immunization strategy as we raise these problems for you today.", "Certainly, New Democrats support having every person immunized who is medically able to be. But we also support appropriate funding and not freezing of budgets for public health units, community health centres, hospitals and family health teams, because when you freeze those budgets, you end up actually cutting their budgets. They have to cut somewhere.

As kids, we would all walk together, and we often tried to keep pace with her, but as kids, we would often skip ahead of her. I can still remember, in the image of my mind even now, the three of us way ahead and she walking slowly, limping, coming up at the rear. At the time, we didn’t think much of it, but now that I’m much older, I try to think of how hard it must have been for her to be always catching up. I have no recollection at all of her ever complaining.", "What’s really telling is, this was not in the 1950s, as Daiene was talking about polio in Canada. This was in the 1980s. As late as 1988, in India, there were annually 200,000 cases of polio.", "But what’s really remarkable is that in 2011, against all odds, India finally became polio-free, because for three years, in a population of 1.2 billion people, there was not a single case of polio. That is considered one of the biggest, biggest triumphs of public health and modern medicine, and that is the true story of vaccinations.", "But here sometimes, I think we become a victim of our own success, because we have forgotten the lives that vaccinations save.

So I think there’s a little bit of complacency as—you know, this debate around whether we should vaccinate or not.", "When you look around the world; when you’ve grown up like I have, with a friend who had polio—and I know many people, depending on your demographics, even in Canada, may have remembered friends who had polio—you really begin to realize the value of these vaccinations and the tragic consequences of not vaccinating.", "That was brought home to me by an article I read in CNN that talked about this young five-year-old girl in India who became the last person to contract polio. Her story is a story of parents who had vaccinated their three other kids but for some reason didn’t vaccinate this child. They live with that regret, that this child is the poster child, the one who became the last person in a population of 1.2 billion to contract polio.", "I think we need to bring these stories to life to remind people that we cannot take these gains for granted and that it’s really important that all of us who can and are medically able to should get vaccinated, for ourselves and the greater good of society." ],

We’re hearing stories of parents who had embarked on a program of vaccination for their children, because they had been convinced, but they hadn’t yet been able to complete—because we know you can’t suddenly give all the vaccinations at one time—and their children contracted measles or rubella.", "It is heartbreaking when we think about medical professionals, people who graduated medical school, who had to retract their studies. They did fraudulent studies which convinced many in the communities—parents, and celebrities, unfortunately—to jump on the bandwagon to convince parents that there’s a connection between autism and vaccines. My husband will always say, “Well that’s an association, not a causation.” He’s a physician. His favourite example is that people who have Jacuzzis have more heart attacks. It doesn’t mean that if you get rid of your Jacuzzi, you’re going to have a lower incidence of heart attack. It just means that there is an association between Jacuzzis and maybe a sedentary lifestyle, a more affluent, going-to-restaurants-more-often lifestyle. It is not a cause of the heart attacks.", "I think that it’s our job here as legislators to serve the people who elected us, who put us here, and to explain the science. Not to focus on the political science, not to just create legislation to force people to do things, but to have people understand the science behind vaccination, to understand that it’s about being part of a community and doing what’s helpful to your community. There are people, we’ve heard, who are in the community who cannot be vaccinated, and it means that everybody who can be vaccinated must be vaccinated. We can all do better.", "I remember when the chickenpox vaccine came out because that was in my time as a parent.

In it, he spoke of his concerns regarding the “anti-vaccination movement,” which he characterized as misguided. He went on to say, “It makes me sad, mad and frightened to see whooping cough and measles cases.” In a conversation we had recently, he reminded me how terror-stricken parents were in the 1950s because of polio. They wouldn’t let their children swim in public pools and they avoided public places until a vaccine was developed. Only then did they breathe a sigh of a relief.", "He noted a more recent case and situation in the Russian Federation in 1990 where, in order to save money, the government stopped vaccinating for diphtheria, thinking the danger was over. Sadly, close to 157,000 cases were reported throughout the region, with close to 5,000 deaths—which is absolutely remarkable for such a preventable cause—until control measures were brought to bear.", "Dr. Ford-Jones also underscored the important public health benefits of vaccination from the perspective of vaccinating one’s own children. Some children, he noted, are hard to protect: Those on steroids, those who have suppressed immune systems, transplant recipients, those with irradiated blood diseases and leukemics. All are susceptible, as they cannot be vaccinated. These examples highlight the importance we all play in ensuring public safety and the health and well-being of one’s own children as well as others.", "In short, there is significant scientific proof to show that vaccinations are one of the most effective means of preventing the spread of infectious diseases in our population.

We recently enhanced our Immunization of School Pupils Act, which aims to help protect our children from many serious diseases that can easily be spread in schools by ensuring their vaccinations are up to date. I would encourage all Ontarians to check and make sure that their own immunizations are up to date as well.", "Despite the overwhelming support from the medical community and myriads of studies that show the effectiveness of vaccinations, there are individuals and groups out there that believe that getting a needle is bad for you and can cause all kinds of long-term effects. The reality is that there is no convincing evidence that vaccines are in any way harmful to your health. Virtually every study that has shown negative long-term effects from vaccines has failed to stand up to the peer review process and has been debunked entirely.", "It would be irresponsible for us to risk the health of our communities over misplaced fears and bad science.

If they’re not vaccinated and there is no medical reason for them not to be vaccinated, these young ladies felt that they shouldn’t be allowed in school, because they were going to impact and hurt their fellow classmates.

Now this is a little bit bizarre to explain, but vaccinations are offered at a particular age. They don’t cause problems, but because they happen at the sort of same time as other conditions may develop—for example, autism and so on—people think that there’s an association with it or a causality, but that’s not true. For example, let’s say people thought of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, which is given to children at age 4 or 5, “Oh, that causes you to go to kindergarten.” It doesn’t cause you to go to kindergarten; it just happens to happen at approximately the same time. So that’s an association, not a causality.", "This is where I think we need to educate our peers and Ontarians about the science of what is actually going on.

I think it’s troubling that we have taken for granted the impact that vaccines have had on our society, which is leaving some people with the false comfort that their children can go unvaccinated.", "We know that there is an association between this growing trend of people refusing vaccines and the growing spread of disease. Ontario had 18 cases of measles between December 2014 and March 2015, an outbreak that began in December at Disneyland. While public health officials are now confident that our province is measles-free, I think we still need to do better to protect the young, the old, the vulnerable and everyone in between.

  "text" : [ "It is a pleasure for me to rise today to join the debate on Bill 7, the Promoting Affordable Housing Act. This morning, with the time that I have available to me, I wanted to give an overview of some of the provisions in this bill that we see as most significant. I want to talk about some of the gaps in this bill and some of the concerns that we have on this side of the House about this legislation and point out how it could be strengthened as we move through the legislative process and, as I expect, into committee.", "Also, I wanted to give you some context of the need for this bill, based on the reality that people in my community are experiencing when they struggle to find affordable housing in London. Of course, that is an experience that is shared by many, many people across this province, given the crisis in affordable housing that we have had not just in the last decade but for several decades now.", "So I first wanted to highlight seven of the key provisions of the bill that I’m going to focus some time on. The first provision, of course, is the Planning Act amendments that will allow municipalities to introduce inclusionary zoning policies and bylaws. This is something that my colleague the member for Parkdale–High Park has pushed for relentlessly. She introduced five private members’ bills on inclusionary zoning. She has been a remarkable advocate and champion for this kind of policy change because she knows that the evidence is there to support its effectiveness in increasing the stock of affordable housing. That’s why my community, the city of London, has also long been a supporter of inclusionary zoning and has wanted to have that ability within the Planning Act to enact policies and bylaws that would allow inclusionary zoning to go ahead. That’s the first provision I wanted to talk about.", "The second provision is around the amendments to the Development Charges Act that will prevent municipalities from levying development charges for second units. Again, in my community, we have just gone through this debate about granny flats. There had been a concern about residences that had introduced granny flats, and there was a lot of opinion on both sides of the issue about whether granny flats and these kinds of secondary units were a good planning tool—whether this is the way that we want to build our community.", "I have talked in this House before about the significant public engagement process that we went through in London that resulted in our new official plan. That new official plan recognizes, front and centre, that we need to build up. So granny flats and secondary units are important tools to enable that kind of development that we want to see in our cities and in my community of London.", "The third provision I wanted to highlight was the amendment to the Housing Services Act that will change the process that is used to transfer or sell social housing projects. Currently, until this legislation is passed, service managers—that is, the municipality’s or the district’s—were required to get approval from the minister if they wanted to merge, dissolve or sell their social housing agencies. With the amendments that are proposed in this act, they will no longer have to go through that process. They will no longer need ministerial approval if they want to dispose of their social housing projects.", "You can certainly imagine, Speaker, that this may raise some red flags about social housing stock that has become burdensome for the municipality. They want to try to remove this deteriorating stock from their assets and they may decide to sell or transfer, and they’ll be able to do that without requiring approval from the ministry.", "Now this, in some situations, could be very much a good thing, but in other situations it could compromise the number of affordable housing units that would be available within a jurisdiction.", "The fourth provision I wanted to focus on is about the introduction of portable housing benefits. Certainly we have heard repeated calls from municipalities across the province—certainly in my own city of London—for more flexibility. Portable housing benefits do provide a measure of flexibility in terms of providing financial assistance to people so that they can move to other affordable housing units. Our concern, the caveat to this, the flip side to this, is that these portable housing benefits, by providing cash to people, may not in the end do anything to provide more affordable housing or to ensure that someone is able to become securely housed.", "The fifth provision I wanted to highlight is around the amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act. Whereas previously the minister was responsible for receiving complaints about inadequate maintenance in rental units where there were no municipal standards, now all municipalities will be required to receive complaints and to send in inspectors to investigate the level of maintenance, or the lack of maintenance, in buildings.", "The sixth provision is also around the Residential Tenancies Act amendments that ensure that tenants who no longer qualify for rent-geared-to-income assistance after they have paid market rent for a period of 12 months no longer will risk eviction because of this. Those of us who have had constituents who are in this circumstance, when they have been living in their home for years and years and years—this is their home. They have made it their home. They have all kinds of happy memories. They have invested in improvements in their home. When they find out that they are going to be evicted after they paid market rent for 12 months, it can be devastating.", "I had a constituent in my office who was in tears because of a similar situation. She was being asked to leave an apartment where she had raised her family. This was her home, and her home was being taken away from her because of legislation that we had in place.", "Finally, the other provision that I wanted to highlight was around the new requirement that municipal service managers enumerate homeless persons within their area. I don’t question that this would provide useful data. There wasn’t a lot of information in the bill about how this enumeration is to take place, and, especially, there were no references in the bill as to resources provided to municipal service managers to conduct this enumeration. So there are still lots of questions about that aspect of the bill.", "I wanted to talk a little bit about what’s going on in my community. Of course, all of us in this House, when we review legislation, when we speak to bills that are before us, we think of it in terms of the people that we represent: Will this legislation actually assist the people that we represent? What are the gaps in the legislation? What are some of the changes that would be needed to actually help us advance the interests of our communities and of our constituencies?", "In the city of London, there has been a formal embrace of a Housing First approach to dealing with homelessness and affordable housing in our community. The Homeless Prevention and Housing Plan was formalized a couple of years ago. It sets out a multi-year plan, from 2010 to 2024, to address London’s homelessness and affordable housing needs. That plan states right up front that the solution to prevent and end homelessness is housing with supports.", "Once people are securely housed, once they have stability in terms of where they live, then they will be able to move on and deal with the complex challenges that many people deal with around addictions, mental illness, trauma, family violence, childhood sexual abuse—and the list goes on and on of the kinds of issues that people have to deal with. Of course, to achieve that level of housing security to enable people to deal with these other issues, we must ensure that there are affordable housing options available to house these people.", "In London, we are perhaps a little bit better off than some other communities in terms of our housing affordability. Our rents are lower than the city of Toronto; that is true. Nevertheless, we do face a significant shortage of affordable rental housing.", "There are just over 8,000 units of social housing within the city of London, and almost 6,000 of them offer rent-geared-to-income rents. So we do have that stock of affordable housing, those 8,000 units. They are important, but they are stretched to the limit, frankly, in terms of the level of need that we see in the community.", "Just over the last couple of weeks, the London Free Press has been running an amazing series of articles about poverty in London. They have drawn on the work that was done by the mayor’s task force on poverty, which culminated in a very impressive document called London for All: A Roadmap to End Poverty. That report gave some statistics about the levels of poverty we are facing in the London area. We have 62,000 Londoners living in poverty. Of those, more than 35,000 people live in extreme poverty, what researchers have called brutal poverty. The headline in the paper on the weekend: “‘Brutal’ Poverty Plagues London Like Few Other Cities Across Our Region.” So we have 62,000 Londoners living in poverty. We have 35,000 people in London who are living in the most dire poverty.", "We also have 11,000 Londoners who are considered the working poor. Their income is below the low-income measure but they are working. That figure in London, the 5% of our population that is considered working poor, is the second highest in Ontario.", "Our challenges are great in London. We need affordable housing. It’s the fundamental strategy to enable us to move forward and start addressing these challenges.", "You’ll recall I started off by saying that we have 8,000 units of social housing, with 6,000 of these offering rent-geared-to-income. As you can imagine, and I’m sure it will be no surprise, there are significant wait-lists to access the available housing that we have in my community. In December 2014, according to the most recent data from the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association, we had about 2,800 households that were waiting for access to rent-geared-to-income housing. On that list, the largest single category of households that were waiting was single adults and couples. We had 1,540 single adults and couples on the wait-list. We had over 1,000 families on the wait-list, and we had 265 seniors on the wait-list. So there is a real need to move this file forward and to get more affordable housing built in the province.", "Bill 7, the Liberal government’s approach to dealing with this challenge, is a start, but one of our biggest concerns with this legislation is that so much of it is left to regulation. There are big statements and big policy approaches; however, the nitty-gritty of the legislation—how it will actually work and what it will actually change—depends on the regulations that are yet to come and that we won’t have an opportunity to debate in this Legislature. So whether Bill 7 turns out to be the solution that we have been pushing for is a big question mark. We don’t know until we see what those regulations look like.", "I had mentioned before some of the concerns about the ability of municipalities to sell or transfer their social housing stock without ministerial approval, and also the introduction of the portable housing benefits. Yes, there is a need for greater flexibility, both for municipalities and for those who are looking for affordable housing, but privatizing our social housing stock is not the solution. That would be a very negative consequence if that is what happens as a result of this legislation.", "On the issue of portable housing benefits, I think we really have to ask the question: What happens when the cash flows right from the person receiving it to the landlord, when it’s just used as a reason for landlords to increase rent and there is no real benefit to the person who’s receiving that portable housing benefit?", "In the final time I have remaining, I wanted to talk about two of the most significant gaps in this legislation that my colleagues and I in the NDP will be raising repeatedly. First, there is nothing in this legislation to bring back rent control to address the two-tiered issue that we have right now, where buildings that were built prior to 1991 have rent control but all of those new builds since 1991 are not subject to any kind of rent control provisions. This is a huge gap. It’s a huge barrier to creating affordable housing that will benefit communities across the province and my constituents in London.", "Speaker, as I said, we are supportive of this legislation. It is a start. It’s something we’ve called for for a long time. We’re glad that the work of my colleague the member for Parkdale–High Park has been acknowledged in the inclusionary zoning provisions, but you can be assured that we will have a lot of ideas for amendments that can improve and strengthen this bill, that can help ensure that this bill actually addresses those dire needs of people who are struggling, who are on social assistance, who are in that working poor category who can hardly afford to put a roof over their heads." ],

They’re in huge houses—2,000 to 3,000 square feet—and they may have the potential to rent out part of their house.", "For many years, there was so much NIMBYism. I remember that the bylaw officers were constantly called in, when I was on city council, to essentially threaten people with almost the death penalty if they didn’t get rid of their basement apartment or the second suite upstairs. All they were trying to do was provide housing, make a little bit of money if they were on a fixed income or were retired seniors and give people a place to start in housing. So I’m glad to see London is looking at that.", "One of the problems is that many municipalities are not doing it. Even that small option which helps they’re not even doing, and they’re making it difficult for people to incorporate secondary suites by putting all kind of roadblocks in their way. I’m glad the city of London came to the conclusion that they’re going to allow them, it seems.", "I thank the member for her very thoughtful and very clear explanation of what’s in this legislation.

  "text" : [ "I just want to continue in the same vein as the member opposite, which is that he was talking about secondary suites and what an effective tool they can be to provide affordable housing in many of our communities.", "There are a few issues with secondary suites that I think make the voters a little bit jumpy. One is that they are concerned about parking. For a lot of secondary suite residents, unfortunately, the transit isn’t viable in the communities where they’re living, and they’re still purchasing cars. Even newly arrived Canadians, one of the first things we hear of them doing, and it’s very unfortunate, is to go out and purchase a used car. So parking becomes a major issue and a major headache in many of the communities where people only have on-street parking or very little parking. People go and pave over their front lawns to provide parking for these new tenants and then are told to take out the parking. It’s a serious concern.", "But the reality is that there are lots of secondary suites that are not following the rules and regulations. They may not be providing the proper safety: electrical safety, water safety, sprinkler systems, exits in terms of fire. A lot of times with secondary suites, we know when we go out campaigning that we can catch that there are other tenants in the house, but they’re kind of hiding from us because they feel they’re not supposed to be there. They’re not registered to vote, and I think they don’t have a voice if they don’t vote. I fully support everybody in the community who could vote being able to vote and being registered to vote, but I also recognize that those who are in secondary suites have to pay the taxes in their community that provide them the services, the garbage collection.", "I think the main concern is those bad tenants that people hear about. I think there are a lot of people who would put in a secondary suite if it was zoned in their area but they don’t when they read all the articles about bad tenants." ],

I’d like to make comments on the distinguished member from London West, but first let me say, being from Windsor, my hometown team is the Detroit Tigers, but today let me say: Go, Jays! Go, Jays!", "The member for London West talked about our colleague from Parkdale–High Park, who introduced inclusionary zoning by way of private member’s bills five times. The member for Etobicoke–Lakeshore has introduced a private member’s bill on inclusionary zoning. We’ve heard from various people that if inclusionary zoning had been brought in 10 years ago, when it was first introduced in this Legislature as a private member’s bill, we would have—on the 10% formula of buildings over 50 units—something like 100,000 affordable housing units built in Toronto alone in the past 10 years, which would really cut into the wait-list.", "I read this morning, I think it was on Homeless Hub, that the wait-list now in Toronto—it used to be 76,000. It’s now 85,000 people on a wait-list for subsidized housing just in the city of Toronto, let alone across the province. My understanding is, Speaker, that over 175,000 people, families, are on a wait-list for affordable housing.", "So this bill could have done a whole bunch more moving us along in this direction, because there is a poison pill in this bill when it comes to inclusionary zoning, and that makes it an either/or provision. If your municipality uses section 37, cash in lieu of parking, parkland or whatever, you can’t take cash-in-lieu benefits, section 37, if you bring in inclusionary zoning." ],

But a bit of what she was saying causes me some concern, and it’s this notion that privatization cannot be part of the solution. There’s a myopic sense in that party that the only affordable housing that can exist has to be in public control. That’s just not the case." ],

But I don’t think that was reflected in the member from London West’s remarks, where she identified 8,000 affordable housing units in London. I can assure you that there are a lot more affordable housing units in London. They’re just not the ones that are in private control; they’re not the ones that are in public housing control, 6,000 of which are rent-geared-to-income. Because the whole purpose of inclusionary zoning, as was noted by the member from Windsor–Tecumseh, is that you do have an opportunity for secondary suites.", "She also talked about rent control being a gaping hole in this legislation. Let’s not kid ourselves. The rent controls that were brought in by the previous NDP government under Bob Rae decimated the affordable housing market in Toronto and other communities in Ontario because it didn’t allow the private sector to continue to build. They wouldn’t; the returns weren’t there. And they weren’t able to keep upkeep. So the housing stock went into a dismal state of repair, which is why it had to be reversed, as it was. Rent controls continue on the previous suites and don’t exist now. I would resist, tremendously, any amendment to this legislation which would bring back rent control." ],

That is a concern because it will allow municipalities to continue dragging their heels in moving this forward, on which the member is absolutely right: This is an important tool to help increase the stock of affordable housing.", "The member for Windsor–Tecumseh talked about inclusionary zoning and some of the problems with the way that this bill is proposing to move forward with inclusionary zoning. The other big problem is that there is no requirement for permanence. The bill talks about inclusionary zoning, as the member said. It gives these two options for inclusionary zoning, but at the crux it does not have any kind of requirement to ensure permanence of the stock.", "Finally, to the member for Beaches–East York, the NDP recognizes fully that the market has a very important role to play, but this bill suggests that just by clearing away a few regulations, the market will step in and solve it.

In fact, I don’t know if you noticed: I was over chatting with the Minister of Housing on this very issue, trying to convince him to come to Kitchener–Waterloo and to Waterloo region to show him the great successes that we had in my region when it comes to dealing with affordable housing. We have a very caring, a very concerned and a very proactive approach to providing a good supply of affordable housing in my region.", "When municipalities had this responsibility downloaded to them about 15 years ago by the previous Conservative government of Mike Harris—and I will tell you that in my region—I was working as a reporter then—my local municipal leaders didn’t use the word “downloading”; they used the word “dumping.” They had it dumped in their laps. But they rose to the occasion of dealing with this challenge. I can tell you now that our region has added and now operates 2,700 affordable housing rental units. This is in the city of Kitchener, in Waterloo, in Cambridge, and in Woolwich, Wellesley and Wilmot townships.", "These buildings are a mix of subsidized and non-subsidized market units. In all, there are over 30 of these buildings where we have affordable housing units. I will say, to the member opposite in the NDP and her concern about the private stock of housing: In my region, I will say that more than half of these affordable housing units are being provided by private developers who have a very big social conscience. If it were not for them, we would not have all of this affordable housing. I met with some recently who wanted to talk to me about perhaps government grants that are available and how they can provide more.", "Again, in my community, where we have groups like the Mennonite Central Committee—their headquarters for eastern Canada are situated in Kitchener—they have a very big social conscience, and this is part of their responsibility, caring about mitigating poverty by providing affordable housing.", "I know that our government is going toward this commitment, addressing this issue with affordable housing, and it is very much appreciated in my region of Waterloo. I know that they’re very much looking forward to having a visit from the housing minister and finding out how this bill is going to work and how it’s going to help them.

So for the people who are watching at home right now who might be wondering what the highlights in the bill are, let me share some of that with you.", "If it is passed, this bill is going to create a meaningful increase in the supply of affordable housing units. We want to work with municipalities on perhaps expanding zoning to allow for more housing. We want to assure more stability and security for city service managers as well as social housing and not-for-profit co-operative housing providers. If we are going to do this, if we’re going to provide more affordable housing, we do need to listen to the people who are actually doing this and getting their feedback for their best practices.", "We want to allow social housing tenants to keep more of their income without having to face higher rents or face eviction. The biggest part of expenditure for most people is your housing. If we can reduce the cost, that person who was low-income, who may be unemployed, is going to save more of their income to do things like provide food for themselves and their family, and other things that they need to pay for.", "We’re going to make it easier for municipalities and their corporations to work with the private sector developers to provide affordable housing in their communities.

As I said yesterday, Barrie in particular desperately needs affordable housing. The statistics came out last year saying that the five most expensive places for rental housing are (1) Vancouver, (2) Toronto, (3) Calgary, (4) Edmonton and (5) Barrie, Ontario—my riding. That is very sad because you would not think that a community of 146,000 would desperately need affordable housing, but we do.", "Throughout the consultations on Bill 7, we heard a common view that municipalities should be given the flexibility to tailor inclusionary zoning to local social and economic conditions. We want to ensure that municipalities have this flexibility, and that includes finding a balance between inclusionary zoning policies and section 37.", "Section 37 of the Planning Act permits the municipality to authorize increases in allowable height and/or density through the zoning bylaw in return for community benefit like daycare spaces, transit improvements and heritage preservation.", "Bill 7 would restrict municipalities applying inclusionary zoning from using section 37 except as provided for in the regulation. In some instances, it might be appropriate for section 37 and inclusionary zoning to coexist. That’s why Bill 7, if passed, would allow the minister to make a regulation that could specify the circumstances under which a municipality may use section 37 with inclusionary zoning.", "Bill 7 would also help to increase the supply of affordable housing by exempting secondary suites in new homes from development charges. On January 1, 2012, this government enabled municipalities to have secondary suites. In Barrie, we do have secondary suites, and they have helped a bit. However, we desperately need more affordable housing.", "If passed, the legislative amendment would require municipalities to exempt second suites in new residential homes from development charges. Currently, a municipality cannot charge a development charge for building a second unit in an existing home. The proposed amendment would help reduce the cost of developing second suites in new homes.", "Second suites are valuable because they provide community benefits that include an additional supply of affordable housing rental units, which is what we’re looking for. They also provide income-integrated neighbourhoods that better support public transit, local businesses and the local labour market. They provide job creation in the construction and renovation industry, increased neighbourhood densities and more effective infrastructure use. They also intensify the use of existing housing stock.", "Secondary units also provide direct benefits to the individuals that include an additional income stream for a homeowner; options for elderly homeowners to age in place; options for elderly homeowners to house live-in caregivers; and options for families to house elderly family members.", "I urge everyone to pay close attention to this bill and pass it.

As I mentioned briefly the other day when we were debating this, Guelph actually also has a real issue with affordable housing. I think it tends to go with university towns: Students are competing for low rental.", "There’s been a lot of commentary this morning about secondary suites. I happened to grow up not too far from the university. In the neighbourhood I grew up in, at least half of the houses, probably, had secondary suites for students in the basement. In fact, that was the way a lot of people paid their mortgage.", "But it also provided great housing at low cost for students and actually had the advantage that the landlord lived upstairs so the neighbourhood didn’t become a student slum, which can sometimes happen when entire houses are taken over by students. It was a wonderful solution for helping people pay the mortgage and finding affordable housing for students—and actually found a great husband for me, because my husband happened to be in a basement suite across the street from the house I grew up in. So that’s an added benefit to secondary suites: husband-finding.", "The other thing I wanted to talk about was the concept of flexibility in the way we look at affordable housing. Sometimes we have very strict notions about, “We must have social housing that’s like this.” In fact, having a more flexible view allows you to build much more integrated neighbourhoods.", "In Guelph, we’ve got some examples of great partnerships, both with private developers and with non-profit. For example, one of the affordable housing projects for seniors in Guelph was actually carried out by the St. Joseph’s foundation. In Guelph, St. Joseph’s health care is a combination of the complex and continuing care hospital, long-term care and outpatient rehab, so they have a lot of outpatient services as well. They also have a lot of land. What the foundation decided to do was to work with the county on an affordable housing project for seniors, which is great because that means the seniors are next to all those services for seniors. Not only do they have affordable housing; they also have some of the outpatient health services that they can connect to right next door. That’s a really good, effective partnership.", "Another partnership that we have that has worked really well was with a private developer who had bought what was sort of vernacularly known in Guelph as the old bus barns. But the old bus barns had a history before that. The old bus barns were actually the pre-Prohibition powerhouse for the old Silver Creek Brewery. For those of you who have watched your TV ads carefully, you might know that Silver Creek was originally Sleeman, and of course Sleeman got shut down during Prohibition for a little bit of bootlegging.", "What was the powerhouse eventually became the bus barns for Guelph transportation, and then they outgrew these buildings. A private developer bought the bus barns and had a combined project where the actual old stone buildings got turned into very cool, upscale units, but at the back—again, there was enough property to do this—there was also some affordable housing with lower-income rental units. So it’s this great, mixed-use development of affordable apartments and upscale apartments.", "I mentioned the other day that that same developer, Tom Lammer, right now is working on some derelict tennis courts. Again, it will be an affordable housing project for seniors, and it will be a combination of affordable units and upscale units, because it’s a great location downtown. It will be that combination again. It goes to both the concept of flexibility and the concept of inclusionary zoning where you’ve got more than one type of housing, as it were, and in this case all in the same building.", "Thank you.

They’re on a list and they can’t get the affordable housing that they require, or they are currently in affordable housing units and they want to stay there. The housing prices in the city of Toronto, as you know, have skyrocketed. My riding of Davenport, being a very urban, downtown Toronto riding, is a prime example of this, where prices have increased substantially in the last year.", "There are many seniors who live in my community who immigrated to Davenport from their countries many, many years ago. They want to stay in Davenport—it’s where their local church is; it’s where their local grocery store is; it’s where their neighbours are; it’s where their seniors’ groups are—but they can’t afford to stay in their homes.", "Affordable housing, especially in my riding of Davenport, for seniors is an urgent need and in great demand. To help with this, Bill 7 will provide a range of planning, financial and other tools through the Promoting Affordable Housing Act to help municipalities create more affordable housing.", "Speaker, one of the most exciting new tools that Bill 7 proposes is inclusionary zoning. It would allow municipalities to require private sector developers to include affordable housing units in their residential development proposals. This would enable the private sector to play a much larger role in providing affordable housing.", "In Davenport, there are a number of new developments happening right now. If we were to include affordable housing in these units that are currently going up, it would definitely contribute to improving the housing situation in the city of Toronto.", "If passed, Bill 7 would enable, or, where prescribed, require municipalities to pass zoning bylaws for inclusionary zoning. Bill 7 would also require municipalities that pass inclusionary zoning bylaws to provide reports and information concerning the affordable housing units as prescribed, and to establish a procedure for monitoring and ensuring the units remain affordable over time.", "By creating these zoning allowances, areas like my riding of Davenport can create a large number of affordable housing units, as there are constantly new buildings being developed in my community.", "With inclusive communities, those who are in need of affordable housing are included within the community, leading to a change in the way communities think about affordable housing. This is about changing the way we see others. Inclusionary zoning will help address these issues.", "Another important part of Bill 7 I would like to talk about briefly is the changes to section 37. Section 37 of the Planning Act permits a municipality to authorize increases in allowable height and/or density through the zoning bylaw in return for community benefits, like daycare spaces, transit improvements and heritage preservation. In Davenport, we are already seeing these discussions happen at many of the community meetings in my riding, as constituents highlight the need for affordable housing projects in Davenport.", "In Bill 7, the changes that are being proposed would restrict municipalities applying inclusionary zoning from using section 37, except as provided by regulation.", "So it’s very important, as we continue to debate this bill—" ],

With the rising cost of housing, that means that the cost of rental units goes up as well. We’re all aware of that.", "One thing that hasn’t been mentioned today is the cost of getting approval for permits to create those secondary suites in the areas once they get approval to rezone and to build secondary suites. Obviously, the municipalities have to provide those permits and do the proper inspections. The cost of applying for a permit for a housing unit in the Toronto area is between $20,000 and $40,000. Well, that cost has to be recouped by the owner of the property, to the renters. So I think that it really requires better coordination between the province and all the municipalities: how to reduce the red tape, how to reduce the cost of negotiating the permits and how to speed it up—because just here in Toronto, it often takes a year and a half to two years just to get the permits. We could wave a magic wand and we could enforce—our cousins over on the municipal side aren’t very happy when they hear of us forcing things on them. They like to represent their constituents and their needs as well—but to sit down and work together on how we can get that whole process to move much quicker so that the permits could be issued, the construction can get going and the affordable housing can be achieved the way we want it. We also need to work with the system and ensure that so-called bad tenants are dealt with speedily so that people are interested in having tenants." ],

There are 5,500 families on a wait-list; 600 of them are homeless right now as I stand up and speak before you today.", "A new piece in affordable housing is seniors. I go to seniors’ homes; I go to places with seniors—Coronation Centre in Niagara Falls. They’re saying that we’ve got to do something for seniors around affordable housing.

We certainly recognize that. This is a very complex issue. There is no one answer to making sure that we have adequate and suitable and affordable housing across the province. That’s why we’ve taken the time to talk to stakeholders right across the province many times over, to make sure that we can put solutions on the table, whether it be exclusionary zoning, as we did back in 2011 with secondary suites—that’s another tool.

Having had the privilege and the opportunity to represent a large part of Waterloo region between the years 1999 and 2007, as we discussed—the townships of Wellesley, Woolwich and Wilmot, as well as a southwestern portion of the city of Kitchener—I had a tremendous opportunity to work with the local officials in Waterloo region and would again confirm that they do a great job and they’ve shown leadership.", "I would also add our perspective within the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party: We believe that there needs to be affordable housing for the people of Ontario, as well, but we also believe that there needs to be a large role for the private sector. We remind the New Democrats and the Liberals from time to time that the government can’t afford to build all the affordable housing. We need to ensure that the private sector has a role.", "Certainly, through the early 1990s, when we saw a large expansion of the government-run affordable housing program under the leadership of the New Democrats, we used to say, “This affordable housing is anything but affordable for the taxpayer,” because we saw significant cost overruns in projects that were estimated to cost a certain amount and the eventual cost was way out of control. So we have to keep that in mind too, as we discuss this issue, and ensure that there is an appropriate role for the private sector to ensure that the citizens of Ontario can afford the decent housing that they live in and ensure, going forward, that the legislation, which ensures the system is there, is in the public interest." ],

We want to see that municipalities have the ability to compel new development to include affordable housing. We want to give them the autonomy, the flexibility and the power to do this.", "We want to be able to alter zoning, as well, because there are some communities where, if they can add attics or basement apartments, that is going to increase the stock. They need to be able to do this without facing any kind of punitive measures. You also heard discussion this morning, Speaker, on allowing secondary units in buildings and homes. We support that. We’re also considering exempting secondary suites in new homes from development charges.

So giving city service managers more flexibility in delivering social housing and preventing unnecessary evictions from social housing are all part of this act.", "I share with you some of the success stories from my region: 2,700 units have been added, a mix of private and public over the years.

Members of the Legislature will know that, while a regional councillor within the region of Durham, I was the chair of the advisory committee on affordable housing, the president of the Durham Region Non-Profit Housing Corp. and, last, the chair of the Health and Social Services Committee.", "One of the by-products of that process was the development of a new Affordable and Seniors’ Housing Task Force. The task force had a focus in three primary areas, one of which was to review information and the supply of the region’s current rental housing and policy tools and to consider all of the tools on housing policy—in particular, the Durham 10-year housing plan in order to examine all the tools for the municipalities that comprise the region of Durham to support existing social housing units and encourage new ones. Equally important, Speaker, is to foster collaboration with the federal and provincial governments, as well as businesses, agencies and institutions. As a by-product of all of that activity, the region of Durham will ensure that the outcomes of that deliberation will be provided to the Minister of Housing.", "Speaker, I bring forward the Durham perspective because municipal governments are on the front line, responding to community housing needs, and the problems associated with affordable housing are wide and deep, as we’ve heard previously. Any initiatives, based on my experience, that have to be undertaken must be collaborative.", "Let’s turn for a moment to Bill 7. There are definite areas where this bill can be improved. For instance, schedule 2 repeals the elderly person’s housing act, which allowed aid to charitable or municipal corporations that received a loan under the National Housing Act. While this act may no longer be required, the fact that affordable housing wait times for seniors have increased from 2.5 years to 4.4 years shows that more needs to be done, especially within the context of an aging demographic across the province. The basis for that is proven in the statistics that are provided on a yearly basis by the Ontario Ministry of Finance.", "Further, in schedule 3, I’m disappointed that the government has chosen not to amend the requirement under the Housing Services Act for housing providers to purchase natural gas and insurance through the Housing Services Corp. I know that my colleague the member of provincial Parliament for Oxford, in his capacity as the official opposition critic for municipal affairs and housing, has long been an advocate on that issue. In fact, Bill 8, the Housing Services Corporation Accountability Act, which he has introduced in previous sessions as well as this one, seeks to correct this very issue. Bill 8 would save affordable housing providers money on natural gas and insurance by removing the mandatory requirement to purchase them through the Housing Services Corp. Speaker, Toronto Community Housing alone has said that they could save $6.3 million a year if they were allowed to purchase natural gas at the best price instead of being forced to buy through the Housing Services Corp.", "We see this at a time when mayors across the country are appealing to the provincial and federal governments to do more about affordable housing. Recently, the mayor of Toronto said that he was “disappointed that the new government in Ottawa, now being one year in, and the provincial government, being several years in ... haven’t stepped forward with more.” Mayor Tory went on to say that “in the case of the province, they’ve done what I’ll call the tiniest little kernel.”", "The previous version of the affordable housing strategy promised that an annual report would be prepared, auditing the progress on the performance indicators, yet they’ve never been released. We’re still waiting for them. The only real outcome is that every year, the wait-list for affordable housing hits a new record high.", "In schedule 4, despite the claims to the contrary, Bill 7 gives the government the ability to implement inclusionary zoning. Now, this is despite the fact that many of the questions from municipalities, including the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, as to how inclusionary zoning would be implemented have not been defined.", "In schedule 5, under the Residential Tenancies Act, we see prescribed maintenance standards for enforcement, which have been downloaded onto municipalities. This change downloads new costs onto municipalities at a time when most are struggling to keep their taxes within the present cost of living.", "Speaker, I also read with interest a letter written by the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, specifically to its provincial planning policy branch in June of this year. The letter has several recommendations. In particular, it said, “We recommend municipal discretion on issues such as depth of affordability and affordability targets, units set aside, thresholds, incentives and minimum requirements for units developed through inclusionary zoning policies.", "“Local housing and homelessness plans have been developed to guide municipal priorities on affordable housing investment and local governments are in the best position to determine when and how to implement inclusionary zoning policies. They are also in the best position to determine who in their community needs access to affordable housing and the type and size of housing that is required.”", "The recommendation, which I support, simply stated, was that local municipal authorities are the best ones to determine when and how to implement inclusionary zoning policies. It’s also recommended that the provincial government specify a common measure for affordability that is responsive to Ontarians’ income and not to rapidly rising real estate markets.", "Speaker, the letter concluded with the observation that the bill as currently drafted prevents municipalities from accepting cash in lieu of units as part of its inclusionary housing policy. Cash in lieu, it concluded, allows municipalities to set lower thresholds for their inclusionary zoning policies.", "Enabling cash in lieu would allow municipalities to finance or incent the development of much-needed affordable rental housing or to further leverage federal-provincial housing programs. We understand the need for more affordable housing but have concerns that inclusionary zoning as proposed in this bill would increase the cost of housing for all homeowners and renters.", "Further, after they introduced Bill 7, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing launched a consultation with stakeholders on key questions such as who would be eligible for the units, what percentage of the units should be required to be affordable, and whether that should be up to the municipality. All of these aforementioned questions are concerns that should have been considered and answered before, not after, the legislation was introduced.", "Speaker, I also read with great interest a well-researched article in the Globe and Mail yesterday. The story talked about how affordability for housing in the greater Toronto area has reached an all-time low. However, further to this, they pointed out the red tape that exists, specifically when it comes to permits for building new homes. The story quoted a study entitled New Homes and Red Tape in Ontario: Residential Land-Use Regulation in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, which pointed out that long and uncertain wait times are reducing the potential for the supply of housing in the greater Golden Horseshoe. I’d like to quote the final paragraph, Speaker, because it’s something I wholeheartedly agree with: “World-class, growing regions such as the [greater Golden Horseshoe] can only remain successful if their most important asset—people—can find appropriate housing. Reducing barriers to the construction of new homes can help ensure that Canada’s largest urban area will keep attracting and retaining the best and brightest....”", "What’s clear is that we need to reduce the regulatory burden in the system in order to make sure that we have an adequate supply of housing for people in the greater Toronto area. Governing is about priorities, and the Liberal government has prioritized handing out contracts for energy we don’t need over addressing affordable housing and the needs of Ontarians. This government has had 13 years to fix the wait-list, yet we now have more than 171,000 families waiting for housing, the highest it’s ever been.", "As I near the end of my speaking time, I’d like to sum up by saying that while we’ll be supporting the bill to go to the committee, we do expect to have some amendments. Bill 7 adds a number of new costs for municipalities, including requiring enumeration of homeless people, administering the inclusionary zoning program, and inspection and enforcement of the prescribed maintenance standards—" ],

  "text" : [ "Well, thank you very much, Speaker.", "About two years ago, I moved a motion in this House that essentially asked members to say that the practice of fluoridating drinking water was essential to minimizing tooth decay and helping restore tooth enamel. In other words, was this or was this not a good idea? Unanimously, members said this was a good idea, so this resolution is going to build on that by asking this House to take a position that all Ontario communities, to the fullest extent practicable, have access to fluoridated drinking water.", "Now, Speaker, I got interested in this after having met some of our local Halton-Peel dentists. Almost in passing, one of them talked about the danger of having Peel’s drinking water no longer fluoridated, and I would add that such a motion is actually before Peel council now. Now, our residents of Peel constitute one in nine of the province of Ontario’s population, and the prospect of egregiously exposing one out of nine people in Ontario to completely foreseeable and preventable tooth decay is one that has me troubled and also a lot of our people who live in Mississauga, Brampton and Caledon.", "So I’d like to make my resolution of two years ago much more specific and ask the province to act, and to act in very specific ways, to take an outdated act, the Fluoridation Act, repeal it and replace it with specific provisions in the Ontario Health Protection and Promotion Act and amend the Ontario Municipal Act, which removes from municipalities the ability to opt out or fail to opt into municipal water fluoridation treatment.", "Now, I was also surprised in the last municipal election at the number of fringe candidates who had thrown into their literature the notion that somehow or other fluoridation of municipal drinking water was anything but beneficial. In fact, it’s very, very beneficial, and it’s something that, across the province, the province is doing very well. Most of our communities have access to fluoridated drinking water.", "Just as a quick recap: Fluoride is a naturally occurring element in drinking water. It’s found in nature, it’s found in all water, and it’s combined with minerals and rocks in the soil. When water passes over the soil or through the rocks, it dissolves some fluoride compounds and releases fluoride ions into the water. It’s happened since time immemorial.", "Where fluoride concentration is somewhere between 0.8 to 1/1000th of one gram per litre of the water—in other words, 0.8 to one milligram per litre—then drinking such fluoridated drinking water regularly makes the outer layer of teeth stronger and less likely to get cavities.", "The reason that this link was found was that in the early part of the last century, researchers wondered why rates of dental decay varied so widely. After years of study, it came down to the naturally occurring level of fluoride in different communities. For example, in the province of Ontario, Stratford is one city where naturally occurring drinking water contains exactly the right concentration of fluoride. As a consequence, without needing to fluoridate its drinking water, Stratford residents benefit from exactly the right concentration of fluoride. In other communities that have lower levels, what researchers found was that bringing that level of fluoride up to the 0.8 to one milligram per litre also served the purpose of reducing tooth decay and reducing cavities.", "Something that’s worth pointing out is that, after the common cold, tooth decay is the most frequent disease in the world, and it’s one of the leading causes of absences from school. Let’s put it another way: We are in October now, where, in my community, I almost sound like a broken record, year after year, urging people to take the flu shot. I say, “Take the flu shot, because the flu shot is free and it works and you won’t get the flu if you take the flu shot.” Indeed, I have yet to find someone who has taken the flu shot regularly, as I do, year after year—this will now be the 15th year in a row that I’ve taken the flu shot—and I’ve never got the flu.", "Similarly, why wouldn’t you want drinking water that strengthens your teeth and protects them from decay? After all, we pasteurize our milk to protect ourselves from dangerous bacteria. We pasteurize our milk and we treat our food to ensure that we’re protected from salmonella, E. coli, listeria, and a whole host of other things. We also add small trace amounts of chlorine to our drinking water to kill similar bacteria in our water.", "In 2012, Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Arlene King, published a report on oral health. I talked about it two years ago and I’m going to repeat some of these points now. It made four recommendations for action by the province of Ontario. I’m going to read recommendation number one verbatim. It goes as follows: “Conduct a review of current policies and mechanisms to ensure that all Ontarians have access to optimally fluoridated drinking water.”", "The fact is that tooth decay and gum disease are not only preventable, they’re easy to prevent. Fluoridation works by just having a drink of water, and it reaches everybody served by a fluoridated supply of municipal drinking water. You don’t need private dental insurance to get access to it.", "Most municipalities in Ontario bring the levels of naturally occurring fluoride in their water up to this optimal level of 0.8 to one milligram per litre by adding the difference at the filtration plant where their water is treated.", "Another way to see the cause and effect of tooth decay in the fluoridation of water is to look at areas where misguided city councils have listened to the stupidity, the junk science and the nonsense and removed fluoride from their water. One area is near where I grew up, in Dorval, Quebec, where within three years, the rates of tooth decay had doubled. Another is in the city of Calgary, where the local residents, having seen their rates of tooth decay soar, have asked city council to put fluoride back in their water. Their city council has refused to listen to them. In the Windsor-Essex region, there was also an action by city council a number of years ago to remove fluoride from water.", "One of the dentists who has worked closely with me is a wonderful guy named Dr. Charles Frank, and I’d like to read again some of the comments that he made that were very helpful to me. To use his words exactly:", "“It can take a few years before the effects of removal of fluoride from the water supply become noticeable. It hasn’t been very long” here in Windsor-Essex “and already I’ve noticed an increase in the level of dental decay....", "“I treated three children from Windsor, all between the ages of four and five years of age, who, due to their young age, and the quantity of dental treatment needed, required this treatment in hospital as outpatients, under general anaesthesia.", "“A child of this age normally has 20 teeth. The first child had nine teeth which needed to be treated; the next, 13; and the last, eight. This is far in excess of what I am used to seeing in Windsor for children of this age.", "“As a health care professional, it has been disheartening to see this needless increase in preventable dental disease in these children—one of the more vulnerable segments of our population.", "“As an aside, each of these children are on the social services program administered by the city, another vulnerable segment of our community.”", "Speaker, it seems that Windsor city council chose the expedient route of saying, “We’re not going to repair or upgrade our fluoridation treatment, but we would rather spend many more times that in looking after children who contract foreseeable and preventable dental disease.”", "Most of the so-called arguments against water fluoridation range between the silly and the paranoid. I’ve actually read through some of them because, following my last private member’s resolution, I got a lot of abusive messages on my Facebook page. I looked them up, and most of them actually came from outside Canada. In reading them, most were simply paranoia. I especially enjoyed reading the one about fluorine being a mind-control agent used by dictators.", "The fact is that the real science is methodical, it’s clear, it’s consistent and it’s conclusive. Fluoride in the right concentrations, coupled with regular dental care, means stronger tooth enamel and less tooth decay and gum disease.", "I have asked our Ministry of Health to step up and to implement the actions of Ontario’s then-Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Arlene King, and to insist that all Ontario municipal drinking water be treated not just with chlorine to kill bacteria, but fluorine to prevent tooth decay, just as all milk in this province must be pasteurized and all children vaccinated against preventable diseases.", "It’s time for our health care professionals—particularly our dentists, our doctors, our hospitals, our community care access centres and our private health clinics—not to take the good sense and the sound science of fluoridation for granted. I have asked them to use their access to patients not merely to treat them, but also to raise their awareness and that of their families and to teach them why their water is treated with fluoride, and why it’s important that communities that are already fluoridated remain so and communities that are not fluoridated as soon as possible adopt the good, sound, sensible practice of fluoridating their drinking water.", "I also want to acknowledge the work from the Ontario Dental Association and especially my dentists in the Halton-Peel Dental Association for the help and support that they have given me—where all of our dentists have said that they see their job as helping people to build a better smile, and not by spending their time, their patients’ money and their families’ money repairing foreseeable and preventable dental diseases.", "Thank you, Speaker. I’ve appreciated the opportunity to, hopefully, make my resolution from two years ago that much more specific and that much more helpful to the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, to the province of Ontario and to my colleagues." ],

  "text" : [ "I just want to mention to everybody who might be listening at home that today we’re talking about a motion put forward by the member from Mississauga–Streetsville, from the government side of the House, about fluoridation of our water systems in the municipalities.", "I’ve often stood here and said that we in the PC caucus are the party of science. We’re always talking about data. We’re always asking for scientific evidence to support any claims or any bills that are being put forward by the government.", "I think fluoridation is actually an interesting topic to debate here. We have the growing scientific evidence, which continues to grow, to show that fluoridation of the water reduces decay of teeth. Most people support that science, I think, but there are people who have concerns. I don’t think it’s helpful in the debate to say things like—and I’m going to quote the member opposite, who said, “silly” and “paranoid,” that anybody who doesn’t agree with this is somehow silly and paranoid. I don’t think that’s helpful. I think that people are entitled to their opinion and to their concerns, and I think that there have been times where common perceptions have been proven to be completely false. I don’t think that whether or not the earth is round or the earth is flat is debated any more, but we do know that there was a time when people had very strong beliefs one way or the other, and people were even killed for their beliefs. People feel very strongly about this, and I think we have to respect them, even if we don’t agree with them. Even if we don’t support them, we definitely have to respect them.", "We also have to respect our municipalities. Many people here served as municipal councillors before they came to this House. When they move—some people would say up the ladder, other people would say down the ladder—to provincial or federal politics, I’m very surprised when somehow they forget their roots and how they felt serving the residents of their community on various councils throughout the province. Then they come to the Legislature and they somehow feel that they should be ordering those same municipalities who are just really representing the interests of their residents.", "So I think that, yes, we have overwhelming scientific evidence that fluoridation reduces tooth decay, that it protects for children, and it also protects adults’ teeth. It helps to close the gap in decay rates among various groups and it saves money, of course, by reducing the need for fillings. And as provincial legislators, we have to be conscious of the fact that for many in our communities, we are covering dental care. We are not here to debate about whether we should be covering dental care for everybody, but there is a significant number of people whose dental care is covered by the province, and we want to be concerned about that budget.", "I’m reminded, when we’re talking about fluoridation of our water systems, of the vaccination—I don’t want to call it a war; the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care is nodding at me. But it’s also not helpful—we have people who come to our constituency offices who sometimes ask us to notarize the forms for the schools saying that, because of their beliefs, they will not be vaccinating their children. Everybody sort of deals with it in their own way; my way, the couple of times that I have had to deal with it, has been to say, “I will sign this form. I’m not agreeing with what you’re doing, but I will notarize your signature, if you give me 10 minutes of your time.” I explain to people that they must be aware that there are people who cannot be vaccinated, children who, because of health care reasons—they may have had cancer, they may be going through cancer treatment, other health care problems—cannot be vaccinated and I would prefer to save the few spots in our schools for unvaccinated children, if we can call it sort of a virtual spot. I prefer to save that for children who cannot be vaccinated. Those who can be vaccinated I feel very strongly should be vaccinated.", "But on the other hand, I respect parents’ rights to decide what is best for their children. Even if I don’t agree with them, I do respect their rights. And I respect the citizens of Ontario who feel very strongly about fluoridation. I know that there was a time when they claimed it was a communist plot to somehow cause health care problems. We don’t hear that any longer, but we hear a lot of other conspiracy theories abound about intentionally somehow poisoning or making people sick.", "Well, we all know that that’s not the case. I think the scientific evidence is overwhelming that water should be fluoridated. It is possible that certain segments of the populations—very minute—who have certain health care challenges maybe shouldn’t be drinking tap water if it is fluoridated, and they have to drink bottled water. I would make the suggestion to the government that, if there is scientific evidence or if there isn’t, maybe they should fund some scientific studies to show that, if there are certain segments of the population that should not be drinking fluoridated water, that somehow they receive some kind of tax credit, tax break or funding for bottled water.", "I think it is far simpler to say that certain minute segments of the population should have to bring outside water in and not use tap water for ingesting, rather than saying that the entire population should not have fluoridated water and should somehow fluoridate their own water. I think that’s not feasible. The scientific data doesn’t support that. But I certainly wouldn’t call people “silly” and “paranoid” for suggesting it.", "I think that we’re here to represent everybody and also to respect the municipal councils throughout the province of Ontario who may choose to not fluoridate their water. I think we want to sit down and we want to have that discussion. I don’t know if a motion making demands is the way to have the right dialogue. We know that a motion isn’t a bill. It can’t be enforced. If this motion passes, we can’t go to the municipalities and say, “You must fluoridate your water, because we passed a motion on October 6 in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.” That will not be effective; it will not happen. But I don’t know that it contributes to the dialogue with those municipalities and with the residents who are concerned about it if we make unilateral demands.", "There are some myths and facts that I got off the Internet. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to speak personally with people who have concerns one way or the other, because we just found out about this motion late in the afternoon yesterday. I’m just going to read what I did find.", "This is from Campaign for Dental Health, so I’m sure that people who are concerned about fluoridated water will say, “Well, the dental industry has an agenda.” I kind of find it hard to believe because, personally, I think that, if the dental network—I won’t say just dentists because we have a lot of people who work in dental health who aren’t dentists. But if they had an agenda, Madam Speaker, wouldn’t their agenda be to not fluoridate water, because then people will have more tooth decay and they will have more business? Here we have a situation where the dental industry, if we want to call it that, supports fluoridated water. I can’t imagine what their agenda would be.", "“Myth #1: ‘Fluoride doesn’t belong in drinking water.’”", "Basically, their truth to counter the myth that fluoride doesn’t belong in drinking water is to say: “Fluoride occurs naturally in water, though rarely at the optimal level to protect teeth....", "“Fluoride exists naturally in ... all water supplies and even in various brands of bottled water.” That’s maybe a concern for people who are drinking bottled water, thinking they’re not getting any fluoride; they’re obviously getting some amounts.", "“Myth #2: ‘Adding fluoride is forced medication.’", "“The truth: Numerous scientific studies and reviews have recognized fluoride as an important nutrient for strong healthy teeth....", "“Myth #3: ‘Our city council can save money by ending fluoridation of our water system.’", "“The truth: Fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay and promote healthy communities.” Again, we never want to see that we’re saving money at one level of government only to spend much more money than what we’re saving at the one level of government at a higher level of government.", "The last myth is “Myth #4: ‘Fluoridation is a “freedom of choice” issue. People should choose when or if they have fluoride in their water.’", "“The truth: Fluoridation is a public health measure, a modest community-wide investment that benefits everyone.”", "I’m just going to end, Madam Speaker, by saying that, here in the Legislature, we get to debate a lot of very interesting things, but one of the things we always have to remember is that you don’t do something to hurt one community just to benefit a much smaller community. Well, I think the opposite is true with fluoridation. The scientific evidence is there and, unless something changes with that evidence, we are helping a majority of our constituents by supporting fluoridation, and there are very few who seem to be against it. Thank you. I’m going to share my time with my colleague." ],

I should state for the record that New Democrats support municipal water fluoridation.", "That said, this motion is not without its problems. My primary issue with this motion is its premise that tooth decay in “all Ontarians” can and will be prevented through mandatory water fluoridation, which is why I wanted to refer to the specific language that’s contained in this motion. The problem is that the member’s reference to “all Ontarians” means only the Ontarians who drink fluoridated municipal water. It leaves out rural Ontarians who reside outside of municipal boundaries and who rely on personal wells for water, rural Ontarians who reside within a municipality but who live in areas too rural for municipally supplied water—of which there are many in Kenora–Rainy River—and many indigenous people.", "As of August 31 of this year, there are 28 First Nation communities in my riding of Kenora–Rainy River alone that are under boil-water advisories or “do not drink” orders, and 43 First Nation communities in similar situations within Ontario. This means that nearly half of all 89 First Nation communities with undrinkable water across Canada are communities right here in Ontario. This is a disgrace. The Wynne government should be very concerned and very ashamed of the statistics that I just mentioned, and it should be the focus of this government’s attention. Instead, we have a government that seems to only focus on recognizing indigenous people in speeches and on changing the name of the ministerial portfolio that is charged with solving this provincial crisis.", "Renaming the ministry to include the word “reconciliation” in the name does not mean that reconciliation has occurred. Indigenous people need more from this government than words. Communities are looking to this government for action. When this Liberal member talks about providing fluoridation to all Ontarians, what he really means is select Ontarians, which begs the question: How can this government step up and actually prevent tooth decay and provide fluoridation to all Ontarians?", "The answer is, first and foremost, to fix the water crisis that we have in First Nation communities right here in Ontario. The answer is to do it also through universal dental care, recognizing that our teeth are part of our body and intrinsically linked to our whole body health. New Democrats believe that dental services should be provided to all Ontarians, along with other health services provided by OHIP. The bottom line is that we will never be able to fully prevent tooth decay and the resulting chronic health conditions in children and adults across this province until we implement universal dental care.", "Right now, the costs of seeking dental care are totally prohibitive for many Ontarians. Between the out-of-control hydro rates and the cost of food, housing and insurance, there just isn’t money left over to shell out hundreds of dollars to get teeth treated, never mind investing in regular dental hygiene. The money is just not there. Asking families whose budgets are already stretched tight and who, in the north in particular, are left to travel hundreds of kilometres to afford basics like groceries and health care to go in to see their dentist for regular preventive oral care just isn’t going to happen.", "If we really truly want to tackle tooth-decay-related diseases such as heart disease, respiratory conditions, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as many others, and crack down on emergency room visits and other hospitalizations that are being funded through our health care system, this government would improve water quality in First Nation communities and implement universal dental care for Ontarians." ],

From the never-ending battles to get them to brush their teeth when they’re young or trying to convince them to go to the dentist on their own once they’ve gotten a little built older, it’s always important to get your children to take care of their teeth.", "As most of you know, I grew up in a family with not a lot of cabbage. We didn’t have access to the best dental care because, let’s be honest, it’s really expensive. Thankfully, I was still able to have good teeth coming out of that and that is at least in part because I grew up in a community that had fluoride in the water in an area of Niagara where many communities had naturally occurring fluoride in the water.", "Unfortunately, there are many communities in my area that don’t put fluoride in the water. I think it is unfortunate that those communities don’t have fluoride in the water. In 2008, Niagara regional council decided not to introduce fluoride in the water, not because they didn’t think it was effective, but because they thought it would cost too much money. I know that the member from Welland, who is not here today, was part of that debate and made it very clear that she supported introducing fluoride across the Niagara region.", "I understand that we all want to ensure our tax dollars are being spent wisely, but I think those councillors who voted against the plan might have missed the boat.", "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated $38 in avoidable costs for dental treatment for every dollar invested in community water fluoridation.", "Quite frankly, the process of putting fluoride in drinking water is a safe and effective method of promoting good oral health and preventing tooth decay that has been proven beyond a doubt.", "Putting fluoride in drinking water is a protective measure for at-risk groups, particularly low-income adults and seniors without access to both private dental insurance and limited provincial dental health programs.", "Although it is often overlooked by our public health system, oral health is something we all need to pay close attention to. There are not a lot of people who have never suffered a toothache. We can all likely remember at one time or another when we had that pain from a toothache, and we all wanted to go to the dentist and had to wait. You might not want to remember it, but you certainly didn’t like it.", "Beyond the pain, however, oral health is an integral part to good overall health. When people don’t have good oral health, it can lead to serious side effects that can have an impact on our province. Our economy is affected through lost work and school days and expensive emergency health care costs for untreated dental problems and their side effects. So it is important that we take care of our teeth. It is important for our immediate comfort, it’s important for our current and future overall health, and it’s important for our economy.", "That is where fluoride comes in. Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and prevents tooth decay. Water naturally contains some fluoride. In some communities, natural fluoride levels are sufficient, but in others it makes sense to add a little bit.", "When we do add a little bit of fluoride, we improve oral health for a large number of people at a very low cost. In turn, we save municipalities and the province in question money when it comes to addressing more serious dental health problems and the related issues that I’ve already mentioned.", "Madam Speaker, across Ontario it’s estimated that between 70% to 75% of the people in our province have access to water that has fluoride added to it through municipal drinking water systems. That means that there are still around three million people in the province of Ontario who don’t have fluoride in their drinking water. That’s three million people who don’t have drinking water that reduces the number of cavities and reduces tooth decay. That’s three million people who are going to have to spend more of their hard-earned money on dental care than the rest of the people in this province. That’s three million people who don’t have access to what the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called one of the greatest public achievements of the 20th century. And that is three million people who don’t have access to a public health measure that was first implemented in our province in 1945. That is 71 years ago, for those trying to do the math.", "Madam Speaker, I understand that not all of those three million people would gain access to water with fluoride as a result of this bill. There are a large number of rural Ontarians who don’t get their water from municipal drinking water but instead from their own wells. Despite that, the bill and its goal of expanding access to water with fluoride in it across Ontario is an important one, and one that I am proud to be supporting today.", "I also understand that there is some opposition to adding fluoride to our water systems. There are people out there who believe that fluoride, in the small doses that are added to our water, is harmful to humans. Some of them believe that fluoride does things like lower your IQ, damage your bones, cause arthritis or even cause bone cancer. Let’s be clear as I finish up here: The scientific community has spent more than 70 years examining the results of putting fluoride in water, and they have been very clear that none of that is true." ],

I know he has brought forward health-related bills in the past as well. I want to thank him for all of his leadership.", "Madam Speaker, I just want to set the context for this bill. The context is quite simple—many of us have already talked about it—which is the fact that the evidence very clearly shows that fluoridation is good for our oral health. In fact, I was reading about a very clear example, I believe in 2011. It was the city of Calgary, which stopped the fluoridation of water. Five years later, the results are quite startlingly conclusive. Tooth decay in children in Calgary is twice the rate of tooth decay in neighbouring Edmonton, where they still continue to fluoridate the water. So I think it’s quite clear—the science and the evidence around fluoridation.", "The context for this bill is really that in the region of Peel there’s a possibility that the region is looking at not fluoridating water anymore, at discontinuing this practice. It is in this context that this bill, to some extent, comes forward. I just want to say that what Peel does makes a big difference in Ontario. If Peel were to stop fluoridating water, it would affect about a million people in Ontario. But the effect goes beyond that. Because it is such a large regional municipality, the rest of the province is looking at Peel as well. What Peel does could have a domino effect in terms of what other municipalities do.", "I’m also cognizant of the fact that fluoridating water is truly a municipal responsibility. The one thing that we’ve heard clearly from municipalities is that they would like the province to respect their jurisdiction. I happen to agree with that. I happen to agree with the sentiment that the province ought to recognize the jurisdiction of the municipalities, but there is a saying that, “With power comes responsibility.”", "So my plea to all municipalities across Ontario is to listen to the science, to listen to the evidence, and to do the right thing, which is either to start fluoridating the water, if they’re not, or, if they happen to be fluoridating water right now, to continue to fluoridate water, because that is the key to oral health. We’ve heard many, many examples of the evidence.", "The last piece that I’d like to add is that while my personal preference truly is that municipalities show the leadership that they ought to show on this file, I also recognize the need for education, because truly, this is an issue where there are people who, for whatever reason, are concerned that it might be harmful. I do believe there’s a big role for education, but I also do understand the intent of this motion, which is to show leadership, because what the region of Peel does is really important to the rest of the province.", "My plea to the region of Peel would be, not only as a local MPP but also as a resident, that they show leadership on the fluoridation issue and continue to fluoridate water." ],

It is interesting, of course, as everyone here would know, that he serves as a member from Peel region, which is kind of at the epicentre of the discussion that we’re having on this particular issue.", "I think it’s also noteworthy that both the member from Mississauga–Streetsville, who is sponsoring this motion, and the minister responsible for seniors, who spoke just a moment ago, represent Peel region electoral districts, or ridings, here in the House. I think that speaks volumes about the concern that is felt with respect to discussions that are taking place at the municipal level that may lead to a significant departure from what has been long-standing practice with respect to a very, very important public health matter.", "Our colleague the minister responsible for seniors did point out the important role that historically municipalities have played in this regard. I think it does bear repeating right off the top that everyone on this side of the House and I believe everyone across all three parties here in the Legislature understands the fundamental importance of respecting local decision-making when it comes to not just matters like this but matters that cover a wide variety of issues.", "Having said that, I would add to what’s been said so far today on this matter to say, as someone who represents a riding, the riding of Vaughan, which is a neighbour to the region of Peel, on the point that was made about the importance of setting good examples, that Peel region is a wonderful place. It’s a great neighbour to York region; it’s thriving, it’s doing well across a multitude of issues. I don’t think we would want to see, in any way, shape or form, anything take away from Peel’s reputation—the sense that people have with respect to Peel being a wonderful community in which to live and work and to raise a family.", "I will also point out that, from a public health perspective, I do find it interesting, certainly, to listen to what members of both opposition parties are saying on this matter—understanding that, depending on which part of the province you’re in, there are other challenges with respect to dealing with some of the matters that we’re talking about today.", "I will say, as someone who has lived his entire life in the greater Toronto and Hamilton area, that I do find it, in a way—“unfortunate,” perhaps, is too strong a word, but there’s a sense that I have that it is, at the very least, a little bit unfortunate that in 2016 we’re having this exact conversation here in the Legislature. I’ve been blessed throughout my life to have lived not only in Ontario, but in the greater Toronto and Hamilton area, and the notion of fluoride in our drinking water is not something that I ever expected I’d be engaging in a debate regarding when I was first elected to represent Vaughan four years ago here in the Legislature. So I understand all that.", "I will also say, going forward, as the father of two young girls—an eight-year-old and a five-year-old—making sure that the Legislature continues to work closely with all of our municipal partners so that we are in the strongest position possible to make sure we’re maintaining a standard regarding public health throughout—whether we’re talking about tooth decay or whether we’re talking about a multitude of other issues, that we’re able to provide a standard here in the province of Ontario, understanding there are challenges, depending on what part of the province we’re in. But the notion that we can provide some degree of balance or a standard across the province for my daughters’ future and for the future of so many others who live across this province is something that is so important.", "I will close by saying that I salute my colleague from Mississauga–Streetsville for bringing this matter forward. I sincerely hope that the region of Peel will do their due diligence and will come to a logical conclusion about the importance of making sure that we continue to provide fluoride in the water of those living in Peel region, and that we continue to work hard, together with all of our municipal partners, on this and a wide variety of other issues." ],

I’ll give you an example: Folks who come from abroad, from the Third World, do not have salt that has iodine added to it. Have a look at the salt box that you have in your home; it will say “iodized salt.” And with that simple, unacknowledged, silent addition—that public health quiet move—the incidence of thyroid disease has been changed, certainly in the First World, in North America.", "A similar story goes with fluoride. When I first learned that there is a region in Ontario that may be potentially removing fluoride—frankly speaking, I didn’t think this would be coming from North America. To a physician who sees the effects of tooth decay, who knows that if the optimal environment is not offered to children—and, by the way, not merely young children, but even in the pregnancy stage—for bone mineralization, for the enamel formation, for the structural integrity of teeth, then this is going to affect people on a lifelong basis.", "Many things have been said; for example, how the United Nations supports this as a massive public health initiative, and how $1 spent in terms of fluoridation of water will save something on the order of $40 or $50 of money spent in the rescue of tooth decay. All of us, whether in a personal experience or in my, for example, professional experience as a physician, know the importance of this.", "I also would just like to highlight that there are many, many jurisdictions in the world, often from the Third World—for example, they don’t vaccinate against polio; they don’t add fluoride to the water; they don’t add iodine to the salt. We who inherit those kinds of patients see the extraordinarily either moderate or super-tragic effects of those missing public health manoeuvres.", "So I would strongly support the initiative and this particular bill brought forward by my honourable colleague Bob Delaney, the MPP from Mississauga–Streetsville. Whether it’s the Ontario Medical Association, the Ontario Dental Association, the World Health Organization, the United Nations, Public Health Ontario, the ministers who are involved, obviously we deeply support—because at the end of the day, this is, I would hope, one aspect in which the municipal folks would defer to people who have long-held experience and who have processed and engaged in these issues from med school to this day—which, by the way, for me is now 30 years and counting.", "I would very strongly urge everyone in this House, whether it’s a financial aspect, a suffering avoidance—and, frankly speaking, you’ve got to respect the chemistry. Don’t Trump out on this one. This is really an important issue. I can’t believe that this is even an issue before us, as my colleague the Minister of Transportation said, in 2016." ],

You’re welcome to have your own opinion, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but what they’re not entitled to is to make up their own facts.", "Many of the speakers who were kind enough to contribute their thoughts today quoted many of the authoritative sources that support fluoridation, and those sources are overwhelming and exhaustive.", "I note to some of my colleagues who asked about it that, with regard to rural areas and people who are on wells, the motion said, “to the fullest extent practicable.” We understand that where people are spread out few and far between, it may not be practicable in 100% of the cases. The point is to get the maximum benefit to the maximum number of people with the greatest effect.", "Finally, Speaker, Peel is the epicentre now of where this propagation of anti-fluoride nonsense is going, and there are 1.5 million people in Mississauga and Brampton and Caledon who stand to be placed in harm’s way through the needless removal of fluoridation from their community drinking water.

I want to read you some of the examples.", "“Ontario Named ‘Major Hub’ for Human Trafficking,” says the Globe and Mail.", "“Dad Feels ‘Helpless’ After Daughter Targeted for Human Trafficking”—the CBC.", "“Windsor a Hub for Human Trafficking”—the Windsor Star.", "“Sex Trafficking Investigation Reveals One of Ontario’s Biggest Secrets”—the CBC.", "“Notoriously Violent” Nova Scotia “Gang Recruiting Women, Girls and Pimping Them Out in Ontario: Police”—National Post.", "These troubling stories and facts motivated me to introduce the Saving the Girl Next Door Act, which tackles the issue in four ways.", "First, the bill will make every February 22 a day of awareness of human trafficking, as that marks the date in 2007 when Canada’s Parliament unanimously condemned all forms of human trafficking and slavery. I think it’s about time that we set aside a day to help educate Ontarians on the fastest-growing crime in our province.", "Second, the Saving the Girl Next Door Act will expand current laws to allow the courts to file a protection order against a perpetrator of human trafficking or child exploitation. A protection order, similar to a restraining order, would force the trafficker to stay away from the survivor for a minimum of three years. If a trafficker breaches this protection order, they would face a penalty of up to $50,000, up to two years of jail, or both.", "Third, this bill will allow a survivor to sue their trafficker for damages. We know that the effects of human trafficking are devastating and that recovery is emotionally and financially difficult. This may help deliver a measure of justice to the victims.", "Fourth, the bill will expand the definition of “sex offence” under Christopher’s Law (Sex Offender Registry), 2000, to include offences related to the trafficking or purchasing of sexual services of persons under the age of 18. This will help to increase public awareness of the presence of traffickers in their community.", "Speaker, these are simple and effective changes that have proven their value in other jurisdictions. Manitoba, although 10 times smaller than Ontario, led the way. They invested significant financial resources, and their Legislature passed its own law on human trafficking with an emphasis on protection orders.", "As you know, we last debated this very same bill in February. I was happy to see that it received unanimous support from my colleagues at that time. But since then, the bill has also received support from over 160 municipalities throughout our province, including cities like Peterborough, North Bay, Brantford, Essex, Toronto, Oshawa, Hamilton and Cornwall.", "Unfortunately, not only has there been no legislative action on the part of the government since my bill was first introduced; their decision to prorogue forced us to start from scratch. This government is simply not taking this issue seriously, and they have not made it a priority. Even the US Department of State’s 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report singled out Ontario for not doing enough: “In Ontario, children 16 and older were not eligible for child protective care and were often diverted to co-ed youth shelters, leaving them vulnerable to recruitment into sex trafficking.”", "Over the past few months, I’ve travelled right across our province discussing the critical issue of human sex trafficking with police and front-line service providers, as well as with community groups and concerned parents. Everywhere I went, I was approached by Ontarians who were horrified to learn that sexual exploitation of our children is on the rise, and that it could happen to their kids—" ],

So I want to take this opportunity to share some feedback from my meetings with these very courageous Ontarians in order to underscore how desperate the situation really is and how important it is for the Wynne government to finally listen to those who are out there every day fighting this horrendous form of modern-day slavery.", "Early in the summer I was in Kitchener-Waterloo, where I heard from local police about how human sex trafficking is exploding—“exploding” was the word—in the region, with over a hundred online advertisements selling sexual services being posted every night. Websites hosting these ads are so easily accessible, even from your cellphone, which shows how easy it is for traffickers to operate. The Internet is also where many young girls get lured by traffickers and then trapped into a situation from which they can’t escape.", "Traffickers are skilled manipulators who have no regard for their victims. One horrifying example in the Kitchener-Waterloo area involved a 15-year-old girl who had been deliberately injected with crystal meth and exploited.", "The tactic of getting young girls addicted to drugs and exploiting them is unfortunately very common. When I visited North Bay, I was told about a girl who was trafficked across the country, but managed to escape her exploiters in Toronto and hop on a bus to North Bay. She went to the airport to escape farther. She had no identity because they strip them of their identities. The police were called. She said she had been trafficked. The local police didn’t have the resources to help her. They actually called the local MPP and said, “I have a victim here who has been trafficked. What should I do next?” They need support. They need help.", "Speaker, many trafficked girls have the incredible courage to leave, but nowhere to go. Ontario lacks specialized safe houses and transition programs that are designed to help trafficking victims. Ontario also needs to dedicate more resources to front-line training for our service providers, including the police. It shouldn’t have to fall to former victims like Timea Nagy to travel across the province on her own, without government support, training those on the front lines. If those brave individuals can come forward, they deserve to have the services available so they can escape this horrific crime.", "When I went to Kenora, I was inspired to see local victims’ services providers join with the police and community leaders in establishing the Kenora Coalition to End Human Trafficking to coordinate local efforts to protect vulnerable women and girls. One of the participants, Dr. Jacqui Linder, underscored how important it is that the public be made aware of what is happening. Unless our governments properly allocate resources, it will fall on the shoulders of a few goodwill champions, like her, who see this evil occurring.", "In Sudbury, I heard about the need for a province-wide structure to coordinate efforts to combat human sex trafficking. To this point, the House may remember that I introduced a motion in the Legislature in May 2015 calling on the government to create a multi-jurisdictional and coordinated task force, to be modelled after the successful guns and gangs task force. But again, we see no real action from this government on a proposal that would have helped coordinate the efforts of those involved in the fight against human sex trafficking.", "Finally, just last Friday, in Hamilton, Police Chief Eric Girt highlighted the importance of resources and legal tools to fight sex trafficking. He said simply that more resources mean more victims rescued.", "The common thread in the discussions I’ve had in cities across Ontario is the need for immediate action. Unlike the former Liberal Attorney General, who told us this last June, “We need to know more about human trafficking,” the front-line fighters against human trafficking are telling us the exact opposite—that we don’t need to know more; we need to get the boots on the ground right now.", "The changes proposed in my bill represent an opportunity for the government to take concrete action now. I don’t claim that the Saving the Girl Next Door Act represents the full answer to this very complex problem, but it can help victims and it can help law enforcement now.", "I once again call on the government to stop ignoring the issue, bring this bill to committee and pass it as soon as possible.

Apparently about 550 persons were trafficked in Ontario between January 2011 and December 2013. That’s the only time we’ve kept track of it. That’s a significant number of lives lost.", "I also want to make it clear that her bill is, in a sense, modelled after a federal bill, C-268, and our party, the federal NDP, voted in favour of that, as we will today in favour of hers. There’s a broader scope to this, and it’s Canada-wide, of course.", "Another thing I want to make clear—and we’ve been very vociferous in our objections, in the NDP, to the Harper Conservative bill, C-36, which essentially criminalized johns. This is a totally different area. So I want to talk to the sex trade workers out there who I’ve been in touch with: It’s a completely different issue from the issue of, predominantly, child sex trafficking—let’s name it for what it is—across the country. Although, of course, we’re vehemently opposed to that, because it criminalizes those who choose sex work, this is about those who don’t choose it, and that’s a critical distinction.", "The member talked about 14-year-olds and—exactly, it is that age group. As a kid who had some street experience myself around that age—not that young; 15, 16, and never involved in this, really, thank God. When you’re 15, first of all, you think you’re immortal, and, second of all, you’re super-sophisticated and you think you know more than your adults do. You’re incredibly vulnerable to being exploited, partly because of that, but also because—these are girls who will go to a party where drugs are involved, and the next thing they know, they’ve been doing drugs and they’re told they have to pay for them and they don’t have any money. You can see how one thing leads to another—certainly, this is coincident with the problem of making our children aware of the ramifications of drug use—and how easy it is to exploit someone who doesn’t know their rights, who’s young and impressionable and who really thinks they have all the answers and pretends, to themselves sometimes, that they’re more sophisticated and worldly than they really are. The next thing they know, they’re in a situation that’s completely out of control and there’s not a friend in sight. That’s exactly what happens here. And it doesn’t happen rarely; it happens, as we know now—550 persons in a two-year period in one province.", "I commend the government for their ads about sexual violence. They were good ads, but I hope that’s not all the response we’re going to get. I hope we’re going to see some response to this, on the government side, in some concrete fashion.", "I know from my own work in this area, about domestic violence, with Victim Services that’s just down here on College Street, that the amount of funding—they get the largest in Ontario—per victim has gone down dramatically over the last 20 years. It hasn’t gone up, it hasn’t stayed stable; it has gone down. These are predominantly volunteers who go out with police on calls, who do the mediation work to anything that involves violence against women and presumably get called for calls like this as well. That’s sad, because we need to be funding our front-line agencies so they can do the necessary work.", "The member also mentioned shelter supports. It’s so hard for young women to find shelter room in this province, in this city. It’s difficult. There are very few shelters for women, and there are very few shelters where young girls would be safe at all. Again, it’s a huge and gaping need.", "The larger issue, of course, of equality for women also looms behind this issue, because you know that where you have economic opportunities for older girls, where you have equal pay for equal work, where you have access to services—all of that plays into this and makes all women more vulnerable, and particularly young women more vulnerable.", "So, again, I just want to say thank you. It’s wonderful when a member brings passion into this place around any issue, but particularly an issue where there is such a glaring need, and just will not give up. You always know, when that happens—you see it; it’s rare, but you see it—that they will get results. Of course, we never know when, but I hope that you get results.", "So thank you again for bringing this forward. Thank you for educating all of us.

Yes, we looked at the Manitoba work, and I, along with a number of other ministers, announced a province-wide strategy to end human trafficking: a commitment of up to $72 million over four years. It actually involves a dozen different government ministries. That’s the kind of comprehensive commitment that is required to end this violence. We need to help our most vulnerable people in our society who are at the most risk of being trafficked.", "We know how horrible this is, and we know, as the member from Parkdale–High Park spoke, about how these relationships often start for young, vulnerable people and how trauma bonds are formed with traffickers. It’s a devastating crime.", "I just want to mention briefly what work is under way. I spoke about this in question period this morning, but I want to highlight this again.

We’re expanding that program, and new protocols are being developed between children’s aid societies and the police.", "Our Ministry of Labour plays a unique role in combatting human trafficking.

Today is such an occasion.", "It’s an honour to add my voice to the chorus of those calling on government to move past empty words and on to real, definitive action to combat the scourge of human trafficking, as proposed by my colleague from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock in the Saving the Girl Next Door Act.", "This summer, I had the chance to invite the Haliburton MPP down to Waterloo region, where our NDP colleague from Kitchener–Waterloo and our regional police chief joined us to host a round table on human trafficking and the impacts in our community. The difficult stories shared were compelling, heart-wrenching and called out for a concrete action plan to address human trafficking operations that for far too long have been able to operate and victimize young people right here in our community.", "It was just weeks before the round table that Waterloo residents were shocked to hear details surrounding the arrest of four adults relating to a human trafficking scheme that victimized a 14-year-old Kitchener girl, among many others. She had been taken to two Kitchener hotels to participate in human trafficking offences. As Waterloo Regional Police Chief Bryan Larkin asked the day of the round table, “If every citizen would just pause and think. A 14-year-old. The natural question is ... how do we end up here? How does a 14-year-old end up being trafficked and engaged in sexual acts? How do they end up ingesting meth, a significant hard-core synthetic drug? We should all be concerned about that.”", "The fact is that once people are made aware, we are concerned. We are asking those questions of how a 14-year-old could fall into this trap, and how she and so many others—many younger—could continue to be victimized while society fails to hear their cries for help.", "The problem is that those cries are too often silenced by intimidation and shame, while perpetrators continue to victimize those unprepared or unable to protect themselves. And it’s happening right here in Ontario, in major cities across the province.", "Our province, of course, is home to 65% of the human trafficking cases in the country, and the Highway 401 corridor is the key conduit, providing an accessible thoroughfare for traffickers and the ability to keep victims isolated—victims who are often lured, groomed, manipulated, threatened and exploited for sex as often as 10 to 15 times per day for the trafficker’s financial gain, and victims who are often transported to and through the Kitchener-Waterloo area.", "While victimization has only grown in recent years, support and outreach organizations in my area continue to use their limited resources to provide vital awareness and support. Ms. Timea Eva Nagy, one of the most recognizable champions for trafficking victims in Ontario, has devoted herself to bringing that needed awareness to the fore. A former victim herself, Timea has worked with many in Waterloo region and beyond, founding the Walk With Me organization and publishing a book, Memoirs of a Sex Slave Survivor.", "Thankfully, Timea is not alone. Our round table saw representatives from Women’s Crisis Services of Waterloo Region, Victim Services Waterloo Region, YWCA Kitchener-Waterloo, Distress and Crisis Ontario, and the Sexual Assault Support Centre of Waterloo Region. We were also joined by Sarah Witmer, who aims to have her Restorations charity open a rural home where victims of human trafficking can heal and be fully restored.", "I know that there are many others working to support the victims who are able to escape the clutches of human trafficking. I note that the newest addition to my constituency staff, Meaghan Martin, has worked to put together the Sleep Tight initiative, collecting pyjamas to send a message of comfort and hope while also raising much-needed awareness.", "There’s a lot of good work going on, on many different fronts, but it’s that elusive awareness that continues to be the missing key. We continue to work to create that awareness and step up support efforts.", "That’s why I’ll be supporting the Saving the Girl Next Door Act and its aims to: enable protection orders for victims; expand the Sex Offender Registry to include traffickers; allow victims to sue their traffickers; and proclaim Human Trafficking Awareness Day in Ontario.", "I look forward to seeing members opposite lending their support as well to speak with a united voice on such an important, neglected issue that has, for too long, been allowed to victimize too many." ],

I think that’s something you don’t realize often enough in this place. There are so many issues out there that we may not ever get the time in our tenure to focus on. Despite our partisan differences and affiliations, it is really a gift when another member takes their slot to bring forward such an important issue and to allow us to speak on it. I really commend you, and I thank you on behalf of our caucus as well.", "As I read the bill, two words jump out at me: “practical” and “effective.” “Practical” doesn’t mean that it’s simple in its prescription. In fact, some of it will eventually be complex, especially some of the legal interpretations when it comes to tort law, I see. We’ll be looking forward to seeing some experts at committee. Some of the practical implications—setting aside February 22 of each year as Human Trafficking Awareness Day, which would, according to our colleague, shed much-needed light on the seriousness and severity of human trafficking in Ontario. Of course, we should have a day to inform our communities, to dedicate to having this discussion. It’s something, even if it comes across the ticker on the morning news, where it reminds us that, “Today members of the Legislature will be acknowledging human trafficking day.” We can sit down with our daughters and our sons around the breakfast table and explain to them what human trafficking is and that it actually exists in our communities and in our province.", "I think I’ve heard from the minister of women’s issues—let me get that right; yes, the minister responsible for women’s issues—and I thank her for her submission and highlighting some of the work that the government has done.", "I too had the honour of sitting on the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment. I learned a lot from our colleague from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock as she was able to put a lens on everything we heard around that committee, reminding us that this exists and that human trafficking should also be a part of the subject, because it was a little bit excluded from the overall focus of the select committee. I know it’s all in the same realm, but for some reason or another—that just highlights the need for us to focus on it because it is so unknown; it flies so under the radar. Maybe it’s because in this province we can’t believe that this could exist. How low of a human being do you have to be? It’s got to be the lowest form, to take advantage of vulnerable children and to use them, essentially, for slavery. It’s unfathomable. That’s maybe why we don’t have these discussions. But it is important that we do and, again, I’m very honoured to be a part of it today.", "But to the minister: I sense that maybe you’re being a little bit protective of your turf in the sense that the government is taking on these initiatives—as you should—as a multi-ministerial approach, crossing various ministers. I think that’s probably good as well. But in my mind, I’m thinking, as I’m listening to you, that there’s no end to this until we stop it. There are no efforts that we can put forward that will be enough until it is completely eradicated. Whether it’s ministerial initiatives, or those that come from opposition members in terms of what else we can do, that can only add to the arsenal that we give our front-line workers in combatting this.", "Our colleague from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock noted the community of Kenora, which has taken this head-on and collaborated, coordinated their efforts, because that might be the epicentre. As we learned on that committee, the select committee, our northern communities are vulnerable in all respects, maybe more so than anywhere else in this province. When you live in a northern community and you don’t have access to clean drinking water, that simple life-sustaining aspect, you are more vulnerable down the chain when it comes to societal issues, in effect. We know that that is where, maybe, we should start and the focus should be there.", "Let’s ensure that we have the proper resources and that you’re given the leeway, through your cabinet colleagues, to ensure that you have the money to put into these initiatives. We hope that it’s enough, but if it isn’t, have the fortitude to listen to other colleagues that you might have to add some more to ensure that it’s eradicated." ],

It seems like just yesterday in some ways. I do know that you are very, very committed on this subject and I want to acknowledge you for a fantastic job done.", "This is a very, very important issue. It’s one that we are all very concerned about. I’m a mother of three girls. I obviously worry about my children, as all mothers worry about their children. But there’s a difference when a baby girl is born. We have different worries about those children, unfortunately.", "I do think, however, that it’s a little bit unfair that the member says that we haven’t done enough. I think that we’ve done quite a bit. We have a provincial strategy, which is called Operation Northern Spotlight. The Kingston city police are taking part in that strategy. I think they have done fantastic work. As the minister of women’s issues has mentioned, we have allocated up to $72 million, and a dozen different government ministries are taking part in that initiative. I think that that really does speak to how committed we are.", "We understand that it’s a very complicated issue. We understand that there is no simple, quick fix. All of the changes that are being made and that are proposed in Bill 17 are excellent, but we think that they need to go a little bit farther. Our strategy is a lot broader than creating a task force or the legislative changes proposed in Bill 17.", "As I mentioned, the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment launched Ontario’s Strategy to End Human Trafficking, a response to several different recommendations which were made by the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment. It is going to include multi-year investments, stronger collaboration, a coordination of services and supports, and information and knowledge sharing across sectors and jurisdictions to improve those outcomes for survivors. That just speaks to the dozen different ministries that are involved.", "We know that it is a very encompassing and complicated issue. I’m very pleased to speak to it.

The signs that someone is being trafficked are not always recognized.", "Anecdotally, my constituency office in Sarnia assisted the mother of a young woman last winter in a situation where the mother believed that her adult daughter was caught in this vicious cycle of drug abuse and human trafficking. I want to commend my staff and the local community support agencies for helping to find this young woman assistance and the opportunity to try and break free from the violent, coercive grasp of traffickers.

Provisions in the bill, the Saving the Girl Next Door Act, will assist authorities by giving them the tools they need to go after traffickers. This is something that is needed and should be enacted immediately by the government.", "Again, I want to thank our member from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock and all of the members in the Legislature who have worked on this. I certainly want to see this bill passed.", "I’ve spoken on this bill before, and I’m going to say it again to the people out there that are watching this: There are people working in the hotel and entertainment business, in the taxi and that type of industry, where they’re actually moving people between point A and point B, whether it’s along the 401 or in these hotels and places like that.

I have a prop that I can’t show you, but I found it very prominently displayed on the inside door of a washroom cubicle. It says, “You see a girl who could do anything.

She knew exactly what he was trying to do, but she didn’t think to mention it to me because I would have called up that Shoppers right away and warned them of what was going on on their premises.

The day is known as the Albanian Liberation Day. The Albanian Canadian community celebrates these dates in Ontario by raising the flag here at Queen’s Park, as well as organizing cultural events, banquet dinners and many, many different forms of celebrations throughout the country.", "Mr. Speaker, we ask ourselves, who are some of the most prominent Albanians that we know? The list is long, and I’ll detail a few, but I would also like to mention that we are fully cognizant and we are also exploiting to the fullest the fact that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, the Honourable Laura Albanese—you may be interested to know, Speaker, that the word Albanese in Italiano—in Italian—actually means Albanian, so she’s officially Laura “the Albanian.”", "Speaker, as you know, Mother Teresa was proclaimed a Roman Catholic saint some months ago. Her family is originally from Kosovo; born in Macedonia, but of course with the objective of becoming a missionary, migrated at the age of 18, to learn English, to the Sisters of Loreto; and she made the eventual journey to India, where we are all of course very familiar with her lifelong dedication to the poor and the sick and the infirm, I believe, in the city of Calcutta. She won the Nobel prize in 1979. So she’s an extraordinary symbol of Albanian heroism and multi-faith identity.", "Members of this House, those who are historically inclined, may be interested to know about Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg, a 15th-century national hero who unified the Albanian nation in its resistance against the imperial rule.", "Of course, a famous writer, who I think shares a namesake with me, Ismail Kadare, a world-renowned writer who, by the way, won the Man Booker prize in 2005 for a long contribution of historical novels, political satire and so on.", "We know, for example, Jim and John Belushi, the American Albanian actors and comedians; Rita Ora and Dua Lipa, internationally known singers; and last but not least, a couple of people: Tie Domi, of the NHL; and Inva Mula, an internationally recognized soprano.", "Speaker, if you’ll allow me, I’d also like to take a few moments to share with this Legislature a short historical background of the Albanian nation and the resilient Albanian Canadian community right here in Ontario. As many of you know, Albania is a country in southeast Europe, bordered by Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia and Greece. It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea, located east of Italy, and the Ionian Sea to the southwest, just above Greece. With abundance of natural beauty, nearly 500 kilometres of coastline abutting expanses of rugged mountains, Albania, which has endured centuries of foreign rule and a brief but impactful Italian rule, is a mélange of old- and new-world influences.", "Today, Albania is a member of NATO and has received the status of an official candidate for accession to the European Union. However, the country and its people have had a long history far exceeding that. The Albanian Canadian community, and of course, our esteemed guests who have joined us here represent the different parts of southeast Europe, where Albanians have inhabited countries for centuries, including Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Greece.", "As the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has shared previously, Italy has a historic Albanian minority to this day of approximately a quarter of a million, scattered mostly across southern Italy. The historical Albanian community in Italy are known as the Arbëreshë. They settled in Italy in the 15th and 16th centuries, displaced by changes of imperial boundaries in southeast Europe. The Arbëreshë are known to have preserved their authentic language, religion, traditions, customs and art.", "I know the Albanian community here will be welcoming a number of Arbëreshë community members during next month’s—November 3, by the way, Speaker—Albanian heritage festivities, hosted by the Liberal caucus and my colleagues. The Albanian diaspora exists globally, but in particular in countries such as Canada, Turkey, the United States and western Europe.", "I would also like to note and share with this House some background on the character and national identity of our esteemed community members from Albania. Studies in anthropology show that Albanians share the same ancestry as most other European peoples. In fact, Albanians are very ancient people, descendants of the ancient Illyrians, and you can catch some Shakespeare references in there too, Speaker.", "During most of their troubled history, Albanians have been conquered and ruled by three major empires: Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman. These long occupations brought significant anthropological and social changes, most importantly, of course, with the introduction of three major religions: Catholicism, Orthodox, as well as Islam. The Albanian nation is comprised of mainly Islamic, Catholic and Orthodox Christian faiths, with small pockets of evangelical and Jewish faiths. However, the Albanian national identity, which transcends all of these, has remained resilient throughout the centuries. Speaker, all you have to do is meet a few Albanian Canadian community members, whether it’s the ambassador to Dr. Kondaj to young kids, just to see how proud they are, as we are of you, in maintaining your national heritage, culture and identity.", "The community, for example, here in Ontario, has held on to its traditional customs, songs, dances, instruments, stories, legends, oral histories and literature, also dear to you and to us together. They have held on to what’s known as the code of Besa, a collection of principles which regulated Albanian social, economic and religious order, together with traditional customs and cultural practices of Albanian society—not for 10 years, not even for a century, but for centuries.", "Besa suggests being faithful, keeping a promise and keeping your word of honour. Besa has also the meaning of being hospitable, taking care of guests, travellers and those in need. As an example, during World War II, Albanians in Europe sheltered more than several thousand Jewish people from Nazi persecution and, of course, sacrificed locally for that very extraordinary effort.", "And now, about our Canadian Albanians: According to our latest statistics, Albanian Canadians make up on the order of about 30,000 people and counting here in Canada, mostly around the GTA, in Ontario. The first wave of Albanian immigration occurred in the early 20th century, mainly as a result of the uprisings and dislocations in southeast Europe, post-World War I. The second wave of Albanians arrived following World War II, escaping Communist-run Albania and the former Yugoslavia.", "However, the third and biggest wave of immigration occurred as a result of the collapse of the Communist dictatorship in Albania in 1991 and the 1990s ethnic conflict that led to the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.", "A troubled, challenged but deeply proud and deeply esteemed community: We salute you for maintaining your heritage and culture after all the changes of governments and dictatorships and rulers and empire to this very day.", "The government of Canada, Speaker, as you may know, established a residency program to accept 7,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees fleeing the Kosovo conflict in 1998 and 1999.", "Today, the majority of Albanian Canadians reside here in our great centres—the GTA, Hamilton, Kitchener, London, Ottawa, Peterborough and Windsor—and nowadays members of the community can count on several community associations for support and networking opportunities within our system here.", "Within our publicly funded school system, there are a number of different elementary schools. As you know, Premier Wynne, our entire caucus and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration deeply respect and support multicultural Canadians. As an example of that, we actually offer the teaching of the Albanian language in elementary schools here in the province of Ontario.", "One unifying organization within the community—and I salute its director and president and executive lead—is the Albanian Canadian Community Association of Toronto, led, as I said quite earlier, by Dr. Ruki Kondaj. It has been active since its establishment in 1989 and the association is developing a greater awareness and pride among its members within the entire Canadian community.", "Albanian Canadians, as we are, should also be proud of their centuries-old contribution, not only to the world, but particularly now here in the province of Ontario. I would, with respect to Hansard, like to say now that we thank you for maintaining all this heritage and culture, and in Albanian:", "Thank you, Speaker." ],

I appreciate the leadership shown by Ms. Albanese to recognize you and give us the opportunity to recognize you in a more formal way, not only as a group, but also the contribution and the culture you bring, in a manner similar to the rest of us.", "Whether we came two months ago or 200 years ago, there’s a certain theme that goes through all of those people, like you, who have come to Canada. I think that perhaps one of the motives, kind of stepping into what I think you might be thinking, is the opportunity to bring the best of what you have and do the best with what you get when you come to Canada. To be able to do that means that all of us are able to hold in one hand the ideas and values of our families, but also to be able to move along and recognize the opportunity to live with people of other persuasions and other cultures. It’s very much in keeping that we should be able to spend this brief time today and, as a result, the outcome that we all expect, of course, is that there will be a heritage month.", "Much of what I had thought I might comment on has been mentioned, but the fact that the Albanians have come to Canada, pushed by the war and struggle and disruption in their own country—as I said a moment ago, many of us could say the same thing. After World War II, the country of Albania then was under a Communist regime, and we all know that travel would not have been permitted in a normal way.", "In 1986, there were fewer than 1,500 Albanian Canadians. It’s really interesting to see that the current number is 30,000. It gives some recognition to the opportunities that were provided to allow you to make the decision to come to Canada. That, of course, came as a result of the upheaval and instability in that part of Europe, which then promoted people fleeing from the area in order to come to Canada.", "Shortly thereafter, in the early 2000s, there was a new war which sparked a second wave of immigration of Albanians to Canada. As I say, coming here has provided you with the security and stability of community life and the opportunity for a better future for your children—the opportunity that it provides for all of us.", "As time has passed, Albanian Canadians have created community organizations to maintain their culture and to help new Albanian immigrants adjust to life here in Canada. One of the things that struck me which really speaks to that motive and that ability to turn ideas into action is the Albanian Canadian Excellence society, which has an annual set of ACE Awards that they give to Albanian Canadians celebrating success in business, the arts and entrepreneurship. While the most recent set of awards has not yet been released, they have announced the nominees. It’s certainly something that I’m sure everyone will look forward to. Nominees include Edor Kabashi, who has made discoveries in health research surrounding ALS; and Blerina Hoxha, who works for Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment and volunteers by building schools in Jamaica.", "They also give an award to a non-Albanian. One such nominee is Robert Austin, a professor at the University of Toronto with the Munk School of Global Affairs, who has dedicated much of his career to studying Albania and Kosovo. Another is Eliott Behar, who has worked as a crown prosecutor. In 2008, he became a war crimes prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.", "We can just get a glimpse here of the kind of breadth of community that you reflect, and we wish you the best of all that we have to offer. I know that you will be able to continue to contribute to Canada as a strong democracy with a strong tradition of immigration, helping people build our country. It’s my pleasure to support the bill." ],

I genuinely believe bills like these are wonderful opportunities that allow us to celebrate, but also provide us with unique learning opportunities. By learning about other cultures, we promote harmony and history, all of which makes us an inclusive province.", "We know that Ontario is home to approximately 40,000 Albanians, with another 20,000 throughout Canada, and that Toronto is home to the largest Albanian population in our country.", "Canada’s relationship with Albania has evolved over the past few years. By moving past the historical context, where Albania was a formerly closed and centrally planned state, they have taken important yet challenging steps towards becoming a more modestly democratic country. It is our intention to celebrate the emerging democracy in Albania, while promoting and celebrating Albanians in Ontario right now.", "The effort of culture sharing as diverse as Albania is indeed a challenging task. Many Ontarians are unaware that Albanian Canadians come from a variety of European countries.", "As an ancient people, Albanians are descendants of the ancient Illyrians, being conquered and ruled by three vast empires throughout most of their history. The Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires, through their long occupation of Albania, introduced significant religious influences including Catholicism, Orthodox and Islam. Yet their powerful connection to their lands and language never faltered and helped to ensure the Albanian national identity remained strong and true. We are eager to help celebrate and embrace that identity here in Ontario.", "By once again looking to the past, we can see that the month of November is truly significant for the Albanian community. On November 28, 1912, the Albanian people attained their independence as a sovereign nation and so commemorated the celebration of their declaration of independence.", "Another important milestone celebrating Albania’s rich heritage is Albanian Liberation Day. This is a day that recognizes the importance of resistance—resistance in the face of true evil that had risen to power, for November 29, 1944 is the day that Albanian forces stood their ground against Nazi Germany and defied their occupation.", "These days, recognized here at Queen’s Park through flag-raising ceremonies and other receptions and events, reinforce the reasons for naming November as Albanian Heritage Month.", "This history of Albanian immigration to Canada began at the start of the 20th century, following internal pre-war revolutionary upheavals. Few emigrated to Canada after World War II, following the establishment of the Communist regime, which banned Albanians from travelling abroad. The huge wave of migrants came after the collapse of the Communist regime in the early 1990s. Despite this migration, by 1986, the number of Albanians was recorded at just under 1,500. However, in 1991, these figures nearly doubled. The number of Albanians in Canada peaked in the late 1990s as they fled economic and political crisis in both Albania and Yugoslavia.", "At the beginning of the 21st century, the armed conflict between Albania and the Serbian military and police caused many Albanians to feel compelled to leave Kosovo as refugees. As refugees, many Albanians began emigrating to Canada. Thus, in 1999, the government of Canada established a residency program to allow 7,000 refugee Kosovar Albanians.", "As mentioned previously, Albanians do not come only from Albania and Kosovo, they come from at least five different countries: Macedonia, Greece, Italy, Serbia and Montenegro. This diversity has ensured that over the years, Albanian Canadians established many organizations in Canada to maintain their language, traditions and culture.", "I would like to recognize the dedication and hard work of the Albanian groups and organizations here in Ontario undertaking that work. These associations have also helped other immigrants adapt to Canadian life. Many of these partnerships are in Toronto. In this city, the largest associations are the Albanian Muslim Society of Toronto, founded in 1954, and the Albanian Canadian Community Association of Toronto, founded in 1990. There are other notable organizations, such as the Albanian-Canadian Organization of Ottawa. Again, I want to thank them for their efforts on behalf of the people of Ontario.", "There are so many opportunities to learn from our Albanian Canadians. I for one am looking forward to discovering more about the rich culture, literacy and artistic contributions they have made and I welcome everyone to do so. Thank you, Speaker, for the opportunity to talk on Albanian Heritage Month." ],

You look like you’re Albanian.” I said, “Maybe I do kind of look like I’m Albanian”—and maybe that’s why when I met Ruki Kondaj, the honorary president of the Albanian Canadian Community Association, she embraced me so closely when we met.", "We became very good friends. It was really outside of politics that we became very good friends. Eventually, she invited me to some of her Albanian functions. Then they saw me dance with them, and I’m surprised they didn’t kick me right out and say, “There’s no way you should be involved with the Albanian community,” because believe me, Albanians can dance; I really can’t. So I don’t know how I fit in, but I tried. Maybe they gave me credit for that.", "If you ever hear Albanians sing—I don’t know if there’s an Albanian who doesn’t have a good voice, but I haven’t met one yet. When you go to Albanian functions, there are kids that come up; there are entertainers, there are musicians. Their ability to sing and act, the love for the culture—and we have some of the participants here with us today—it’s just mind-boggling.", "In some ways, I kind of embraced the Albanian community, and for some reason, they kind of embraced me. Ever since, I’ve been involved with them in a number of different things. I just want to say today, in the short time that I’m speaking, thank you to the Albanian community for the love and affection you’ve given me through the years, and thank you for all you’ve done for this province. You really are a shining example of what a culture can contribute to Ontario life and Canadian life and how you do it through your song, dance, food, the joy you bring and the sharing of your experiences. I think the member for Etobicoke North spoke very eloquently about the experience through history of the Albanian community. We learned so much from you.", "I can’t help, as Minister of Economic Development, but to also say, for all of the great Albanian business people, that we have a fantastic business community that’s done great things in Ontario.", "So congratulations to our Albanian community here in Ontario for all of the great things you’ve achieved here and continue to achieve. Thank you all so very much for your support for the Albanian community.

It’s kind of fun to have all our visitors from the Albanian cultural and political communities come down and hear us talk again, because the first time we did it, we learned a little bit, and now we’re learning a little bit more.", "A lot of times we do learn from all of the cultural outreach we do. Today, it was a celebration of the 56th anniversary of the independence of the country of Cyprus. They did a flag-raising earlier today and had a very nice reception. There are little tidbits that you learn, such as that the root word of “Cyprus” is from the colour copper, because they used to mine copper there. Those kinds of things we really enjoy learning.", "I want to really thank a friend of mine who’s here with his mom: Ariel Ora, and his mother is Dhurata Sahatcija. I always have to practise how to say “Sahatcija,” so I hope I’m saying it correctly. They’re here today. Ariel has taken it upon himself to teach me about Albanian history and Albanian culture a little bit. I want to really thank him for that.", "One of the things he taught me is that Albania is known as Shqipëri, which is “the land of the eagles,” and the Albanians sort of nicknamed themselves Shqipëtar, or “the sons of eagles.” They identified with this noble symbol very early on and it is proudly displayed on their flag. That’s why I’m mentioning that Cyprus has the colour copper on their flag.", "These are the kinds of things about which we realize we have so much in common, all the different communities. Yes, we have differences—different types of food and dance and music, and even our traditional costumes and things like that—but the more you learn from all the different communities, the more you learn how similar they are. One of the things that I’ve learned is that Albania, even though it’s one of the smallest countries in Europe, has incredible landscapes. I’d really like to go and visit someday. That’s what really draws us in and makes us want to learn and want to visit.", "It’s really a country known for very courageous people. We heard some of the history and the difficult times that they’ve been through in terms of being conquered by different empires throughout their history. But the character of Albanians is marked by tolerance and hospitality, and I want to mention, as the representative for the Jewish community here in Ontario, that Albania was the only country, after the Second World War, that had a greater number of Jews than it had before the war. That was because of the character of the Albanians, who protected their Jewish citizens. On behalf of the Jewish community, I want to thank the Albanian community.", "It was mentioned already that Mother Teresa hailed from Albania. She’s probably their most well-known celebrity, I guess, and she has now been canonized. She’s Saint Teresa now.", "What Ariel also taught me is, in terms of literary personalities, the name Ismail Kadare." ],

A lot of his novels, I think, were set in Albania, specifically where he grew up. But he ran into problems with the regime, and he fled to France, where he lived in exile for a time.", "He was given a doctor honoris causa at the University of Palermo.", "He noted that, “Of all the languages of the Balkan peninsula, Albanian was the only one whose writing was banned under the Ottomans.” Basically, they had to hide the fact that they were writing. They hid it in texts so that Ottoman soldiers thought it was actually Latin.", "That kind of reminded me of ancient stories of the Jews living in Babylonian times, where they played games when they wanted to teach the Torah to children. The Roman soldiers would walk by and think they were just playing backgammon and other kinds of games, but actually, they were teaching the children. Or they would go in the forest and pretend that they were camping and doing hiking, but while they were doing that, they were actually teaching the children.", "I think that we all know that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Unfortunately, a lot of communities that have that inner strength to pass on, from generation to generation, their traditions, their language, their songs and all their art—sometimes they get that drive from the difficult times—not that I wish harsh, difficult times on anybody, but I think that you either lie down and die or you rise up and you get stronger.

I’ve shared this story with most of you before, but I’ll share it again for the record and for the members of the Legislature. I grew up in a family where my grandparents immigrated to Canada from eastern Europe. They were not of Albanian heritage. I actually don’t know what my surname means in Albanian or in Italian. They came from eastern Europe and they were very proud of their heritage, as you are proud of yours.", "My grandfather in particular was proud of his heritage and he wanted to make sure that I learned about my heritage.

You can imagine this wasn’t something that I really wanted to be doing on a Saturday afternoon, but I did. One day I was particularly frustrated, struggling with the work, and said, “Gido”—I called him Gido at the time—“I don’t want to do this anymore. I want to stop.” And he said, “You cannot stop, and I’ll tell you why. First of all, it’s important to me that you learn about your history and your heritage and your culture. As you get older, as you learn more, you will appreciate it more. But,” he said, “I also want you to learn these things because I want you to learn about the people who made this country great”—made Canada great—“the people who came before you and built this great country.”", "That, to me, is what this bill is about.

In fact, you are adding to the beauty of Canada. You being here makes Canada what it is. I think that’s an important thing to note.", "Another thing is—and I notice this with many different communities—we sometimes feel like we are guests in Canada.

You can complain about it. You can build it stronger. It is your home.", "I think all communities from diverse backgrounds sometimes feel like they’re guests, and I want to rid them of that mentality. No one is a guest here. Everyone has a home here. This is your home.", "I also really want to take some time to talk about the beauty of Albania itself and its diversity. I find that wherever you see diversity, you see a lot of beauty. The land of Albania itself is diverse. There are mountainous regions and there are beautiful coastal regions. In fact—something that has been mentioned by a previous member—tourism is one of the major drivers of the economy in Albania because it’s so beautiful. It’s kind of a hidden gem. Numerous websites that talk about travel have listed Albania as a must-visit. So I must visit Albania one day, hopefully, so I look forward to that.", "Something else that really struck me as an important part of the Albanian identity is the fact that throughout the struggles, if you see the history of Albania, there is a strong theme of resilience. The community is very resilient. Despite difficulties, despite obstacles, the community has really flourished, and it speaks to the identity of the Albanian people. I think that’s why the land of eagles is such an appropriate term because the eagle soars above. No matter what happens, the eagle continues to soar. That’s the spirit of Albanians: They soar above all the obstacles, all the difficulties, and continue to prosper. That’s something that truly inspires me.", "The choice of November as a date is very powerful, given the Albanian declaration of independence and particularly the liberation day, which celebrates the resistance, which is again that spirit of rising against the obstacles, that spirit of resistance that the Albanian people have. I think that’s very powerful.", "I want to finish, with my last minute, by talking about the culture of Albanian people. A culture is rich in a number of areas and the Albanian people provide richness in all those. The food has, again, that diversity where you’ve combined the cultures of different areas and brought them together to create the best of all the region. You have delicious desserts and seafood—even though I’m a vegetarian, I acknowledge that it’s amazing. All the cuisine is phenomenal.", "The language is also a very rich language that’s been built up from diversity from different areas. The music and dance—I really want to talk about this just very briefly. I read a bit about the dance. There was the heroic tones from the north and the subtle, relaxed sounds of the south, the dance, the cultural costumes—the culture is beautiful and strong, and I salute the community for keeping it strong and maintaining that heritage here in Canada. Your identity makes you who you are, and I wish we could all learn from the power of this small but mighty nation that celebrates their identity so powerfully." ],

The guest, in an Albanian’s life, represents the supreme ethical category, more important than blood relations.” This particular quotation speaks to the spirit of inclusivity, celebration, protection, generosity, compassion and humanity. That, Speaker—as we are appreciating formally today with this bill, if passed, with November being Albanian Heritage Month—is in fact the spirit of the Albanian people worldwide.", "Thank you, Speaker. Falemenderit." ],

Everyone knew Joseph, admired Joseph and felt a warmth of friendship towards him.", "Joseph came to Canada from Hong Kong as a teenager. Like a number of us in this chamber, Joseph lived the most Canadian experience—that of an immigrant—and he had made the best of it.", "It was clear that Joseph found great pride and honour to serve in this building. This was felt in the way that he befriended each and every member who entered the dining room. Joseph had a way of making us feel, every time, that we were being greeted by a lifelong friend. He always remembered how you took your coffee and the last time he had seen you. He was just as kind in nature and courteous with everyone, whether they were a visitor, a staff member, an MPP or a minister. Joseph was a true gentleman. I am certain that great warmth and friendship is reflected in all of our memories of Joseph.", "These past few days, as I spoke to some of my colleagues, the conversation more than once turned to reflecting on Joseph. The more people I spoke to, the more I realized how Joseph had impacted the experience of so many who serve at Queen’s Park. Joseph always remembered everyone’s name, and we just as certainly knew his.", "Hundreds of people work so diligently, Mr. Speaker, to keep the institution of the Legislature running every single day. Joseph stood out among them. Of all the staff at Queen’s Park who support and serve the members of the Legislative Assembly, Joseph truly shone. That is a gift of humanity, an example of the generous and kind nature of human existence. In this very busy, very hectic, very partisan institution, he served to remind us of the humanity that lies within all of us, and the importance of never forgetting someone’s name and giving them a smile or a warm greeting.", "This wonderful man had such an impact on our lives. We feel a sense of loss and a hole in this building, but the greatest loss is felt by his family. On behalf of the Premier, my colleagues and every member of this House, I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Carol; his daughters, Aeolia, Martina and Amaranta; and all of his family and friends.

We found that we had something in common: beer and enjoying good conversation. I was not an intimate or long-time friend of Joseph, and I know little of his earlier life, other than that he arrived here in Ontario nearly 40 years ago from Hong Kong at the age of 18.", "Although there is much of Joseph’s life that I do not know, I wanted to take a few moments to share with everyone those qualities and traits that I do know. What struck me most about Joseph, since he first served that beer to me, and was immediately obvious to anyone, was his happiness. Each and every time, and without fail, when I saw Joseph, he was always happy. His eyes were always shining and gleaming. He was never without a smile and a face full of enjoyment and an upbeat greeting. Whether in the dining room or at an evening reception or meeting him in the lobby while leaving the building on his way home, you would always find the most friendly, happy greeting that was infectious, everlasting and genuine.", "Joseph served me many beers over the last seven years. In our world of politics and in our habitat of partisanship, where it’s theatrics that keep our world turning, Joseph was a most memorable individual, full of those most endearing and genuine qualities of honesty, friendliness and happiness. Although Joseph did not hold elected office, he embodied those qualities that we all find honourable.", "Once again, on behalf of the entire Progressive Conservative caucus, we shall all dearly miss our honourable and happy friend Joseph Ng." ],

We knew Joseph was sick. He had come to work a number of times looking not well, looking weaker and thinner, even though he was a wiry and thin guy to begin with. We saw as his disease—a disease that touches pretty much everybody in Ontario and in Canada, that devastating disease of cancer—started to eat away at him. We saw that he was gone for a little while from the dining room as he was receiving treatments. We were thrilled to welcome him back when he came back, having gained enough strength to once again come to work. As you know, Joseph was a working guy. He was somebody who needed to work to be able to pay the bills and put a roof over his head and the heads of his family. He was a stand-up guy in that regard.", "One of the things that I found interesting about Joseph was that, notwithstanding the fact that he did remember if you took coffee or tea or sugar or no sugar—he would say to me, “No carbs today again, I guess,” and I would say, “No carbs, Joseph. Whatever you can get me in the line of a salad would be great.” So he did remember things about the people that he provided such diligent service to.", "One of the things that I always enjoyed about Joseph was that he was quite a conversationalist. Joseph could engage you in a discussion about politics on any level. He got what was going on. He got what was going on here. He was always careful: He was never partisan. But he certainly paid attention to what was happening here in this Legislature, what was happening in Canadian politics and what was happening in world politics, as a matter of fact. He was a very astute person and was always very engaging if you took the time to have a discussion with him about important issues that face our province, our country and our world.", "The other thing about Joseph is that he had a pretty wicked sense of humour. I don’t know how many people experienced that, but I can tell you that more than once I was in tears laughing at something that Joseph said. He had a very quick wit. He was quite interested in all things going on around us and was very able to turn a quick phrase or to make a very astute comment that often was quite humorous. He was a very funny, funny person.", "As was mentioned, he had a sparkle in his eye. I think that’s because often in his mind, he was thinking about a whole bunch of things that he just wasn’t going to say out loud. But for sure, he had a great sense of humour.", "He was also, at the same time, a very quiet and humble person. I think that’s what led to so much of the respect that he had gained in his life from the members and their guests as he went through his work at the Legislature.", "I’ve heard that Joseph was a singer. I never heard Joseph sing. I heard him tell jokes, I heard him tell stories, and I bantered with him on political issues. I never heard him sing. I can remember being in the dining room a couple of times later on in the afternoon having a quick meeting with someone while they were cleaning up and tidying up the aftermath of the lunch rush, and I can remember there being jazz music on the radio. As I think of Richard over the next—or rather of Joseph; I keep thinking of Richard and Joseph. They were two peas in a pod the whole time. As I think of Joseph over the next while, when he comes to my mind, I’ll be thinking of him singing some Frank Sinatra tune as he cleans up the tables in the dining room downstairs.", "To all the family and friends and associates of Joseph Ng, on behalf of New Democrats, our sincerest condolences.

Before I start, let me tell you that I’ll be sharing my time with my parliamentary assistant, the wonderful member from Barrie.", "It’s a pleasure to rise today, and I’m really happy to rise for second reading of Bill 18. The proposed legislation we’re putting before the House today is both timely and necessary. Ontario has introduced the Stronger Workplaces for a Stronger Economy Act to protect our province’s most vulnerable workers and to increase fairness for both employees and for businesses.", "In a lot of ways, the introduction of this bill for second reading is the story of Ontario. It’s the story of people who come to this country and begin new lives. Often, they’re the people in our society who are viewed as being the most vulnerable, the people who are starting out in life, the people who are starting out in work life in Canada who may not understand the rules, the rights or the responsibilities they have in their new home.", "What we’re doing today is, we’re taking action that’s going to provide a more consistent, a more transparent and a more fair approach to such things as setting Ontario’s minimum wage. In this bill, we propose legislation that will index future minimum wage adjustments to Ontario’s consumer price index. This approach has been supported to date by both employees and employers in the province of Ontario, and is based on the recommendations of an independent advisory panel that was established.", "The Minimum Wage Advisory Panel was established in July 2013 as part of a commitment we made in the 2013 budget that was composed of employer and labour representatives, community representatives, anti-poverty groups, and students. The panel’s report was based on extensive research. It was based on feedback that came in from over 400 Ontarians.", "What it did was it recommended that the minimum wage be revised annually and that, going forward, it be linked to the consumer price index. In speaking to the requests of business, it was asked that at least four months’ notice be given of these changes and that a five-year full review be conducted with a panel of stakeholders and an independent chair at a point in the future. Our government accepted these recommendations and is now moving ahead with them.", "Under our proposals, the first CPI adjustment would take effect on October 1, 2015, with notice to be given to the public at least six months before that. It’s important to remember that when the Liberals first came to office in 2003, we came into office with a minimum wage that had been frozen for eight years in a row. That was not fair to workers, who saw cost-of-living increases while their wages stayed frozen for that period of time.", "That’s why our government, over the years, has increased the minimum wage from the $6.85 we inherited to the $11 that it is today. We increased it during good times, but we also increased it during the depths of the recession because we thought it was the right thing to do and what hard-working families deserved.", "However, in the past, increases to minimum wages have been made on a very ad hoc basis. They’re subject to the political process of this place, and we feel, on this side of the House, that that’s not fair to workers. They didn’t know what their hourly wage would be from one year to the next. It was unpredictable for businesses that couldn’t plan for the future and it was really based on the political whims of the party that formed the government at that particular point in time. That’s why this government has introduced this legislation to remedy that and to index the minimum wage as we move forward.", "This bill, if it is passed, will also have another effect, though. It will level the playing field for employers who play by the rules and who obey the laws we have here in the province of Ontario. By acting to strengthen workplace protection for the most vulnerable and increasing fairness provisions for employees and businesses, we’re helping to build a stronger workplace, and that, in turn, builds a stronger economy, and that certainly, in turn, builds a stronger province here in Ontario.", "This proposed legislation is part of the overall plan we have and a commitment that this government has to lead from the activist centre. It’s consistent with our strategy that we’ve announced to reduce poverty in the province of Ontario.", "Our government fully recognizes that the nature of work in the province of Ontario, in our country and throughout the globe is changing and that the rules we have in place to govern those workplaces have to keep up as well. Employees may have a difficult time establishing themselves financially, which has a negative impact on the economic growth we all want for this province. That speaks to those people who are just establishing themselves in the province of Ontario.", "It’s also a key factor in poverty and those who find themselves living in near poverty. Historically, a significant portion of vulnerable workers has been recent immigrants. They’ve been women, they’ve been young workers and they’ve been those individuals who come from minority ethnic groups. These individuals often find themselves starting their work life in Ontario or in Canada in precarious jobs.", "I’m standing here today speaking to the second reading of Bill 18, but I want to thank those people who have helped form this bill: those people who have provided input; those people who have provided their expertise.", "I want to particularly thank the United Way, McMaster University and the Law Commission of Ontario, who helped lead a dialogue around these very important issues and put some very important issues on the table. But they also put forward many thoughtful solutions which are reflected in the bill. It shows that, out of positive conversations and constructive recommendations, you can get real, meaningful action that can protect people in the province of Ontario. It shows that we have a government—and, I believe, a Legislature—that both listens and acts. It demonstrates that through well-intended engagement with people who may have a variety of opinions on issues we can make progress, and that we can take the steps that are necessary to move forward as a province and to strengthen our economy, while at the same time we address those ever-important issues of social justice.", "Speaker, in drafting this legislation we’ve consulted with 14 other provincial government ministries, as well as the Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. We propose this bill to the House because we believe it’s the right thing to do. It’s the right thing to do for those people in our society who we deem to be vulnerable workers, but it’s also the right thing to do for our business community. It gives us a stronger economy. Bill 18 is an essential part of ensuring that as our province grows financially and socially, it grows the right way. By acting to safeguard workers who need our protection and helping responsible, law-abiding businesses stay competitive, we’re protecting the province in which we live and we’re also working to strengthen our economy.", "These should not be viewed as being mutually exclusive goals—and often they have been in the past. I think we’re saying that these are goals that complement each other, that they’re goals that can travel forward together, that the legislation should be good for business and for those businesses particularly who choose to obey the laws, who are the good guys when we are doing the enforcement.", "We need to support those companies, but we also need to recognize that as people move to our country from other countries, they’re moving into areas where they may not understand that they’ve got certain rights they can avail themselves of. Of Ontario’s many advantages, none is greater than the people who live here and the people who choose to make Ontario their home. Their talent, the skills they bring, their compassion, their competitive nature, their depth and diversity, are an unfailing commitment that we have to one another as citizens of Ontario.", "We’re investing in our people and we’re investing in our province when we increase workplace protections, but we’re also supporting that dynamic business environment that increases fairness for companies in Ontario as well, Speaker. We believe we’ve made progress; we believe we’re going to continue to do so.", "Last year, for example, Ontario was North America’s top destination for foreign direct investment and our economy right here in Ontario added nearly 100,000 jobs. We want to maintain that momentum, and I believe we will maintain that momentum, but at the same time we need to work for fairness and we need to protect those in our society who are employees, who are most vulnerable.", "Our legislative proposals respond to key recommendations in recent reports that most members of this House will be familiar with. They come from our stakeholders. They come from the people we meet on a daily basis. They come from the people who come here to advocate for groups in the province of Ontario. Some of the recommendations that you will find in this bill include eliminating the $10,000 cap on the recovery of unpaid wages and increasing the period of recovery to two years for employees.", "In the past, it was deemed that a cap should be in place as to the amount of money you’d be able to claim from an employer who had chosen not to pay you. We don’t see any justification for that anymore. We believe that in the interest of justice, you should be able to claim what is owed to you. If someone you have worked for in a contract setting, or under any sort of workplace arrangement that you have—if somebody who has told you they will pay you for that work, we need to ensure that that work is indeed paid for.", "We’re going to increase the period of recovery to two years for employees as well. In the past, it was deemed that the time should lapse earlier, the time that you could actually file a claim to get those wages recovered, and I think often you would find people who would go into the process of trying to recover their wages with the best efforts, with a good-faith attitude, thinking that the employer eventually would see the error of their ways and would pay the employee. Often that doesn’t happen. Often time goes by as that wait occurs. What we’re doing here is increasing the amount of time that employees have to make claims against employers who haven’t paid them.", "We’re also doing something that involves client employers and temporary help agencies. In the past, if you worked for a temporary help agency and they sent you out to work for a client employer, if the temporary help agency did not pay you, you had no claim against the place you had actually worked at. What we’re proposing to do in this bill is make client employers who use temporary help agencies liable when agencies don’t pay certain types of wages. What I think will happen as a result of this is that we now are actively encouraging companies to use temporary help agencies that treat their employees fairly, that are going to pay them at the end of the day.", "Extending, as well, Occupational Health and Safety Act coverage to include unpaid co-op students is something that I am particularly pleased to see in this bill. We’re also including other unpaid learners and unpaid trainees in this bill. In the past, when we’ve had co-op students in workplaces, because they haven’t been covered under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, the Ministry of Labour’s involvement in certain cases would have been limited.", "What we’re doing is saying that if you’re part of a training program at a school, a college, a high school, and you go and get some workplace experience, the same protections that every other worker in that workplace enjoys under the Occupational Health and Safety Act should apply to you as well. As a young worker, as a learner, you should have the same rights as the people you’re working along with, learning your trade, your craft, your profession or whatever you are being trained for.", "In the past, Speaker, employers used to be able to recover certain costs—fees, recruitment fees—from people they were placing. We’re saying that that shouldn’t be allowed. What I think every member of this House would agree with, I hope, is that this bill will now make it impossible to seize personal documents, like passports, from all foreign employees, and not just live-in caregivers as it exists today. What we’re proposing to do is extend the application of employment protection for foreign nationals to cover all foreign employees who come to the province of Ontario, whether by immigration or by foreign temporary employee programs.", "Apart from this legislation, but certainly complementary to this legislation, our government has been in the process of boosting the number of enforcement officers in the province, and we’re ensuring that more workplaces are inspected and that more employees are protected. We all know that the world of work is changing, as I said earlier. It’s changing in our province, it’s changing across the country and the continent, and it’s changing around the globe. The number of temporary foreign workers in Ontario, for example, has risen from 91,000 in 2008 to 133,000 in 2013. We believe that Ontarians would agree with us that it’s proper, it’s fair, it’s compassionate that we protect these people, and that now is the time to act.", "Nobody in this province should ever have to surrender their passport or leave their country and come to Ontario because they are promised a job that simply doesn’t exist, and perhaps get charged inappropriate recruitment fees along the way. This is why the proposed legislation that we have before the House today would amend the Employment Protection for Foreign Nationals Act, which applies to live-in caregivers and to others, that was passed in 2009. Our government introduced that bill. It was passed in 2009, and I think that most Ontarians would agree it was the right thing to do.", "What we will do is amend this act to apply to all foreign employees in Ontario who are here, as I said earlier, either through immigration or through foreign temporary employee programs. This means that foreign employees in Ontario would also be protected from illegal recruitment fees, and from having their passports or any other travel documents, or any other documents they may have, withheld by their employers. Under Bill 18, which we have before the House today, the Employment Protection for Foreign Nationals Act would also be extended to cover approximately 110,000 additional temporary foreign employees. This same sense of justice and compassion that led to the original act now leads us to propose extending these safeguards to others who work in Ontario.", "The act, which came into force in March 2010, includes the following protections for foreign live-in caregivers, which under our proposed legislation will now routinely apply to any other foreign employee in this province. It prohibits recruiters from charging any fees at all to the caregiver, and that’s directly or by any surreptitious means indirectly. It prohibits employer recovery of recruitment or placement costs from the caregiver. It prohibits reprisals against foreign live-in caregivers for exercising any one of their rights that are available to them under this act. It requires that information sheets be provided to these employees—information about the rights they have under the act. It also requires employers and recruiters who make a living from this business—and I think this is quite reasonable—to maintain records, that when they’re asked to produce records, those records be available. It prohibits the employer or the recruiter from taking possessions or property, including personal documents, from the employee. It contains no monetary limit on the recovery of monies pursuant to an order of the act, and it provides a 42-month time limit on filing claims under the act as well.", "Extending these protections to most foreign employees in Ontario helps ensure that these workers are treated fairly, regardless of the occupation they’re in, regardless of the skill level they have. It’s only fair because this act sets out minimum standards that all employers and recruiters of foreign employees who are here under an immigration or a foreign temporary employee program will now be aware of, and will now understand very, very clearly that they have to follow.", "Speaker, people in the province of Ontario have a history and a tradition of working very hard. As a result of that, our province, I think, is the envy of the western world as a place to live. When people leave other countries and decide they’re going to settle somewhere else, Ontario is usually near the top of the list as a place that they would like to settle, and that’s for very, very good reasons.", "But they come here with an expectation that we all have—we have it for ourselves; we have it for our parents; we have it for our children and our families; we have it for each other: At the end of your shift, at the end of the day, at the end of the project, you quite simply deserve to be paid for the work you’ve been promised; you quite simply deserve to be paid for the work that you have done. If they are operating a business, they deserve to know that their competitor isn’t undercutting them by not obeying the law or by not paying their employees.", "Unfortunately, right now under the legislation as it exists today, there are both time restrictions and there are monetary limits on the claiming of unpaid wages in the province of Ontario. That simply is not right so we’re making it easier for employees to get the money owed to them by making those limits much more reasonable.", "What we’re proposing to do is to remove the $10,000 cap entirely under the Employment Standards Act, and that is on the recovery of unpaid wages through a Ministry of Labour order to pay those wages that’s being enforced. That means that employees would no longer be forced to pursue larger claims through the courts, saving both employees and businesses time and money, and doing the right thing.", "If passed, our legislation would also increase the time limit for recovery of wages through an order to pay under the Employment Standards Act. It would increase that time limit to two years. We’re proposing this so that older claims can be dealt with fairly, and employees at the end of the process simply get the money that they are owed.", "Everyone recognizes in the province of Ontario that employees should be paid for the work they do. When they are not paid, often those employees come to the Ministry of Labour for help. However, because of changes that were introduced by another party previously, in 1966, employees can only recover up to $10,000 through the ministry. We’re saying that time has passed; that limit is unfair. In fact, what we’re saying is there is no justification for a limit. If you’re owed the money, you’re owed the money. Ontario is the only jurisdiction in Canada that still has such a cap. It’s important that we scrap this unnecessary and punitive measure that was introduced at a different place and time. Even employees who earn minimum wage can have claims above $10,000 if they are also owed termination pay, or perhaps they’re owed severance pay.", "Vulnerable employees often cannot afford to go to court for larger claims. Court proceedings can discourage employers from settling claims quickly, and small businesses should also not have to pay a lawyer, if possible, to resolve these claims. That’s why we’re proposing to remove this cap.", "We’ve been told repeatedly by advocates that many employees need the longer recovery period because they’re afraid to make a claim before they leave their jobs. They’re worried that if they do so, their employer may punish them in some way, and that is simply not right.", "Our proposed legislation would also require employers to provide a free Employment Standards Act information handout to all new employees, explaining their rights under the act. A translation would also have to be provided in a language requested by the employee themselves, if that is available under the many languages that we have available through the Ministry of Labour. These translations were brought into place by the Ministry of Labour to reflect the diverse workforce we have here in the province and to recognize that people come to this province perhaps speaking English well, but perhaps not; perhaps speaking English and another language; or perhaps their language skills are much more proficient in a language other than English. We have done the best we can at the Ministry of Labour to ensure that we have those laws translated into languages where they mean something.", "Our proposed legislation, if passed, will better protect employees who are employed by temporary help agencies. What we’re doing is we’re establishing what is called a joint and several liability provision between the agencies and their clients for failure to pay certain types of wages that may be owed by the agency. This is going to help level the playing field for good employees in this province. Good employees, I think, deserve fairness, and they need protection. Client employers who use temporary help agencies would be liable for regular wages and for overtime pay if the agencies don’t pay up. That simply is the right thing to do. This would help provide employees with better recourse. It would help to encourage clients to work with the more reputable temporary help agencies that we all know exist in the province of Ontario.", "Our government was the first in Canada to introduce legislation specifically addressing temporary help agencies, and that was in 2009. What we did was we made sure that employees were not unfairly prevented from being hired directly at the place they were working by the agency client themselves. Often, they were prevented from doing that—or often, they weren’t actively encouraged to do that. We prohibited agencies from charging fees to workers for such things as interview preparation, resumé writing and some of the other things they were charging fees for at the time that were, upon investigation, deemed to be completely inappropriate. We required those agencies to provide their employees with information about the rights that each and every one of us has, including them, under the Employment Standards Act.", "Speaker, we all know that safe workplaces, when you break it right down, come down to people looking after one another. The Ministry of Labour has been undergoing the largest transformation in the last 30 years. We’re creating a culture that puts health and safety at the centre of every workplace. We’re the first government to appoint a Chief Prevention Officer. His job is to create a health-and-safety/prevention focus in all of our province’s workplaces. This month, we’ve released the proposals that were contained in a government round table that was sponsored by the Ministry of Labour to help address and to begin to deal with an issue that’s very, very important to us, that being work-related traumatic mental stress. Ontario will be hosting a summit early in 2015 specifically on work-related traumatic mental stress, and we’re hoping to attract some of the best and brightest minds in this field to come to the province of Ontario to ensure that Ontario is a leader in this.", "The Ministry of Labour conducts regular enforcement blitzes to help ensure the safety and health of working Ontarians. My ministry recently conducted enforcement blitzes to protect miners in the mining industry in Ontario.", "In September, we issued a progress report—that was very well received both in southern Ontario but certainly in the mining communities in the north and specifically in Sudbury, where it was introduced—of our ongoing mining health and safety review. We didn’t wait to act on that. We’re conducting the review. The review is still ongoing. This was an interim progress report. My understanding is—and from talking to the participants in the group, who come from business and labour and who bring expertise to the table—that simply is something that is just invaluable.", "They asked us to do certain things. They said, “Don’t wait until we’re finished. We’ve got more information for you, but here are some things you can do right now to make mines safer.” What they did was they asked us if we would issue guidelines for high-visibility safety apparel for mines and mining plants.", "Speaker, I went down my first mine about a month ago. I think I was about a mile underground. I think we were at the 5,000-foot level. You really get a sense for the importance of that one recommendation when you’re in a mine. The only light you have is a light that’s coming off your helmet. You’re working in very hot conditions, you’re working in very humid conditions, and you’re working in very industrial conditions. Certainly, the ability to see somebody, I think, is a primary issue that the review committee was very, very quick to adopt. Just the fact that you can see somebody, just the fact that somebody is wearing reflective clothing when you’re in an area or environment like that, is something that, quite simply, I think, is going to prevent injuries and save lives, starting the day it was introduced.", "We’re currently conducting an enforcement blitz that is going to help protect workers who are involved in material handling as well. We’ve also recently conducted an enforcement blitz on construction workers that involves excavation specifically, to help protect these workers as well.", "Our job, and the job of everybody in this House, and certainly my role as the Minister of Labour, is to make sure that workers who go to work at the beginning of the day go home at the end of the day to their families, safe and healthy. That’s what people expect when they go to work. That’s what we all expect: to see that person again, whether it be our mother, our father or any family member who goes to work. We expect to see them again at the end of the shift.", "We believe the expectation of a healthy and safe workplace, though, should also apply to workers in co-op placements or other unpaid learners as well. That’s why, if passed, this bill would also extend coverage of the Occupational Health and Safety Act to unpaid co-op students and to other unpaid trainees and learners, ensuring they have the same individual rights and the same protections as other workers at that workplace. That makes sense, and it’s the right thing to do.", "I’d like to take a few minutes to address another issue related to interns that I know has been of keen interest in recent months. The Ministry of Labour conducted an internship inspection blitz that ran from April 1 of this year to the middle of June.", "Let me be clear right from the start: Unpaid internships are simply illegal in the province of Ontario. Generally, if you perform work for another person or a company or an organization, and you’re not in business for yourself, you’re considered, under the Employment Standards Act, to be an employee. Therefore, under the Employment Standards Act, you’re entitled to the same rights as everybody else. You’re entitled to minimum wage. There are some exceptions, but they’re very, very limited, and the fact that you are called an intern is of no relevance to whether your internship should be paid or unpaid.", "This is about the extension of the Employment Standards Act to all people in the province of Ontario. Quite simply, unless you have an exemption as a secondary school student in co-op work, or you’ve got a credit program, or you’ve got a program to give you work experience that’s approved by a college of applied arts and technology or a university—if you don’t have that exemption, then you need to be paid. The Employment Standards Act applies to you and you need to be paid.", "During our recent enforcement blitz, our employment standards officers visited workplaces in the greater Toronto area in sectors that in the past had been known to employ a high proportion of interns. What these inspectors did specifically was, they looked for contraventions of the Employment Standards Act. What they did in particular when they went in to do the inspections was to check whether there were interns present, unpaid or not, and if so, whether those interns were availing themselves of their rights under the Employment Standards Act. If they were, then they were entitled to be paid. It was that simple.", "I’ll give you some examples of the sectors that we concentrated on because I’ve said in the past, people have said, that internships are used in certain industries much more frequently than they are in others. One was advertising, one was public relations, and computer systems design, consulting services and information services.", "During the blitz, we completed a total of 56 inspections. This is what we found:", "Eight of those employers simply had no internship programs; they hired employees. That’s how they did their business.", "Thirteen of those employers had internship positions, but they were lawfully exempt from the ESA because they were part of a school program. They were part of a college, part of a university; they were part of somebody that was involved in a learning or training experience.", "Five of those employers had internship positions, and they were doing the right thing. They had interns and they were paying them. They had interns and they made sure those interns had every right available to them under the Employment Standards Act as anybody else in the province of Ontario.", "Seventeen employers did not have active internship programs at the time of the inspection, but what the inspectors did in that regard was to make sure that they were given educational materials for their future reference, so that these employers, should they at some point in the future decide to revive or continue an internship program or introduce a new one, would know very specifically what the rules are governing interns in this province.", "What we found was that 13 employers had internship positions and had Employment Standards Act contraventions. What we did with those 13 employers was, we issued 37 compliance orders and we told them to pay the wages. Very simply, we told them they were doing the wrong thing. As much as perhaps they thought they were doing the right thing, we told them that they were in contravention of the act. What that allowed was for close to $50,000 to be paid to interns that should have been paid all along. The full amount has been recovered. Each one of those companies has stepped forward and done the right thing and now knows that, moving forward, this is how they have to conduct themselves.", "What we found was that the most common monetary violations were for three things: minimum wage, vacation pay and not paying for public holidays. They have changed. The most common non-monetary violations were for such things as wage statements, record keeping and hours of work.", "What you have in the province of Ontario now is, you have employers who thought they were doing the right thing in the past, were told they weren’t and have now turned themselves around and are complying with the law. That’s what we wanted.", "Speaker, in order to proactively protect the rights of workers, the proposed legislation you have before you would give the Ministry of Labour the authority to require employees to conduct self-audits to determine their own compliance with the Employment Standards Act. We will go into companies. We will tell them, “Take a very careful look at what you’re doing. Do an audit of yourself and report back to us and tell us whether you think you’re complying with the Employment Standards Act or not.” If they aren’t, then certainly we will prosecute if we find there are places that we need increased enforcement.", "What we’re trying to do is provide a tool that’s going to promote compliance with the Employment Standards Act, and we’re going to expand the program’s reach, we think, in a very significant way, in a way that’s efficient and cost-effective. It allows employers to voluntarily do the right thing. It asks them to take a long look at how they’re conducting themselves, and it’s asking them, at the end of the day, if they find themselves in contravention of the act, to come into compliance.", "Finally, Speaker, we know that all construction is a key driver of Ontario’s economy. Our government recognizes this and, as a result, we’re investing $35 billion in infrastructure projects over the next three years. That’s going to create and support 100,000 jobs each year. That’s going to grow our communities. It’s going to build our economy.", "That’s why we’re strengthening the Labour Relations Act, the cornerstone of what I think is a fair and balanced labour relations system. What we’re proposing to do here is something very, very simple but something that has been asked for and something that I think is going to really help labour relations between parties in the province of Ontario.", "Quite simply, we’re being asked—and we’re asking the House to support this bill—to reduce the collective agreement open period in the construction industry from three months to two. What happens when the collective agreement opens up? Often, there’s a desire, perhaps, to consider changing unions, to consider unionizing, to consider decertifying. A whole host of choices is available to people during that open period. What this will allow our skilled workers to spend more time doing is building the roads, the bridges, the schools and the hospitals we need to grow our economy and to ensure that a prosperous Ontario will remain prosperous for generations to come.", "We’re proposing to reduce that period from three months to two months. What all parties have come forward and said to us is that they think two months is adequate time to make those types of decisions, to finalize an agreement, to make a decision, and then simply to move on. They found that the three-month period simply was too disruptive, and it led to an awful lot of non-productive effort.", "To further protect businesses that play by the rules and to further strengthen our economy, the Ministry of Labour is proposing to develop and share with key stakeholders an operational policy regarding enhanced use of enforcement tools, particularly with regard to those people who perhaps don’t get it the first time: the repeat offenders in our system. Enforcement tools such as notices of contravention allow for higher penalties for subsequent violations. That’s going to help the ministry target those unscrupulous employers that simply don’t play by the rules, the way that most Ontario business does.", "Speaker, I mentioned earlier in my statement that my ministry will electronically make available clear employment standards information. This information is a crucial piece of our larger enforcement strategy. Employers will be much more likely to comply with the Employment Standards Act if their employees are aware of those rights under the Employment Standards Act. As I spoke to earlier, language barriers often prevent that. What we’re doing is requiring those employers to provide a translation as long as we have that translation available in the Ministry of Labour. We do have an exhaustive list of languages and dialects that we’re able to do business in.", "As I wrap up, the proposed Stronger Workplaces for a Stronger Economy Act is about taking action to protect workers, especially the most vulnerable in our society. It’s about levelling the playing field for businesses that play by the rules and have always played by the rules.", "We simply want to ensure that employees in the province of Ontario are paid for the work they do, and that temporary help agency employees are provided the fairness that we get and that they deserve.", "We want to ensure that foreign employees have the protections they need and deserve when they set out to make a new life in the province of Ontario.", "Our government’s economic plan is about creating jobs for today and for tomorrow. Along with this bill, we’re investing in infrastructure, we’re investing in skills training, we’re investing in second careers for people, and we’re moving forward with a youth jobs strategy for our younger workers.", "We’re also proceeding, using a very measured and a very balanced approach, to balance the budget. We’re building on our knowledge economy and we’re supporting small business.", "The comprehensive plan and six priorities focus on Ontario’s greatest strengths, but most importantly, this bill is an indication that we’re also prepared to invest in our people, the people in this province. It has been said that the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members. This is an example today of how we can help further that. We can and we will help build our economy, and at the same time, we can work together to protect the most vulnerable.", "Speaker, we’re all one Ontario here. We stand up for each other. When people move here, they move here for a reason. It’s because the province of Ontario has developed a reputation internationally that I believe, as a proud Ontarian, is second to none. By supporting this bill, and I’m asking all members of the House to support the bill at second reading, we’re enhancing the reputation that the province of Ontario enjoys around the world as a people, as a society, as an economy that treats its workers the way that any one of us would want to be treated." ],

It would take important steps to ensure that every Ontarian gets the paycheque they have earned at the end of the day. It would help safeguard temporary foreign workers who have come to our province and deserve workplace fairness. It would better protect interns and other unpaid learners from dangerous work situations, and importantly, it would increase the competitiveness of businesses who obey the laws and play by the rules.", "We are all aware of the growth in precarious and temporary work that has taken place not only in our province but across Canada. This includes employment where workers are in temporary jobs. I see many of them in Holland Marsh as I drive through on my way from Barrie to here. These employees may have difficulty establishing themselves financially, which has a negative impact on the economic growth of our province. It is also a key factor in poverty and near poverty. Many of the people in my riding are in this situation.", "Recent reports such as the United Way and McMaster University report It’s More Than Poverty, prepared by PEPSO, the Poverty and Employment Precarity in Southern Ontario research group, have helped bring attention to this problem of precarious work. We have also taken note of the Vulnerable Workers and Precarious Work report of the Law Commission of Ontario. That is why I am happy to be here to tell you that we are taking steps to address these issues. Our bill would help us enforce our laws and protect vulnerable workers owed money by their employers. Our bill also reflects what we have heard from Ontarians about the needs that they have due to the changing nature of work in our province, which is also occurring throughout Canada.", "First, I would like to review the basic provisions of the bill and then address particular provisions of it and questions that may arise. Our proposed legislation, if passed, would amend the Employment Standards Act to remove a $10,000 cap on recovery of wages through a Ministry of Labour order. It would increase the limit on recovery of wages from six to 12 months, to two years. It would provide added protection for temporary help agency workers. It would require employers to provide workers with a free copy of information about their employment standards rights, if they request, translated into their own language if such translation is available from the ministry. And it would enable the Ministry of Labour to require employers to complete a self-audit of their records and practices to determine compliance with the ESA.", "A very important provision of this bill is that it would provide fairness and justice to temporary foreign workers and would amend the Employment Protection for Foreign Nationals Act (Live-in Caregivers and Others), 2009, to extend protections that currently only apply to live-in caretakers to all foreign employees who come to Ontario under an immigration or foreign temporary employee program. It would protect all foreign workers from having an employer withhold personal documents, like a passport, and it would protect all foreign workers from being charged recruitment or other fees by a recruiter.", "Foreign workers can work in many industries. Those occupations include agricultural workers, construction workers, professionals in business services and management, musicians and singers, university professors, engineers, specialist physicians, information technology workers, teaching and research assistants, and truck drivers, as well as live-in caregivers.", "The Ministry of Labour has developed an enhanced education and outreach strategy to protect temporary foreign workers, to help ensure compliance with our laws among those who employ them and to raise general awareness in this sector by placing educational materials in locations and on websites where employers have hired or intend to hire foreign workers. Foreign workers can also access fact sheets on our Ministry of Labour website, or they can call our Employment Standards Information Centre, toll-free, at 1-800-531-5551, to get information in many different languages about their rights and how to file a claim.", "For those employed by temporary help agencies—and we all know that employment in this sector has increased in recent years—this proposed legislation builds on our 2009 legislation. That legislation ensures that temporary agency assignment employees aren’t charged fees for things like resumé writing or taking a job with an agency client, and are not prevented from becoming permanently employed.", "If passed, Bill 18 would amend the Employment Standards Act to make temporary help agencies and their clients jointly and severally liable for certain unpaid wages owing to the agency’s employees. This means that clients would potentially be liable if an agency failed to pay regular wages and overtime to an agency employee who had been assigned to perform work for a client.", "If passed, our bill would better protect temporary help agency workers and ensure that temporary help agencies that operate above board could better compete. It’s right that we reward those who follow the law. It would also encourage employers to work with reputable agencies and hire workers directly themselves.", "All workplaces in Ontario currently covered by the ESA must post a Ministry of Labour poster on Employment Standards Act rights and responsibilities. However, vulnerable employees may be reluctant to read or copy information from the poster in the workplace; I have witnessed this myself in many areas. Therefore, our bill would require that employers provide individual employees with a copy of this information, which is available from the ministry. This will significantly increase the likelihood that vulnerable employees will learn about their employment standards rights.", "Our bill would also amend the Occupational Health and Safety Act to extend to unpaid co-op students and other unpaid learners the same health and safety rights as paid workers. This is right and just. Even if you are a co-op student in a university, college or other program where you are receiving educational credits, you deserve the same health and safety protections as every other worker, and that is exactly what the government is intending to ensure with this proposed amendment.", "Under our bill, unpaid students, learners and trainees would be defined as workers under the OHSA, and would have the same rights and duties as the paid workers they work alongside. For example, they would also have the right to know about workplace hazards, the right to participate in joint health and safety committees and as safety representatives, and the right to refuse unsafe work.", "Unpaid learners such as co-op students would also have the same duties as paid workers.

This period is referred to as the open period.", "The length of that period can result in increased uncertainty for employers, employees and unions. To achieve more stable and harmonious labour relations, it would be preferable to reduce the period of uncertainty while still retaining the ability of employees to decide. Our bill, if passed, would amend the Labour Relations Act to reduce the open period in construction industry collective agreements from three months to two months. This will reduce the period of uncertainty and the potential for disruption in this key economic sector.", "Speaker, we must build and strengthen our province’s economy and businesses, but we must also protect Ontario’s most vulnerable employees. I will take a few moments to describe some of the work the Ministry of Labour is currently undertaking to protect vulnerable workers, including temporary foreign workers.", "In September, the ministry began a three-month employment standards blitz, focusing on vulnerable employees. Ministry of Labour employment standards officers are conducting inspections to determine compliance with the Employment Standards Act, 2000, focusing on sectors known to hire a high proportion of vulnerable or temporary foreign workers, including restaurants, building services and personal care services—for example, hair, esthetic and massage services.", "Our inspectors are also focusing on business support services, such as collection agencies and call centres, and also horticulture businesses, such as nurseries and greenhouses.", "Employment standards officers will check for compliance with core employment standards under the Employment Standards Act, with a particular focus on public holidays, vacation pay, minimum wage, record-keeping and payment of wages.", "Our government is taking major steps to fulfill its commitment to protect vulnerable workers by enhancing proactive enforcement of the Employment Standards Act, 2000. As part of the 2013 budget, the government invested ongoing funding of $3 million for additional employment standards officers and staff. This funding is being used to hire and train new staff and to conduct even more proactive inspections.", "The Ministry of Labour is also planning to develop and to share with key stakeholders an operational policy regarding enhanced use of the Employment Standards Act enforcement tools, particularly with regard to repeat offenders.", "Minister Flynn began his second reading House statement on Bill 18 with comments on the legislative proposal to increase Ontario’s minimum wage using the Ontario consumer price index, so perhaps it is fitting that I end my statement on that topic. Speaker, our government is committed to building a more prosperous Ontario while creating the jobs of today and tomorrow, and providing more opportunities for all. It is important to remember that when we came to office, the minimum wage had been frozen for eight years straight. That was not fair to workers, who saw their cost of living increase while their wages stayed frozen. That’s why our government has increased the minimum wage by 50% since 2003. Against the opposition’s wishes, our government has raised the minimum wage from $6.85 to the $11 it is today. I constantly get thanked for this when I’m out in public.", "We increased it during good times and during the depths of recession because it was the right thing to do. Everyone should be able to move forward and to remain safe and protected while doing so. Ontario went from having one of the lowest minimum wages in Canada to one of the highest, because that’s what hard-working Ontario families deserve.", "A look at the past 20 years shows us that decisions on increasing the minimum wage were too often ad hoc and left to the political whims of the day. That was not fair to workers, who did not know what their hourly wage would be from one year to the next, and unpredictable for businesses, who could not plan for the future. That is why our government has introduced a fair, predictable and transparent approach to setting minimum wage in the future within Bill 18. Our proposed legislation would require all future adjustments to the minimum wage to be annual and tied to the increase in Ontario’s consumer price index. This would ensure that our province’s minimum wage keeps pace with the cost of living in a way that allows our businesses to plan for the future and continue to create jobs.", "Tying our minimum wage to the change in Ontario’s annual CPI was one of Ontario’s Minimum Wage Advisory Panel’s consensus recommendations in the report put forward by the chair of the panel. On behalf of Minister Flynn, myself and all Ontarians, I would like to thank Professor Anil Verma and the Minimum Wage Advisory Panel members for their dedication to this report and all their hard work. We will be acting on all of the panel’s thorough and thoughtful recommendations. Under our proposed legislation, the first CPI adjustment would take place on October 1, 2015, and would be announced on April 1, 2015." ],

It’s a bit of a buzzword. Who wouldn’t argue for that in many cases, particularly if you’re the person at that minimum wage level wanting more? But we have to look at what the realities of that type of legislation will do to our ability to actually employ more people. Will an increase to the minimum wage actually increase employment, or will it actually have a negative impact? I think that’s something we have to look at wholeheartedly.", "If the Liberal government really wanted to do something to make stronger workplaces, it would have focused on what I hear most in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, in my riding—and a lot of my colleagues share the same thinking when we’re in caucus: lower energy rates. We have the highest energy rates on the continent. That’s driving people out of Ontario. It’s stopping people from coming to Ontario. And even businesses in my riding that I’m talking to about expanding certainly aren’t in that frame of mind right now, particularly because of that.", "The other piece is, certainly, red tape. They’re drowning in red tape. We’ve heard it since the day I walked through these doors, and yet I haven’t seen anything happen. The Liberals, again, have been in power for 11 years.

I know how important it is in labour relations legislation to get the balance right, and I believe that what we’ve done here is exactly that: getting the balance right between employees’ rights and employers’ rights, protecting employees, not having too much red tape but getting the balance where it should be to protect vulnerable workers.", "I want to focus particularly, Mr. Speaker, on the pieces here that protect foreign workers.

Much of what’s in your bill can be considered housekeeping and necessary amendments to existing pieces of legislation. I do find it disappointing, though, Minister, that you’ve taken what were two very separate bills in the last session and put them together in this one new bill. That’s fine when the bills are of a similar matter, similar substance, similar nature, but when we take policies very disparate, very irrelevant to one another and then combine them into a bill, it puts the whole House at a disadvantage to having a genuine and thoughtful debate on those aspects of the bill.", "The minister just mentioned amendments in committee. I would ask the minister to truly consider removing the minimum wage bill out of this one and keeping the housekeeping aspects in one bill and the minimum wage component in a very unique and separate bill. Hopefully he’ll take that under due consideration. I think it just benefits all of us here in the Legislature if we can focus our debates on relevant subjects and not have these disparate subjects all bundled up together.", "First off, things like joint and several liability—that’s good.

I’m going to focus my comments more on the minimum wage aspect of this bill, with you already having the understanding that the other things we’re generally in agreement on.", "I’ll start by saying this: Although this talk of minimum wage has a lot of interesting aspects to it, there are a lot of important considerations about minimum wage that have not been talked about. I’d like the minister to consider some of these statistics and facts about minimum wage here in Ontario. Since 2003, we are the only province in this country that has doubled the percentage of participation in our workforce that is minimum wage. We are now approaching 10% of our workforce here in Ontario that is in the minimum wage category. Most other provinces have restrained or actually diminished the number of minimum wage workers in the workforce. We have over 500,000 people now making minimum wage in the province.", "That’s something that this bill does not address. There hasn’t been any discussion or mention about it. Why does Ontario have the greatest percentage of minimum wage workers in our workforce? Minister, I’d like you to consider that. Are there things that we could do legislatively that would not necessarily just increase the minimum wage but increase the median wage of all people in this province? That’s an important part here, and I’ll come to this.", "Raising the minimum wage, if it results in raising the cost of living, is no advantage to anybody. If there’s no relative gain, then there is no benefit. That’s what I’m concerned about with this bill: that there will actually not be any tangible gain for those people in the minimum wage workforce.", "Minister, I think you can probably—I remember that back in the 1970s, when I first started my working career when I left high school, it was commonplace back then for the industrial sector to have COLA clauses, cost-of-living increases, each and every year. Those cost-of-living increases—eventually we found out and realized that there was no benefit to them. They were actually detrimental. They continued to increase the cost of living.", "Now, COLA clauses, where we had this defined increase that was going to happen each and every year, regardless of if there was any change in productivity levels, fell out of favour back in the 1980s. COLA clauses were found out and proven to be false, and here we see this government looking at repeating some of this with tying things to the cost of living. Will that also increase and begin to spiral, ensure that there is an increase in the CPI?", "I also want to suggest, Minister, what do we do now, as well? And I’d like to hear a response from the Liberal side. If we go on this track where we are going to define and guarantee an increase in minimum wage costs based on CPI, is it not also, then, indicative and intuitive that we must do the same thing for OW, ODSP and others? How many others? Will we do it for the Ontario public service? Will we do it for the broader public service? Will we not run the risk of fuelling inflation by having a guaranteed increase each and every year but no increase in productivity, and therefore no relative gain whatsoever?", "I would like the minister to respond to us, during this debate, as to what their considerations are for Ontario Works and ODSP, and for those other incomes derived from the public purse. Have you considered that? What is your position? Will you be implementing further items such as CPI tied to the minimum wage?", "I want to just share a few statistics. I told you about Ontario having the largest percentage of minimum wage workers of any province in this country, nearly 10% of our workforce. That should give us some concerns. Let me give you some examples. Next door in Manitoba, the minimum wage is 30 cents per hour less than it is here in Ontario, but part-time workers earn six cents more on average in Manitoba than they do in Ontario, and workers who are 15 to 24 years of age in Manitoba earn, on average, 29 cents more per hour than workers in Ontario. So, even though they have a lower minimum wage, on average those part-time and youth workers are making more in Manitoba.", "If we continue to go west, to Saskatchewan, the minimum wage drops down to $10.20 per hour, but we see even further increases in youth and part-time wages in Saskatchewan. In Saskatchewan they have a $1.40-per-hour increase over Ontario for the age group 15 through 24—again, a lower minimum wage, but higher average earnings for youth.

I’d like the minister or somebody on the Liberal side afterwards to really address what I’ve just said. What are you doing to actually improve the livelihood and the prosperity of our part-time and our youth who are working increasingly more and more at minimum wage? As we see across the country, other provinces seem to be doing substantially better and actually reducing the number of people who are working in the minimum wage category and improving their opportunities for prosperity.", "I can go on about this, but I think that looking at or listening to the debate about minimum wage, there have been some changes in the discussion over the years. I know that when I got out of school, or even when I was in school, minimum wage was viewed strictly as a means to support and protect those vulnerable people who were just getting into the workforce. It was never expected that people would stay at that minimum wage. It was an entry level, and they would soon move on, progress and be more prosperous. But now the discussion seems to be of the nature that we’ve just accepted that there will be many, many people who will stay at minimum wage, not just the youth, not just part-time, not just service, accommodations or retail—even though they do take up, by far, the largest percentage of people making the minimum wage in Ontario. But why it is now that we’ve accepted or tolerated that that is the new reality in Ontario’s workforce, that people must accept that your best outcome in Ontario will be a minimum wage job? I don’t buy it. I don’t think it’s right. I think it’s wrong. I think it’s harmful when we have that acceptance.", "We need to get this province increasing the workforce, not just at the minimum wage rates but at the much-improved rates, like what we’ve seen in these other provinces.", "I can tell you that I have four children—they’re all out of the house now. Three of them are working out west. The opportunities for significant improvements in income, in employment—hands down, hands down. They would have been foolish to stay here in Ontario with the opportunities that were available to them out west. They could have stayed here. It wasn’t a case of not being able to get any work, just that the quality of employment was substantially diminished as to what they could find out west.", "I hope those things do change down the road, and that not just my sons can find good employment in Ontario once again but that all our sons and daughters can find improved employment in Ontario.

It says, “Minimum wage workers are disproportionately concentrated in two industries: retail trade and accommodation and food services.” We know that. “In terms of age, the youth stand out as a group among minimum wage earners. Youth in the 15-19 years age group are only 4.9% of the total workforce” in Ontario, “but they form a solid 42.1% of the minimum wage workforce.” That’s ages 15 to 19. That probably doesn’t surprise anybody, because once again, that’s what minimum wage was intended for, those people who are just entering the workforce.", "I would like, during this debate on Bill 18, to hear some comments from the government side about this change of discussion, where the government has now, in my view, from what I’ve heard, just accepted the fact that minimum wage is no longer just for our youth.

I think he also, though, raised good issues out there, those being that there were two bills here that were bundled into one, and our concern is going to be, do things get lost in there? Is it too much to try to do? If we really wanted to make differences, we could have taken each of these bills and done them in a detailed manner to ensure that we’re truly getting the best legislation.", "In a small, rural place like Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, what I hear from a lot of the single mom-and-pop shops that are the bulk of the employers in small, rural communities, particularly with regard to the minimum wage, is that it may make a difference whether that store—a convenience store, a small market—stays open for extended hours in the evening or late hours on the weekends, when a lot of our tourists are up. And can they truly afford that? Is it actually going to be a case of whether they employ more people or are they actually going to employ less people? Are they going to have to pick up the slack and work more in advance of the 70 to 80 hours they work now? And, again, is that service going to be there? If that service isn’t there, not as many people are coming to shop in those small communities, which, again, is a downward negative spiral. I think it’s something we really have to look at, to see whether there truly is a balance at the end of the day by increasing.", "We’ve had some of my other colleagues talking about the fruit growers, who have said—and I’ll talk later today in my comments about one in my riding who has actually given a very good case, I think, for the concerns he has in regard to the fruit growers and increased minimum wages there. I think we need to ensure that anything we’re doing is going to actually end in the result being that there is better employment.", "The other concern I have is, are kids entering the workforce going to get that very viable job experience, that very first opportunity to get out in the workforce and truly learn what work is? I’m concerned that some of these changes may do that. Generally, overall, I’m in favour of anything that’s going to improve.

These changes will allow workers to recover a greater proportion of their actual lost wages when employers have violated the Employment Standards Act over an extended period of time.", "I see this as coming not a moment too soon—or too late, depending on where you’re at—because, of course, why would we limit wages to be recovered by an employee from an employer who is unscrupulous and is fighting that employee every step of the way? Let’s ensure that if someone is owed more than $10,000, they are afforded the ability to pursue those back wages to that full extent. Of course, extending the period of time in which they can go after that money as well will be a welcome addition to that.", "Secondly, the new temp agency record keeping and joint and several liability for temp agency workers is an interesting component of the overall bill.

The gap exists in terms of who enforces the Employment Standards Act, who is responsible for training, who is responsible for benefits, who is responsible for all the measures and compliance under the Employment Standards Act. What this does is compel those two entities to both be responsible. So no longer will there be any ambiguity as to who is responsible when someone is contracted through a temporary agency.", "I think it speaks to the larger problem, however, that the explosion of temp agencies has become the norm for labour market supply in the province of Ontario. It was alluded to by our colleague from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington, in terms of why do we have these temp jobs, low-wage-paying jobs, precarious work; why is it that we see such prominence of this in the province of Ontario?", "I would say, and I would submit and argue, that it is primarily because of Conservative and Liberal policy at both the federal and provincial levels for at least a decade, and that has welcomed that type of employment, that sector of employment that typically provides no real net benefit in terms of what a manufacturing base would have done. These are more typically service-based jobs—not to say they are not important, but they are always less valued or devalued on the market in terms of labour supply.", "When we use free trade agreements that outsource and allow cheap imports to flood our markets, there is no longer a demand for a resource-based economy, in the province of Ontario, where we establish higher levels of employment for turning our resources into products—value-added employment. That doesn’t exist when you’re flooding neighbourhoods and communities with call centres and fast-food agencies and Walmarts. Speaker, it is Walmartization, if that is a word—I believe it actually may be somewhere in the lexicon. That’s what Liberal and Conservative policy has done.

It requires distribution of the employment standards poster to every employee and adds another tool: the employer self-audit. I have some questions about this, some serious questions. The self-audit is an interesting wrinkle. It gives the employment standards branch the power to order an employer to conduct a self-audit of its records to determine if it is in compliance with the act or regulations. The employer must conduct the audit and report its findings to the employment standards office.", "Speaker, I will tell you that if my grade school, my high school and my university professors allowed me the opportunity to fill in my own report card, I would stand before you today as a straight-A student. It would have been impeccable and so would my attendance. I would have been perfect, but unfortunately that wasn’t the case. There were some areas in schooling that I did not succeed in and did not excel in. You can go back and check my report card.", "I’m concerned that this is the tool that the government is giving to employers: “Conduct your own self-audit, tell us how great you are, tell us how you are in compliance with the Employment Standards Act, and everything will be all right.” I’m interested to hear what the specifics are within that provision of the bill.", "As you heard from my colleague the member from London West, who brought forward her own bill—she tabled Bill 22, the protection for interns and vulnerable workers act, one that I hope my colleagues across the way on the government side take the time to read, because it does go a lot further in terms of protecting the most vulnerable in Ontario. But as you heard her mention, she took the government’s own numbers and those straight from the minister’s comments today that the recent blitz that was conducted resulted in 56 inspections. They found 31 companies with interns who weren’t a part of an educational program or a co-operative program, 13 of them breaking the law, which extrapolated means that 42% of those 56 inspections resulted in a violation of the Employment Standards Act. That’s astounding, Speaker, and it begs the government to do more on the enforcement side.", "We heard that a figure of $3 million annually will be put forward to augment some enforcement provisions, but it’s not nearly enough. It’s not nearly enough when it comes to the Employment Standards Act, and it certainly is not nearly enough when it comes to the Occupational Health and Safety Act; I’ll get to that. I do believe that the provisions in this bill that touch on health and safety might very well be the most important from the perspective of working people in this province.", "Number four, Speaker: The bill introduces new protections for foreign nationals working in Ontario, and, by extending protections for live-in caregivers in the Employment Protection for Foreign Nationals Act to other foreign nationals working or looking for work in Ontario, such as temporary foreign workers, it replicates what currently exists for live-in caregivers, provisions that protect them similarly as if they were long-time employees or long-time residents of Ontario. That is good, fair and just, and we applaud that. However, there are some gaps that exist that we wonder on this side of the bench if the government couldn’t bring forward—particularly the gap in terms of the three-month wait time for temporary foreign workers or foreign nationals who come here seeking employment, and who are then employed and retained by a company, to immediately begin to receive Ontario OHIP benefits.", "I submit that there is no better time to examine this provision than right now, given the considerations of the Ebola epidemic that we see, where industrialized nations such as Canada, who have progressive health care systems and good health care systems, should play a role in ensuring that for anyone who comes here who isn’t receiving or who hasn’t received proper health care services in their home country, we can then play a role in ensuring that they get proper health care.", "We’ve seen, just recently, 300 cases of tuberculosis. On March 2, 2011, 300 foreign nationals arrived in Canada with diagnosed cases of tuberculosis. We can play a role in stopping epidemics like Ebola and tuberculosis simply by expanding and extending our health care system to those people who come here. I think it’s really a measure of humanity that the government has the ability to do.", "Under that provision—number 4 on my list, at least; I don’t know if the government has labelled it as such—it does speak about the banning of recruitment fees. Specifically, I believe, it is targeted among the migrant worker population in Ontario.", "If you can imagine the prospect of leaving your home country, leaving your family, for a job that has been presented to you at a certain wage and benefits, being sold a bill of goods and arriving there—putting your life on hold in your home country and coming to a foreign country, having to leverage everything you have, borrowing from unscrupulous lenders just to be able to get that job, and having your citizenship documents held in order to secure that employment—unbelievable.", "I commend the minister and the government for addressing this issue. It’s one that I think can send a clear message to other jurisdictions that people deserve to be treated fairly, that no matter where you come from, this place, Ontario, is a safe place, one that values fairness, one that values protection and the work that each and every one of us does—no matter where you’re from—to provide for our families and to make our province a better place. With that, it requires some responsibility from the government to ensure that those rules are enforced. I do salute, certainly, this provision of the bill.", "Advocates are calling for some measures of strengthening. Of course, New Democrats are anxious to hear testimony at committee, if this bill is indeed passed and does end up in committee. Some of those advocates are calling for the strengthening of Bill 18 to give the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration the power to create registries for employers and recruiters. Let’s know who is bringing in foreign nationals, who is bringing in temporary foreign workers or migrant workers. Let’s understand where they are so that we can assist them in learning about these laws.", "I mean, my goodness, if we are to enact provisions of security and provisions of protection for migrant workers, let’s know where they are, and let’s ensure that our employment standards officials and our labour officials know how to access them and to give them the information that they need to be safe and to be treated fairly.", "They’re also calling on recruiters to be required to put forward mandatory financial security in the form of a bond, an irrevocable letter of credit, or a deposit before being licensed, and that recruiters and employers are jointly and severally liable for any and all exploitative recruitment practices in Canada and abroad.", "That would make sense, considering that you’re applying that same mandate to temporary work agencies that are based in Ontario. In essence, recruiters who are bringing in temporary foreign workers are doing the same job. Let’s extend that same joint and several liability to those folks as well. I hope this is something that the government considers.", "Also, another provision that the government might want to consider is that employers be prohibited from charging any fees to migrant workers, and that the onus of fee non-payment be on the recruiter, not the migrant worker; that the time limit on complaints be at least five years so that workers can seek justice after their contract finishes; also, that all migrant workers coming into Ontario have full access to full immigration status, access to social benefits, protections from reprisal and meaningful labour protections. Speaker, that would certainly go a long way in terms of levelling the playing field—access to justice, access to fairness for migrant workers who toil in our province every day—but, as we are here and as we speak, they are not protected the same way that other workers are in the province. I think it is a shame.", "That was number four. Number five of this bill, Bill 18—I’ll just take a little sip of water and wet my whistle. That’s good. Thank you, Speaker.

Those valuable principles are the most important things they need to learn early on in their careers.

I understand what this means; I understand what it does. It eliminates confusion on worksites. I can tell you that as a trade unionist and as someone who has been involved in organizing workplaces and involved in certifying workplaces, you know when that open period is and you’ve prepared for that open period months and years in advance. If you can’t get the job done in two months, then you probably don’t deserve to represent those workers.", "I think it will aid in some stability in those workplaces.

I certainly will look forward to hearing from my friends in the trade union movement who will have a new reality to deal with, and we’ll see how they make do with it.", "Number seven amends the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act to clarify responsibilities for workers who are injured during a job placement arranged by a temporary health agency by attributing the cost to the employer where the injury occurs and assessing wages by reference to income earned from the agency. Again, a welcome baby step forward, something that I believe clarifies and closes a gap that only exists because of the enormous prevalence and exponential growth of temporary work agencies that have flooded our labour market here.

The steps that you’ve made will only compound the problem.

Those correlations cannot be ignored; I guess they are being ignored. If you’re not going to fill the gap, which governments of the day for more than decade have proven not to be able to, then at least allow workers to organize and to be represented by trade unions that are going to fill that gap and protect them at work and negotiate good wages and benefits.

  "text" : [ "Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Sorry; it’s the first day back.", "But it is always a pleasure to get up and talk about a piece of legislation which has some potential to actually make the lives of people in the province better and workers safer. It was referenced that this piece of legislation died on the order paper with the election, but there was an earlier version, an early variation of this piece of legislation actually that died on the order paper as well when the former Premier of this province prorogued Parliament—over a hundred pieces of legislation died as well then.", "We’ve seen this several times, and there are some themes that are recurring, but every time a piece of legislation like Stronger Workplaces for a Stronger Economy Act comes before us it does provide an opportunity for us to make the legislation stronger. As my colleague pointed out, there are some things that are actually good in this legislation, and I think I’m going to start with that.", "The issue of banning recruitment fees, for instance, has been a long-standing issue in the province of Ontario. Migrant workers, women in particular, have been asked to pay unscrupulous recruiters tens of thousands of dollars to gain access to Ontario, to gain access to employment opportunities, which, in turn, turn out to be something other than what they were promised to be.", "The problem with a recruiter going to a foreign country, for instance, and saying, “For $10,000 you can access this country and this province,” is that it gives that job opportunity the illusion of being a credible job opportunity. We’ve actually just seen this recently in the news last week. There was a horrific death, the murder of a woman who came into this province as a nanny and was also, of course, being recruited into the sex trade field. I have to tell you, this is one of those issues that is subversive and undermines the very principles and values that we have, I think, as a province and as a country, and yet it has been going on for quite some time.", "What Bill 18, I think, proposes to do is to ban the recruitment fees and thereby, perhaps and hopefully, end the illusion that if you’re paying a huge amount of money to get into this province to access an employment opportunity, it’s a credible and legitimate and legal opportunity when the evidence actually proves otherwise.", "In the same vein, around recruitment fees and around the power that a recruiter has over a temporary worker, a migrant worker, there is the issue, also, of them withholding citizenship papers, undermining their rights. This is really an emerging trend in the country and in the province. We saw it at the national level with the temporary worker program when the Harper government created this huge loophole where large corporations could pull in very vulnerable people and have them work at corporations like McDonald’s, for instance; this was very recent, in the spring. We were horrified, as citizens of Ontario and as citizens of this country, to see that primarily these were young women who were being housed in local motels, who were working extremely long hours, who were not aware of their own rights as employees in the province of Ontario, as temporary citizens even. Also, they were pushing out long-standing employees of those corporations. The federal government has made some progress on that file, but I think that the two issues are very much connected.", "What advocates have been saying on the recruitment fees is—they have asked for the strengthening of Bill 18 as follows: They’ve asked that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration have the power to create registries for employers and recruiters. For us as legislators, as this legislation moves forward, we need to know where those people are, so there needs to be a registry. You have to understand the problem at hand in order to address the risk or to mitigate the risk or to protect those workers. This is something that we’re going to be looking at very closely. Obviously very connected to that is that all migrant workers who come to Ontario must have access to full immigration status, social benefits, protections from reprisals and meaningful labour protections.", "We have all come from outside of Canada, except for our First Nations, Métis and Inuit people. We all have a history of being immigrants to this country. In the past, though, when we came to the country we had the potential, the opportunity, to be full-fledged, respected citizens with all the rights that ensued. Disturbingly enough, the trend has been to essentially use people and then dispose of them. This is something that we have to be cognizant of. We have to acknowledge that it’s a problem, and we have to be cognizant of the fact that in order to prevent this from happening, you need strong oversight. Oversight, and the lack of oversight, has been a long-standing issue with the Ministry of Labour in this province. I cite the safety inconsistencies, for instance.", "For those of you who heard the petition read into the Hansard today, we on this side of the House, in this corner, have been fighting for better training for working at heights. This is long-standing. This stems from the Dean report of 2010, which determined that the safety regulations, the training, the oversight, the standards in this province were not up to a standard which was acceptable. There were almost 38 recommendations that came from that Dean report. Eleven of them were priorities. One of them specifically called for a mandated working-at-heights training standard. To date, that standard is not in place in the province of Ontario, which is ironic, because the government talks about building Ontario up, and actually Ontario is building up. We actually are intensifying, so we have more skyscrapers and more cranes across this province than we have ever had, so the need to train workers who are working at heights has never been more important.", "In fact, I just published a local op-ed piece on this very issue. If you’re not going to do it for the right reason, then do it because it makes financial sense. I costed out falls in the province of Ontario, the 800-or-so serious falls, and I costed out the cost of a claim to WSIB, and then countered that with the cost of actually putting in a training program which would prevent people from being injured in the workplace. This is not really rocket science at all; it’s just common sense—and I hesitate to use that word, for other obvious connotations. But it makes not only a compassionate case for bringing in the working-at-heights training program, but there is a strong financial case, a strong economic case, if you will.", "You can connect it to productivity or what have you. For me, it’s a little more personal, though, because a young man who was 23 years old fell to his death in my riding on October 10, just over a year ago. His name was Nick Lalonde. He had only been working on that site for five days, and he was a temporary contract worker. There was no workplace safety committee. There was no training. There were no posters. Posters have some purpose, I guess, and I think that Bill 18 calls for that. He went up to the 12th storey. He was not harnessed in, and he fell to his death. He left a child and a mother and a father and a whole community that, seriously, could not understand how this young man got to be in that position without being appropriately trained. This is after 18 workers died last year in the province of Ontario. They fell to their deaths.", "What Bill 18 has the capacity to do, and what we are charged with, I think, in this House, is ensuring that the legislation meets the emerging and current needs of workers in the province of Ontario.", "Certainly, as we look at the growing temp agencies that have, unfortunately, filled a huge gap in this province—in my mind, because of the lack of a cohesive employment/jobs strategy for the province of Ontario—because that has happened, we have more temporary workers working in agencies who are without the power to be strong advocates for themselves.", "I think that Minister Flynn was actually recently in—the Brantford Expositor reported that he was in Brantford. It’s interesting to know that in Brantford, the average for use of temporary workers is between 21% and 22%. So almost a quarter of the workers in Brantford look to a temp agency as the primary place of work, whereas the provincial average is 18%.", "So it’s good that he went to Brantford; it’s good that he sat down. The headline, though, reads, “Minister Gets Earful on Temp Agencies.” This had to do with the consultation on G18.", "This is what the people who are on the front lines said to the minister at the time. They said that they want transparency provisions so that workers could check a temp agency, its record, and whether there are violations of the Employment Standards Act.", "They want transparency in advertising. All of us in this House have examples of advertising which is misleading to workers, promising a certain rate, promising certain hours, promising certain conditions, sometimes benefits and perks, which turn out to be lies.", "This is what the front-line people have said to Minister Flynn—and, actually, the Speaker was also there that day. They want agencies to be required to get employees safety training. They do. Because they recognize that when these individuals actually are hurt in the workplace, they have no recourse, because they have no rights.", "They want stronger language to protect a worker’s right to refuse unsafe work, without the fear of reprisals. There is a huge power imbalance when you have a person who is—and I want to point out that a large number of these workers are women. They are marginalized citizens in the province of Ontario. They are new immigrants; they’re people without a high level of post-secondary education or education at all. Really, those who live on the margins are forced to work on the margins in the province of Ontario.", "In this consultation with the Minister of Labour they pointed out these weaknesses in the legislation as it’s presented right now. There’s obviously room for improvement. The minister at the time, based on this article, said that the increase in temporary help agencies is “a moving target.” Actually, I do agree with him on that. It is a moving target because there’s no true oversight over temp agencies. There’s an opportunity to strengthen so that they can’t come into one area and then leave really quickly, abandoning their responsibilities as an employer. He acknowledges that we need to have rules and laws in place to deal with that.", "An interesting piece, though, which I find not overly surprising, is that during this same round table with the minister and the Speaker on Bill 18, Garry MacDonald of the Brantford and District Labour Council noted that 72% of agencies had Employment Standards Act violations. That’s 72%.", "In Brantford, for instance, you have 22% of the population working for temp agencies, and 72% of those agencies have violations against them, around safety. So this is—it’s hard to actually find the words for it because Brantford, obviously, is a microcosm of what is happening in other jurisdictions, but it tells a very important story. It tells why the legislation is so important. It tells us that oversight has not been a priority for this Liberal government for 12 years now.", "Earlier, the Minister of Labour referenced the importance of hiring a Chief Prevention Officer. Well, I’d like to remind this House that this is the second Chief Prevention Officer that has been in this important role. The last one left. He just threw his hands up in the air. He said that if this government is not going to follow through on training-at-heights standards—that’s a benchmark. It’s a low-watermark level. This is basic common sense, that you train people when they are working in risky situations. He just left.", "We have a new Chief Prevention Officer, and we are still waiting, for four years. I’m told it’s coming, though. I have to tell you, all politics aside, if the regulation comes in through this Legislature, through Bill 18 or otherwise, around ensuring and mandating training for working at heights workplace safety, I will be the first person to stand up in this House and say, “Congratulations.” Let’s just make sure it’s strong; let’s make sure it’s good. Let’s keep the workers in this province safe.", "I totally agree with my colleague from Windsor-Essex. The opportunity for those paid internships and those co-op programs—the value of them is not only for skills acquisition. It’s also so that those young people who are having those experiential learning opportunities—and we know that students are hungry for those opportunities and we know that sometimes liability and litigation prevents those opportunities from happening. But why not build in some safeguards to ensure that when students go to a workplace, they know what their rights are, they know that they can refuse unsafe work, and they know that they will be protected through legislation if they stand up for themselves in that workplace?", "The work that’s before us, it’s a huge amount. You’ve really got a lot in this piece of legislation, which I find interesting. I know that there is a push to get some things done very quickly, but our interest is also to get those things done quickly and well so that there aren’t unintended consequences and so that the intent of the legislation actually is realized.", "Bill 18 also addresses curbing wage theft, and now this has come up in the House several times. In particular of course, we always talk about the tip-out bill which was brought forward by the former member of Beaches–East York, I think maybe three or four times, and now has been brought forward by the new member for Beaches–East York. There has to be some control for employers to not essentially steal from their employees. I think of the good people who serve us downstairs in the parliamentary restaurant, In Camera. I’ve asked them, Jenny and Candy and Richard—and of course Joseph is no longer there. We used to talk about the fact that they pool their tips as a collective. That’s very, very different than the employer taking those and distributing what he feels those employees should be garnered. There are ways to protect workers who depend on those gratuities, quite honestly. The minimum wage will obviously strengthen some of that temporary, part-time, precarious work.", "What we are seeing, actually, more and more in the province of Ontario is something called involuntary part-time work. We are seeing people who really do want to work more than 15 hours a week, but their employer is sort of capping and spreading it around a lot of people so that they don’t have to add to the benefits or whatever other secondary costs those employees bring to the table.", "We, of course, support a strong minimum wage. We did call for the increase to $12. We did also cost it and tie it to the cost of living, and then we also built in some supports for businesses so that they could transition to that place for Ontario’s workers. But in the work that’s before us with Bill 18, there are some basic places that need direct attention, and there are some places where we can strengthen this piece of legislation. I look forward to it getting to committee so that those conversations can be open and transparent for everyone in the House." ],

I’m sure that will come as no surprise to the government House leader, that I get concerned when we mould bills together. I know there’s a couple of cases—Bill 21 is sort of the same thing where the government has put a couple of bills together. Regardless of how other governments have done it, I think this government—at least they claim that they’re open and transparent; we heard again the government say one thing and do another this morning in question period. It gives an opportunity for the government, regardless of what happened at the ballot box, to help educate people, and I’m a firm believer that we need to educate a little more and maybe legislate a little less.", "As someone who worked in a constituency office, and now my own office which takes a tremendous amount of calls, I know one of the concerns that I have is the volume of people who don’t understand their rights and don’t understand what’s in some of the labour legislation. In my office, we’ve never done anything like an unpaid internship. We do work with some of the local high schools and deal with a co-op placement, but you know what? It’s very, very important that each and every one of us, no matter what bill gets tabled, do our job as legislators and make sure we advocate for people so that they understand what’s in the laws, so they understand their rights in the workforce. I think if we can put more emphasis on education, we’ll do a good job here in the Legislative Assembly." ],

I hear talk of a newcomer registry and occupational health and safety; further to the whole piece on education, I think that’s extremely important for us to know, and I’m going to watch how this bill plays out to ensure that the education piece is there. So when we have newcomers to our community—let’s say it’s Greater Sudbury—and they’re working, we need to know that they are there. We need the outreach—the multicultural and folk arts association does a great job with outreach—and we need to educate them on their rights. Hopefully, those rights include an expanded ability to access social services and health. I think that’s extremely important.", "In terms of occupational health and safety, whether it’s interns, co-ops or new workers to our communities, they need to know that they can turn down work that’s not safe. If they don’t feel safe, they shouldn’t be there. We see that in the mines. To that, I hope that the government shows its progressiveness and brings in anti-replacement legislation.

If they’re operating a business they deserve to know their competitor isn’t undercutting them by not paying their workers. Unfortunately right now, there are both time and monetary limits on claiming unpaid wages. So we’re making it easier for workers to get the money owed them by proposing to remove the $10,000 cap under the Employment Standards Act on the recovery of unpaid wages through a Ministry of Labour order to pay. That means employees would no longer be forced to pursue larger claims to the courts, saving both workers and businesses time and money.", "If passed, Ontario will also increase the time limit for recovery of wages under the Employment Standards Act to two years, so that older claims are dealt with fairly and workers get the money they’re owed.", "The number of temporary foreign workers in Ontario has risen from 91,000 in 2008 to 130,000 in 2013. Now is the time to act. Speaker, no one should ever have to surrender their passport to be promised a job that doesn’t exist or be charged inappropriate recruitment fees. That’s why the proposed changes would amend the Employment Protection for Foreign Nationals Act our government passed in 2009, to apply to all temporary foreign workers in Ontario who are here through an immigration program like the federal Temporary Foreign Worker Program. That would mean temporary foreign workers would have protection against being charged recruitment fees and having personal documents such as passports withheld by employers.", "Speaker, many of us in this House often hear from workers who are unable to find a permanent job but, rather, are working through a temporary help agency. Our government was the first in Canada to introduce legislation specifically addressing temporary help agencies in 2009. That legislation made sure employees were not unfairly prevented from being hired directly by employers. It prohibited agencies from charging fees to workers for such things as resumé writing and interview preparation, and it required agencies to provide employees with information about their rights under the Employment Standards Act. I’m glad that these new protections, if passed, will better protect workers recruited through the temporary help agencies by establishing joint and several liability between agencies and their clients for failure to pay wages. This will help level the playing field for good employers. Clients of agencies would be liable for regular wages and overtime pay if the agencies don’t pay up, encouraging those companies to use agencies that treat their employees fairly.", "Speaker, we also know safe workplaces come down to people looking after one another. I said earlier, as a father of three children who have been through co-op placements, I’m very concerned that my children are safe and all young people are safe as they enter these programs. The Ministry of Labour has been undergoing its largest transformation in the last 30 years, creating a culture that puts health and safety at the centre of every workplace. Our job is to make sure workers go home to their families at the end of the day. That’s what people expect when they go to work or they go to a co-op placement, and that’s what they deserve.", "Speaker, Ontario has very clear rules that if you are performing work for someone, you are entitled to rights and protections under the Employment Standards Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act. That means you must be paid at least minimum wage, no matter what your job title is or what you agreed to when you started working there. Currently, the Occupational Health and Safety Act clearly covers paid workers. This bill, if passed, would ensure that coverage for unpaid co-op students and other unpaid trainees and learners performing work for course credit as part of a secondary or post-secondary school program—it would ensure that such unpaid students would have the same rights and protections as other workers.", "Speaker, the proposed Stronger Workplaces for a Stronger Economy Act is about taking action to protect workers, especially the most vulnerable, and levelling the playing field for businesses that play by the rules. We want to ensure that employees are paid for the work they do and that temporary help agency employees are provided the fairness they deserve. We want to ensure that foreign workers have the protection they deserve. We can and must work together to protect the most vulnerable in our province. This proposed legislation is about standing up for some of the most vulnerable workers in our province and providing them with the safeguards they need and deserve.", "As I said earlier, this proposed legislation will establish a fair and predictable means of increasing the minimum wage to keep pace with inflation; take important steps to ensure that every Ontarian gets the paycheque they’ve earned at the end of the day; and help safeguard temporary foreign workers who have come to our province and deserve workplace fairness.", "Again, it would better protect the interns and other unpaid learners from dangerous work situations; and, importantly, it would increase competitiveness for businesses that obey our laws and play by the rules.", "We’re all aware of growth in precarious and temporary work that has taken place not only in our province but across Ontario, and that includes employment where workers are in temporary jobs. It’s also a key factor in poverty and near-poverty. As my colleague alluded to earlier today, a recent report from the United Way and McMaster University, It’s More than Poverty, brought attention to the problem of this precarious work. The government has also taken note of a report on vulnerable workers and precarious work from the Law Commission of Ontario.", "That’s why I’m happy to be here today to talk about our bill that would help enforce our laws and protect the vulnerable, especially vulnerable workers who are owed money by their employers.", "Our bill also reflects that we have heard from Ontarians about the need they have, due to the changing nature of work in our province, which is also occurring throughout Canada.", "I’ve touched on a few of the basic provisions of the bill. I appreciate highly that, if passed, it will amend the Employment Standards Act to remove that $10,000 cap on recovery of wages and increase the limit of recovery from six months to two years. It would provide that additional protection for temporary help agency workers, as well as requiring employers to provide workers with a free copy of information about their employment standards rights.", "I heard a member opposite talk about how important it is. I think all of us here agree on how important it is for us to know—for all of our employees to understand what their employment standards rights are, especially when it comes to health and safety.", "They will do this when this bill passes and, if requested, translate it into their language, if it’s available from the ministry. It will enable the Ministry of Labour to require that employers complete a self-audit of their records and practices, to determine compliance with the ESA.", "I think it’s a very important provision of this bill that would provide fairness and justice to temporary foreign workers and that would amend the Employment Protection for Foreign Nationals Act—that’s the 2009 bill I mentioned earlier—and extend the protections that currently apply to live-in caregivers to all foreign employees who come to Ontario under an immigration or foreign temporary employment program.", "For those employed by temporary help agencies—we know that employment in this sector has increased in recent years—the proposed legislation builds, as I mentioned, on that 2009 legislation by ensuring temporary agency assignment employees aren’t charged fees for things like resumé writing or taking a job with an agency client, and they are not prevented from becoming permanently employed.", "If passed, Bill 18 will amend the Employment Standards Act to make temporary help agencies and their clients jointly and severally liable for certain unpaid wages owed to the agency’s employees.", "As I mentioned before, as someone who was at co-op and has children who have been through co-op programs, the bill will also amend the Occupational Health and Safety Act to extend to unpaid co-op students and other unpaid learners the same health and safety rights as paid workers have. Even if you’re a co-op student in a university, college or other program where you’re receiving educational credits, you deserve the same health and safety protections as every other worker, and that’s exactly what the government is intending to ensure with the proposed amendment. Under our bill, unpaid students, learners and trainees would be defined as workers under the OHSA and would have the same rights and duties as the paid workers they work alongside.", "Let me point to an example: They’d have the right to know about workplace hazards, the right to participate in joint health and safety committees and have safety representatives, and the right to refuse unsafe work. Unpaid learners such as co-op students would also have the same duties as paid workers. Again, as an example, they would have to work in compliance with the OHSA and regulations, operate equipment safely and report any hazards or contraventions to the employer or supervisor. These explicit obligations would enhance their accountability to the employer and other workers. As participants in co-operative education programs, co-op students, like other workers, receive basic health and safety instruction, including information on the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System before entering a workplace.", "I can only say, as a summer student who worked in hazardous situations, that I welcome this. I sometimes look back and wonder how I made it through those high school years working in environments that were clearly not safe. I think it was because I managed to find mentors who stuck by me and guided me through the dangerous situations.", "We must build and strengthen our province’s economy and businesses, but we must also protect Ontario’s most vulnerable employees. I want to take just a second to describe some of the work the Ministry of Labour is currently undertaking to protect those vulnerable workers, including the temporary foreign workers.", "This past September, as my colleague alluded to earlier, the ministry began a three-month employment standards blitz focusing on vulnerable employees. The ministry employment standards officers are conducting inspections to determine compliance with the Employment Standards Act, focusing on sectors known to hire a high proportion of vulnerable or temporary foreign workers, including restaurants, building services and personal care services—for example, hair, esthetics and massage services.", "Our inspectors are also focusing on business support services such as collection agencies, call centres and horticultural businesses like nurseries and greenhouses. Employment standards officers will check for compliance with core employment standards under the Employment Standards Act, with particular focus on public holidays, vacation pay, minimum wage, record keeping and payment of wages.", "Our government is taking major steps to fulfill its commitment to protect vulnerable employees by enhancing enforcement of the Employment Standards Act. As part of the 2013 budget, the government invested ongoing funding of $3 million for additional employment standards officers and staff.", "Our government is committed to building a more prosperous Ontario while creating the jobs of today and tomorrow and providing more opportunities for all. It’s important to remember that when we came to office, the minimum wage had been frozen for eight years straight. That was not fair to workers, who saw their cost of living increase while their wages stayed frozen. That’s why our government has increased the minimum wage by 50% since 2003. We increased it during good times and during the depths of the recession because it was the right thing to do. Ontario went from having one of the lowest minimum wages in Canada to one of the highest because that’s what hard-working families deserve." ],

As I’ve said each time I’ve stood here today, the key, absolutely, for any legislation that I look at is health and safety, so we support that wholeheartedly. Anything that is going to improve health and safety—how could we not vote for that and try to find those improvements?", "I’m supportive, of course, of making employees and employers as knowledgeable as possible. I think my colleague from Leeds–Grenville said that he certainly experienced a lot of people calling his office who don’t really understand their rights and obligations. So anything, again, that can help that, to make all of us safer, certainly is a good thing.", "He talked a lot, the member from Newmarket–Aurora, about co-op programs, and he was very supportive of the value of those and the benefits of having co-op programs. Certainly in reading this legislation originally, I have a concern, and I’ll extend it to interns as well: What happens if we actually, as a result of this legislation, because companies or businesses, or in my case—I used to be a municipal recreation director and employed a lot of people—engaged a lot of people, I should say—in co-ops. We didn’t have the budget; we didn’t have the ability to pay those students. Without the budget, you just wouldn’t offer those. So now those young students’ career opportunities are going to be missed. I have very much concern.", "Similarly, interns—I had an intern here, Domna Theodorou, a fabulous young lady. In fact, she came to me and asked for the opportunity to have some experience. She didn’t want payment. In fact, we didn’t even talk about payment. She just really was extremely wanting to be able to have that opportunity to work here. And it was great. She stayed with me longer than her actual placement of her own volition. I think that’s wonderful.", "The concern I have, really, with this bill is that there are a lot of things when they’ve combined them into an omnibus. They’re taking two pieces of legislation and combining them into one. I’m fearful. What things might just get swept through without proper debate? Have the stakeholders been widely enough consulted to ensure that everyone who is looking at this legislation truly knows—in a lot of legislation, there are unintended consequences. Have they looked at it from a rural perspective? Again, in a case like my area, are we going to lose out on co-op and internships that may provide the only opportunity for those people to get some valuable training?", "Mr. Speaker, I’m very supportive of this and look forward to it going to committee so we can scrutinize every piece before it gets put into legislation." ],

He said, “It’s the least we can do.” I agree; it is the least you can do, because I think you could do more. I think you could do a lot more. If that means making the minimum wage $12 and then tying it to the cost of living, that would be doing more.", "In my way of thinking, Speaker, I’d like to come to work every day in this chamber with the other 106 members of the Legislature and say to myself, “What’s the best we can do today? What’s the best we can do for the people of Ontario today?” Not “What’s the least we can do for the people of Ontario today?”", "He also talked about doing this in a fair and predictable manner, which is good. That’s why we as New Democrats had proposed a $12 minimum wage with annual increases but balanced by a tax reduction in the rate for small business owners, which would make it more affordable to pay the higher rate.", "I know, as I was a former municipal councillor, and the member from Newmarket–Aurora was too, if somebody came to him, a constituent came and said, “My basement is flooding;” or “I’ve got potholes on my street,” in that career, he would have said, “What’s the best we can do?” Not “What’s the least we can do to resolve those problems?” So I know his heart is in the right place. I know he wants to do more. I would hope that within his caucus, he would champion the cause for doing more for the people of Ontario, because I think we can do that and I think that’s the right thing to do, the best we can do." ],

My parents came to this country in the late 1950s. They were in their early twenties. They took whatever work they could. My mother was 23 and went to work in a dry cleaner’s in north-end Toronto and spent 18 years pressing shirts.

The one about removing the $10,000 cap on retrieval of wages is certainly something that is probably long overdue. The trouble with the bill, if there is any, is that when you combine a number of different acts and have an omnibus piece of legislation, there can be issues that you find out later.

It introduces joint and several liability between temporary help agencies and their clients from paid regular wages and overtime pay. It requires employers to provide all employees with a copy of the Ministry of Labour employment standards information in a language that they can understand. It gives the Ministry of Labour employment standards officers the authority to require employers to conduct a self-audit to determine compliance with the Employment Standards Act. And of course, the previous Bill 165—it changes the minimum wage to tie it to the Ontario consumer price index future increases.", "I would like the opportunity to speak to some of these parts of the bill. I’ll start off with the comments the minister made. He said that employees who do the work deserve to be paid, and I completely agree with that. He mentioned that it would make the Employment Standards Act apply to interns.", "That made me think of my daughter, Renee, who went to school for marketing at Guelph. She took a four-year marketing program. One summer, she got a job as an intern down on Bay Street at a marketing company. They didn’t pay her much money. To make ends meet, she took a second job a few hundred metres away at a cooking store. As it turned out, she discovered that she liked cooking a lot better than marketing. That led her to change careers and go back to George Brown College and do a chef’s course. I’m happy to say that she’s happily employed and very passionate about cooking now. Unfortunately, she’s not in this country. That’s the only problem. She’s over in London, England, working at a fancy restaurant called Le Gavroche, and very, very much has found her passion.", "In terms of the minimum wage, I think we all want to see people earning as much money as possible. It was pointed out by the critic that Ontario seems to have a much higher percentage of people earning minimum wage than other provinces. I pose the question, what do we need to get people earning more money? I’m not sure that minimum wage is the only tool. I think it has a lot more to do with skills development and giving particularly our young people, but all residents, the ability to improve their skills so they can get the jobs that are out there.", "In the last couple of weeks, I met with a business owner in the Parry Sound area: Bill Connor, who owns Connor Industries in Parry Sound. They produce Stanley boats that are shipped around the world. You see lots of them around Georgian Bay and Parry Sound. They’re quality boats that are used by the OPP and the coast guard and are shipped literally around the world. One of the main reasons he wanted to meet with me was the fact that he’s not able to fill all his orders because he can’t get enough skilled workers. In the case of building aluminum boats, that tends to be a lot of welders and other people who work in metal. It was actually affecting his business. That’s one of his biggest challenges: He’s forever training welders, and then either losing them or needing more welders. It actually affects his ability to—he’d be able to do more business and employ more people, if he could find more skilled people. These are good jobs that pay very well—much above minimum wage. I think we need to find ways to get people the skills so they can take advantage of these good jobs.", "One of the points that he brought up in the meeting: The Near North District School Board has made their capital priority for this year—and I’m pleased to see the Minister of Education here today—the JK-to-grade-12 school proposed for Parry Sound in the recent proposal.", "Bill Connor from Connor Industries said, “Can there please be a shop class at that school to get more young people interested and get them some skills so that they can become future employees at Connor Industries and stay in the Parry Sound area?” I said, “I think you’re asking at the right time, seeing as the school hasn’t been built or designed or approved.” So I would certainly make that suggestion. I think it is an opportunity to get more people those skills so they can get the good jobs.", "On the other side of the riding, I attended a session at the Almaguin high school, and they had businesses there. Again, there were a number of businesses that want to hire people but they’re having difficulty getting people with the skills. I recall that Kent Trusses was there. They needed people that knew how to run the computerized equipment used in truss manufacturing, and they’re having difficulty finding the skilled people necessary to do that.", "That makes me think of the report that was done in February of 2010 by Dr. Rick Miner, the former president of Seneca College. The title of that report was People Without Jobs, Jobs Without People. It points out that in the next few years, if we don’t—I look at it as an opportunity, but the report pointed out that by 2031, there would be one million unskilled people in Ontario without jobs, and at the same time, one million skilled positions going unfilled. So I look at that as a tremendous opportunity, a way that, if we can get those people the skills, they’re going to earn way above minimum wage and have good jobs and the ability to provide a good living for themselves and their families.", "I think that increasing minimum wage is not the only answer. Having said that, I think business likes to be able to plan. Tying the increases to the CPI does give business the opportunity to plan towards increased costs.", "I think business also wants to be treated fairly. I recently met with a company that makes firewood. The complaint of that small company was that their competitors are not charging tax on their firewood. He’s a bigger firewood company, and he’s playing by the rules, and charges the HST as he should be doing, but he says he loses all kinds of business because he’ll have someone inquiring and, “It’s this price plus HST,” and they want to do it for cash. He says, “No, I’ve got to collect the tax.” There are a lot of his competitors that aren’t. So I would say that the government has a job making sure it’s a level playing field for all the businesses so that it’s fair for them all. Of course the benefit should be that the government, which is in great need of revenue, would end up with some more revenue to help address that big $12-billion deficit.", "I guess I’d say about this legislation that I do have some concerns that it continues with the trend that government has had for many years, and that is being very, very prescriptive versus trying to set goals and trying to educate.", "As an example, it prescribes that employers must have a poster with the most recent rules, I believe, given to each employee. Sure; I don’t argue with that, but it seems awfully detail-oriented. You wouldn’t think you’d need to have quite that detail. When you talk to businesses or organizations like independent business, small business, they’ll point out that the cost of regulation is some $11 billion a year, and particularly for small businesses, which are the big job creators, I think that’s very true. If you’re a small businessperson, you cannot possibly know all the rules you’re governed by, all the laws you’re governed by. It’s just impossible. If you have three people working in your company, you’d have to spend all your time trying to learn the rules and you have no time to run your business.", "From my own experience of being in business back a few years ago now, in the resort business for 25, 30 years, I’ve seen a change, and not in a good way. I think most businesses are not out to break the rules; they want to be within the rules, but they also want to be successful in their business, make money and employ people. If they’re spending all their time trying to learn about the rules and comply with government regulations, they don’t have time and/or it’s very expensive, so it makes them uncompetitive.", "I think back to the way it formerly was when government was willing to take some risk and accept some liability on themselves. I think back to even something like applying for a septic licence to build a new septic system back about 1998 in my former resort business. At that point, I didn’t know a lot about septic systems, but I walked into the Ministry of the Environment, they gave me a form and the person there actually helped me fill out the form. Then they actually came on the site of the resort and walked the property with me. I assumed I was going to have to build some huge septic system. They pointed to an area and said, “Well, what about this area?” which was a much smaller area. “You could put a Whitby bed.” I said, “What is a Whitby bed?” They actually explained it to me and, in that case, myself and an employee ended up building the septic system ourselves. It’s still in operation and it’s still functioning. Government was helpful, willing to take some risks and actually providing assistance to you.", "To the end of my time in the resort business, when we were going to apply to build a new septic system, you had to hire a consultant just to fill out the form. There’s no way you could possibly do it. It just has become so much more complicated and the government is not willing to offer any advice, I assume because then they would be considered to be liable for that advice.", "I think back to the first time we saw a fire inspector at my past business, which was, I think, about 1976 or 1977. Before that, they just didn’t exist in the province, or didn’t exist in Muskoka anyway. The fire inspector showed up. I worked with him for about 20 years. His name was Glen Medland, and unfortunately he’s passed on now at far too young an age, but he was very helpful for me as the operator of this business. He would actually call me and say, “By the way, did you know the rules have changed? You’re going to have to put five eighths fire code gypsum up in the hallways of your lodge. You’re going to need fire doors.” He knew the business was relatively seasonal at that point, so he said, “I’ll come around and inspect in September. That way, you’ll have all winter to actually make the changes.” But he helped to educate me on what I needed to be doing. If they came around, inspected and they’d find violations, then you’d comply with them and have them done for the next season. That changed over the 20 years I worked with him in that at the end of his time, he had absolutely no leeway. He couldn’t offer suggestions. He couldn’t offer help to the businessperson who’s trying to comply by the rules. He could just come in and write violations.", "I think that’s been the tendency of government. They’re hiring lots of inspectors to find businesses in violation and give them the ticket, whereas most businesses are trying to comply with the rules. They could use some help in complying with the rules, but that’s not the way we’ve been going in my experience in recent years. So I think you could change and be much more goal oriented with the rules that we have and provide a lot more assistance to businesses that want to comply. I think it would be far more productive and cost far less for everyone in society if we did that.", "As I say, that’s not been the trend, and I think it’s disappointing. But I think education is certainly far more important than just writing the rules for how we’re going to fine you next in terms of the individual business. So it is something that I would like to see changed over time.", "How else can we create more jobs in this province? Well, we need an electricity policy that makes affordable electricity part of the goal. I mean, we just need to look at a place like Timmins: I think it was Xstrata Nickel that lost 700 good-paying jobs just a couple of years ago that moved across the border to Quebec. They’re still doing the work, but unfortunately it’s not being done in Ontario anymore because of our high energy costs. So that’s another part of the puzzle: If we want to keep good jobs here, we need to have affordable electricity prices.", "I’m concerned about Kimberly-Clark in Huntsville: a couple of hundred people employed—good jobs—making Kleenex tissue products. You know, they’ve come to me, and I’ve met with the Minister of Energy. They’re concerned with the reliability of electricity and the cost, and the fact that of all their mills doing similar work in North America, they have the highest electricity price of any of the mills. That affects their ability to compete, even within the company, for capital that’s available to expand and create more jobs that are not minimum wage jobs, but jobs that pay far above that. I think those are the sorts of things that we need to do in order to create more good-paying jobs that will provide more opportunity here in the province of Ontario.", "I did note that our critic, the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington, was okay with some of the aspects of this bill. We haven’t had it at caucus yet, so I’m sure we’ll want to do that. I think it will be important that it goes to committee, because we’ve heard people talk about unintended consequences, I don’t pretend to know all the nuances of the bill. I think it will be important to hear from people who are involved in some of the businesses that will be affected and from employees as well—both employers and employees—that they can come before committee and maybe point out things that we as legislators might not be aware of.", "It is interesting that Ontario currently does seem to have a far higher percentage of people earning minimum wage. I think that’s something we need to change and work toward changing. I don’t know whether this bill is actually the bill to make that happen, but there are some aspects of it that we will look forward to supporting. I think that’s about all the comments I have for today." ],

Usually we can find some commonalities, and in this case, we can.", "I certainly agree with the member’s comments with regard to the minimum wage versus good jobs debate. We of course support an increased minimum wage. I think ours was $12, tied to inflation. But I do agree with the member on the skilled trades piece. He references the new K-to-12 school for that riding and the importance of having tech and industrial programming, because very soon there is going to be a skilled trades gap, which is key to our economy, to our transportation file and to our infrastructure file. It’s key to our economy. We share his concerns with future generations having the skills—acquiring skills through the education system—in order to move forward and get good jobs.", "Where I don’t agree with him and his comments—specifically his comments around this piece of legislation—is providing some of the latitude for employers around workplace conditions and standards. I think that the key thing he referenced is that education is pretty much good enough. But in areas around safety, we wouldn’t have such a high injury rate in the province of Ontario if education was good enough. As I referenced earlier, our falls from heights continue to be a growing concern.", "So there are some instances where oversight and compliance are needed, and it needs to be prescriptive. It shouldn’t be optional. Safety should never be optional. The employer should never have the right to overrule in that regard. But on the skilled trades, he’s right.

We do need to go back, because the trades do provide good wages. A unionized trade or non-unionized trade, I think, is very important to the economy of this province and the buying power of those who pick up a trade.

We have a fundamental problem with that, not just in this piece of legislation, but in a lot of pieces of legislation. We’ve just gone through an election where we spent a lot of time talking about transparency, and yet I come back here on the first day of this session, and again, what we’re trying to do is to get information from the government. That shouldn’t be that hard, and yet it is.", "When you have to work that hard to get a business plan for a loan that happened three years ago, then you start to wonder, really, shouldn’t this be brought back to the Legislature to discuss?

More power should be brought back to the Legislature. We would spend a lot less time fighting to extricate information that belongs to the people of Ontario.", "He brought up another good point. If the minimum wage is indexed to the CPI, which we agree with, why wouldn’t ODSP and OW be indexed, as well? The answer to that is, because that would cost the government money, whereas increasing the minimum wage costs the employer money. In farm talk, what’s good for the goose is good for the gander. Sometimes the things that we deal with—and we deal with it in all of our constituency offices. Is anyone in this House going to tell me that the ODSP rates are high enough? They’re not. We could do much better.", "One thing that struck me in this debate, and a couple of members came at it in a couple of different ways—I don’t think we have a lot of argument with the basic premise of this legislation. We could make this a little bit better or make that a lot better, but the basic premise behind the legislation is good. But the people who are impacted most by this legislation—temporary foreign workers, people like that—there’s something they don’t have that the people in this House do. It’s called privilege. I can stand here and say I have been aggrieved, and I can make my case, and I try to occasionally. But if I’m working at an insecure job or I’m a temporary foreign worker, it doesn’t matter how great this legislation is, if I’m afraid to speak—and I don’t see anything in this legislation that is going to help that. Actually, I heard things coming from the government side that made me even more wary. I heard, “Well, we’re having a blitz.” What about the people who were missed by the blitz? If you can do a blitz and get a whole bunch of, “Oh, there’s someone who’s doing it wrong, and there’s someone who’s doing it wrong”—and again, the vast majority of employers are doing things right. I’d really like to make that clear. Blitzing is not going to help with the employer who doesn’t get blitzed who isn’t doing it right. It’s certainly not going to help those employees, because they don’t have what I’m exercising right now. They don’t have the ability to stand up and know that they won’t be punished for it by losing their jobs.", "Actually, if I don’t stand up, I’ll be punished by losing my job, but that’s a whole different ball of wax.", "It’s something I would really like to focus on and something no one has really answered, in my opinion.", "Again, I go back to the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington. He brought forward that there were personal hygiene inspectors and made light of it. I had never heard of a personal hygiene inspector.", "I do hope that there are actually enough people who are approachable, because otherwise—one of the reasons I ran for this job is because there are all kinds of pieces of legislation that sound really good in this House, that make great press releases, but that don’t work on the ground.", "I was fortunate enough to listen to the member for Parry Sound–Muskoka’s presentation, as well. He made the same point. It has been my experience that government used to be there to help, and that has fallen by the wayside. When people come to our office, it’s hard to get government to help. It’s either nothing at all, or when you push hard, then the hammer comes down. But what about the people who don’t come to our offices? That’s the part that, with this legislation, and with a lot of legislation, we really should stop and think about. Because it’s fine to pat yourself on the back and feel good that we’ve protected this insecure worker. But have we? Have we? Because they don’t have the privilege that we do. Those employers who don’t want to do things right can make sure that they don’t have those privileges. That hurts us all.", "It hurts our economy as well, because our economy, especially in the case of temporary foreign workers—they’re in the Holland Marsh; they’re also in Timiskaming–Cochrane. Why? Because as the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka said, in a lot of cases, we cannot find skilled workers to do the jobs that need to be done. In our case, in Timiskaming–Cochrane, a lot of the people who could work, who would be skilled at working in agriculture, can make more money working in a mine right now. And I don’t blame them. If I was their age, I would be working in a mine as well. So we have to bring in workers to actually get the work done.", "By far, the majority of our employers do a great job, but again, I’m not sure the help is out there to actually make sure that the employers who aren’t doing a good job get reprimanded.", "One part of this bill that I would have thought odd before I got this job: There’s a part in there about how you can go after more than six months’ wages. I’m thinking to myself, “Really?”—before I got this job, when I was an employer and before, when I worked on a farm—“Well, why would anybody work if they’re not getting paid?” But again, if you’re in a precarious position—and now that I’m an MPP, I deal with cases like this in my office. So it has changed my perspective incredibly. Hopefully, we can change a lot more people’s perspective incredibly.", "On the issue of jobs, just raising minimum wage isn’t going to create jobs, and having had the pleasure of being here the whole afternoon, I’ve heard a couple of nice points. I’ve heard a couple of times that the minimum wage was frozen, and since this government has been in power, we went from the lowest minimum wage to the highest minimum wage. Congratulations. We also went from the lowest hydro costs to the highest hydro costs in the country. And if you’re going to tell me that that’s not true, then you tell me why the companies in my riding like Resolute Forest Products, like Xstrata in Timmins, just north of my riding—that ore is still being processed. It’s being processed in Quebec, where the electricity costs are a lot cheaper.", "If you’re going to create jobs, let’s talk about the real issues. Minimum wage is one of them. But if you’re going to trumpet that the minimum wage is that much higher, let’s look at everything that is that much higher.", "Another issue is education. I’ve been listening this whole afternoon—and if you haven’t figured it out yet, I don’t have any notes. I’m kind of just going off the cuff, because I wasn’t planning to speak today. The member from Parry Sound–Muskoka talked about a shop class. We have in TDSS, Timiskaming District Secondary School, and I believe the Premier came to see it, a high school excellence class in agriculture; and it’s a great program. Right where I live, it’s primarily an agricultural area, and this gives students a crash course in stuff like how to change a bearing. Not too many people in this room could probably change a bearing, but those kids can, and that’s a big part of agriculture. You can have a half-million dollar machine, but if a bearing goes, it’s sitting there. If no one knows how to change it, it’s sitting there. It’s little things like that.", "I want to go back to one thing, and I think it’s really important: I find it an incredible privilege to be able to stand here and speak my mind on behalf of my colleagues, especially with this bill. We’re talking about people who don’t have that privilege. So we’re going to have to find a way, when this bill goes to committee and when it passes, to actually make it work on the ground, because if we don’t make legislation that works for people on the ground, we’re never going to be as successful as we want to be.", "Good legislation and good legislators: It’s more than putting out a fancy press release. I like the titles. Stronger Workplaces for a Stronger Economy Act: great title. But it’s more than just the title. It’s about making programs that actually work.", "I’m going to go back to the Minister of Northern Development. A program that actually works: tile drainage in northern Ontario. There is infrastructure—you want to talk about local food? You put tile drainage in the ground that will last for 100 years, and regardless of who farms that ground, it will make a huge difference. The people who don’t have tile drainage in northern Ontario this year are not going to get a crop off. That’s a great program. I’d like to commend the minister. I bet you he didn’t think I was ever going to do that, but I’d like to commend the minister for really pushing that program. The farmers in Timiskaming–Cochrane have been pushing that for 20 years. That’s the kind of program that makes a huge difference. That’s infrastructure; that’s bricks and mortar and tile.", "But for this type of legislation to make a difference—I know I’m being repetitive, but it’s an important point—it has got to make a difference to people on the street. It has got to make a difference to people in the Holland Marsh. It has got to make a difference to people in Timiskaming Shores right now, or in Evanturel township, who are milking cows. It has got to impact—it has got to be available to them. If we’re successful at doing that, it will be a successful piece of legislation." ],

He was a dairy farmer for 10 years.", "I still recall all the skills he had to learn in that business of being a farmer—and he was 20 when he started—thinking of things like how to weld when the combine broke, and you’re right in the middle of trying to harvest. Of course, I still remember having to drive him to the hospital because he didn’t use the safety goggles when he did weld his combine back together, so perhaps the school would have been good for him for some of the skills you need—or how to deliver a calf, or how to fix various broken equipment when it would break right when you really needed it, and you had very little time to actually get the job done. There certainly is a huge variety of skills required.", "Coming back to some of his other points, I certainly believe that, with most things that government does, there needs to be some flexibility for the inspectors, not in the case of safety necessarily, but in lots of other areas. It’s not all black and white; there are grey areas. You need some inspectors who have common sense and who are willing—and it should be the policy of the government to help educate employees, employers and businesses so they can meet the objectives of the government and not be so much about being the police.", "I see I’m out of time in my comments.

It also provides notice to those employers who may not be doing the job right so they get it right next time. They have been successful. So we’ll hope to be able to continue that.

I’m very proud to have the opportunity to speak today in support of the government’s plan to modernize Ontario’s child care and early years system.", "In December of last year, our government introduced Bill 143, the Child Care Modernization Act. Unfortunately, the bill’s debate in this House was cut short, and it died on the order paper when the Legislative Assembly was dissolved for a general election. But I can state unequivocally that this government remains committed to that groundbreaking bill that will transform Ontario’s child care and early years programs and services to ensure that children in this great province have the best possible start in life. That is why I’m proud to rise in this House today to discuss this important piece of legislation.", "Bill 10, if passed, will modernize our child care and early years system, and replace the outdated legislation that currently governs child care in this province. It is really outdated. It was first tabled in the 1940s and hasn’t been amended since the 1980s.", "This new act will make our system more responsive to the needs of parents and children and better reflect the realities of our modern world. It will ensure Ontario’s families have access to safe and high-quality care that gives children the head start they need for lifelong success. If passed, it will also strengthen the oversight in the child care sector.", "Speaker, this proposed legislation is truly transformative and will change child care and early years programs and services in this province for the better. It will build on the improvements we have already made, and I’m proud to say that full-day kindergarten is now available to every four- and five-year-old attending publicly funded schools in Ontario." ],

  "text" : [ "Exactly. We need to celebrate the full introduction of full-day kindergarten.", "That means that this year, the FDK program will benefit approximately 265,000 children province-wide. In addition, we have a new child care funding formula in place that is based on current demographic and population trends.", "We also have an Ontario Early Years Policy Framework. This framework sets out a vision and strategic direction for early years programs and services—that is, for children from birth up to six years of age, in the earliest years of their lives.", "Despite these improvements to the child care and early years system, these services are currently governed by a patchwork of rules and regulations which can create confusion for families. In fact, the legislation that currently regulates the child care sector, the Day Nurseries Act, hasn’t fundamentally changed since the 1980s. But as we all know, the world around us has certainly changed. These rules and regulations are simply outdated, and we need to better meet the needs of children and families in our modern world. That’s why the proposed Child Care Modernization Act is a top priority for our government.", "I’m pleased to be in the House today to speak to my fellow members about the Child Care Modernization Act, which I introduced as Bill 10 during our summer session this year. Bill 10, if passed, will repeal and replace the outdated Day Nurseries Act, the legislation that currently governs child care in Ontario, as well as amend a number of other acts. It will amend the Education Act, the Early Childhood Educators Act, and the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act.", "If passed, the Child Care Modernization Act would support the government in working with partners to establish a system of integrated, responsive, high-quality and accessible child care and early years programs that support parents and families. It would improve safety and foster learning, development, health and well-being of children. It would provide a framework for the provision of child care and early years services and establish a licensing and compliance framework for child care.", "It would set out powers related to the funding of child care and early years programs and services, and facilitate and support local planning and implementation of child care and early years services. It would provide access to information to support parents in making informed decisions about child care options, and improve our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of child care and early years programs.", "Another important part of this proposed legislation would facilitate and support the local planning and implementation of child care and early years programs and services. It would reflect the leadership role that consolidated municipal service managers and district social services administration boards currently play as local service system managers in the delivery of child care and early years programs.", "It would also give consolidated municipal service managers and district social services administration boards the flexibility to respond to local circumstances in a manner that best serves the needs of families in their communities. It would set out duties to co-operate with local partners to support the well-being of children. This allows local partners to best serve the needs of families in their own communities.", "In addition, Speaker, a key objective of Bill 10 is to improve oversight in the child care sector. This is because the safety of Ontario’s children is of paramount importance. To strengthen oversight, our government would have a range of new enforcement tools to protect the province’s children and safeguard their well-being. These new enforcement tools would apply to both licensed and unlicensed providers and include the authority to issue administrative penalties, which could be up to $100,000 per infraction, and the authority to immediately stop a child care provider from operating in circumstances where children’s safety is at risk. It would give us the ability to issue compliance orders and enforce rules in the unlicensed sector and increase the maximum penalties for successful prosecution of offences in the court system from $2,000 up to a maximum of $250,000. To put this in context, the only enforcement tool that we have right now under the existing Day Nurseries Act is to take a non-compliant operator to court, and even if we win in court, the maximum fine is $2,000. This gives us a significant improvement in terms of our ability to enforce the law.", "Additional measures to support the safety of children include the prevention of individuals from providing child care if they have been previously convicted of certain crimes. This also applies to individuals who have been convicted of certain offences under this proposed act and individuals whose membership has been revoked from a regulatory body, such as the College of Early Childhood Educators, over professional misconduct. It would also require certain people who, in the course of their employment, have reasonable grounds to suspect an imminent threat to a child’s health or safety when in care to actually report this to the Ministry of Education. Currently, there is no requirement for professionals who may be aware of a problematic situation to actually report it to our inspectors, so this is a new requirement in law.", "Speaker, it goes without saying that child care plays a critical role for Ontario’s families, communities and the health of our economy. This proposed legislation shows our government is committed to building on our success and safeguarding the well-being of our province’s children. Bill 10 includes measures to help parents make informed decisions about child care options by ensuring that parents understand whether a provider is licensed or unlicensed and providing parents with information about whether a provider has contravened the act.", "These measures would include prohibiting unlicensed providers from using such terms as “child care centre” or “licensed child care” or “licensed daycare.” It would prohibit unlicensed providers from claiming to be licensed explicitly or by implication. It would require unlicensed providers to disclose their unlicensed status to parents and retain proof of such disclosures. It would require licensed providers to post a licence or any other required information or signage in a visible location, and it would prohibit copies from being made of those licences unless required by law. It would require people who are paid for child care services to provide a receipt for payment if requested by the parents.", "It would require the Ministry of Education to publish information about contraventions of the proposed act or its regulations, including publishing compliance orders, protection orders, administrative penalties and convictions, and it would prevent any child care provider from stopping a parent from accessing their child or the child care premises, unless the provider believes the parent has no right to access the child or may be dangerous or disruptive. Parents want to know their children are in a safe, nurturing environment, and parents need to know that the government can intervene if their child is at risk.", "In addition to expanding the government’s powers of oversight, the proposed legislation would also increase access to licensed home-based care. This means additional spaces in home-based settings. Under the proposed act, the number of children permitted in licensed home-based care would be at least one child greater than in unlicensed settings. That means that the number would increase from five, which, as I say, is the current limit, to six in licensed home-based care. This would translate to additional child care spaces in licensed home-based settings. More specifically, this means that if all current licensed home child care providers took on one additional space, approximately 6,000 new child care spaces would be created. This is another example of how Bill 10 would help the families and children of Ontario.", "In addition, we recognize the role that unlicensed child care providers play in offering child care options for families. Under the proposed legislation, licensed home-based providers and unlicensed providers would need to follow the same rules on age restrictions. In the case of unlicensed providers, they would still be allowed to care for a maximum of five children; however, unlicensed providers would have to follow the same rules as licensed providers and count their own children under the age of six toward the maximum number of children permitted in their care. This also means that unlicensed providers can care for no more than two children under the age of two. This restriction is consistent with research on brain development and safety provisions needed to protect young children.", "The proposed legislation also prohibits a person from providing unlicensed child care at more than one location. I would also note that Bill 10 includes the regulatory authority to further reduce the number of children unlicensed providers can care for in the future, if it makes sense to do so.", "All of these measures are intended as incentives for unlicensed providers to become part of the licensed sector. We want to encourage unlicensed caregivers to join a licensed home care agency, and we want to help increase access to licensed home-based options.", "Speaker, this proposed legislation, if passed, would also help parents make informed decisions about their child’s care by clarifying what programs require a licence and what programs are exempt. Certain types of care, such as care provided by relatives, in-home nannies and babysitters, would fall largely outside the scope of the proposed legislation. Camps that operate for no more than 13 weeks for children who are junior kindergarten age would be exempt. Private schools serving children who are junior kindergarten age and up, and other recreational programs that are primarily aimed at providing recreation or sports activities, or cultural or language activities—all those other programs for school-age and up children—would be excluded. They are not primarily daycare, and they would therefore not be required to meet the licensed child care provisions.", "In addition, certain types of child care that meet specific criteria would not require a licence. This includes unlicensed child care, which we’ve already talked about a lot, and, subject to regulations, authorized recreation programs for children six years and under. We do recognize that there are all kinds of things like swimming classes or gymnastics classes or various forms of things for little toddlers that are primarily recreation, and there is no need for them to be treated as if they are child care. However, our goal is to place an emphasis on the standards and protections of the licenced system for children under four years of age, as they are the most vulnerable group, and allow some flexibility for older children, where parents can make informed choices about their child’s care.", "In addition to clarifying when a licence is required, the proposed legislation also sets out criteria for individuals applying for a licence, to support high-quality and viable child care options. The grounds for refusing, not renewing, or revoking a licence would include:", "—the applicant is not competent;", "—past conduct indicates the applicant will not operate within the law;", "—the accommodation does not comply with requirements;", "—the applicant has made a false statement;", "—there has been no change in circumstances where a licence was previously revoked or refused;", "—advice from a service manager, First Nation or local authority indicates that the licence would authorize child care in an area inconsistent with the local service plan; or, finally,", "—a failure to comply with a protection order and/or prescribed requirements, or a failure to pay an administrative penalty which has been previously proposed.", "Any of these would be grounds for refusing, not renewing, or revoking a licence.", "The proposed legislation also includes provisions related to licensing. These provisions would include:", "—the ability for child care providers to appeal decisions to the Licence Appeal Tribunal;", "—the authority to set out terms and conditions of a licence;", "—the requirement to notify an applicant or licensee and parents that a licence has been refused or revoked. That is to say, if we refuse renewal or revoke a licence, we would want to let the parents who are currently in that situation know that the licence is being removed, so that the parents understand that the status of the setting has changed.", "The provisions in the act also include the ability to issue a provisional licence so a provider can operate under the condition that violations are being addressed within a set period of time. What often happens during the renewal process for a licence is that an inspector will note that there is a small variation from the licensing requirements. In that case, we would simply issue a provisional licence while the operator comes into compliance with the rules.", "We want providers to clearly understand when a child care licence is required, and we want it to be clear when a licence will be granted or renewed and when it can be refused or revoked.", "Building on these licensing requirements, another way we can increase oversight in the child care sector is by empowering inspectors. If passed, this legislation would allow for the appointment of inspectors who are employees of the province. The legislation would set out the powers and duties of inspectors, including the authority to enter a location without a warrant in certain circumstances.", "One of the issues that has been raised with the current Day Nurseries Act is that if there is a complaint received and the Ministry of Education inspector goes to that site—typically, a home-based site—if the owner of the home won’t let them in the door, there actually isn’t anything that the inspector, under the Day Nurseries Act, can do about the fact that they’re being refused entry.", "Under the new legislation, if passed, inspectors would be able to enter without a warrant if the provider is operating under the authority of a licence, including home child care associated with a licensed home child care agency. That is to say that inspectors can automatically enter the premises when you’re licensed or, in the case of unlicensed premises, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the proposed act or regulations are not being complied with, including unlicensed child care in an individual’s home, as I’ve said.", "As employees of the province, inspectors would also have other powers and duties. These powers and duties would include the powers to examine records, demand documents, and remove and/or copy records. That’s often got to do with the records of how many children were on site, when, under what circumstances and for how long. The powers and duties would include using data storage equipment on the premises to take photos or video recordings and question people on matters relevant to the inspection. The inspector would be able to request criminal reference checks from a licensee or persons who have applied for a licence, their employees, a person who provides home care, and persons where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an individual is prohibited from providing child care. There would also be a requirement to provide a report to the child care provider.", "So whether it is creating new enforcement tools, increasing access to licensed care, increasing oversight or clarifying when a licence is required, this proposed legislation is very necessary. It is necessary to modernize the child care and early years system in Ontario and it is necessary to ensure parents have access to a responsive, high-quality and accessible child care and early years system.", "I should also mention Bill 10 contains some minor amendments that are largely technical in nature. These amendments do not diverge from the original scope or intent of the proposed legislation, but one amendment I would like to mention relates to the extension of the Ontario education number to post-secondary institutions. I should also note that this bill already—the Ontario education number is the ID number that is assigned to all elementary and secondary students in Ontario. The previous child care bill and this bill both include the extension of the use of the OEN, the Ontario education number, into licensed child care settings—that is, we would begin to issue the OEN when children first enter licensed child care, which means we can track them through child care on into elementary and secondary. What’s new in this version, in Bill 10, is the ability to extend the use of the Ontario education number to post-secondary institutions.", "This was previously part of Bill 151, the Strengthening and Improving Government Act, which died on the order paper in the last Parliament. What we have done is, because we were already dealing with the extension of the OEN into the preschool set, we’ve also moved in amendments that extend the use of the OEN, the Ontario education number, to the post-secondary set so that we can now be able to track students as they graduate from high school and move on into post-secondary, either college, university or training settings.", "This amendment would actually provide the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities with the authority to link a student’s post-secondary data with their kindergarten to grade 12 data. This K to 12 data is already collected by the Ministry of Education, but the post-secondary sector doesn’t have access, and vice versa; so this improves the coordination between ministries. It will enable us to follow a child on their journey through school. From birth to adulthood, we can evaluate a student’s academic progress through various paths that they may choose to take and through various locations around the province. We’ll get a more complete picture of how our education system is doing in terms of preparing our students for the future.", "But this transformative legislation goes even further. It builds upon the existing requirements for schools to offer before- and after-school programs for four- and five-year-olds in full-day kindergarten, where there is sufficient demand from the community. If passed, this proposed bill would extend before- and after-school programs for children aged six to 12. To support this, in addition to repealing and replacing the outdated Day Nurseries Act, Bill 10 would also amend the Education Act.", "The proposed amendment to the Education Act would place a duty on school boards to ensure that programs are offered for children six to 12 years old—this is before and after school—where there is sufficient parental demand. This would enable boards to offer developmentally responsive before- and after-school programs, either directly or through a third-party provider. It would build on the success of full-day kindergarten and it would help meet the needs of children as they grow and progress through school.", "In addition to amending the Education Act, this legislation would also amend the Early Childhood Educators Act. These proposed amendments are based on feedback we received last year as part of a five-year statutory review of the Early Childhood Educators Act, which happened to coincide with the development of the Child Care Modernization Act, so we rolled it all into one bill—the outcome of the review of the Early Childhood Educators Act.", "The proposed amendments to the Early Childhood Educators Act include clarifying the requirements for registration as a member of the college of ECEs. This means mandatory membership for all qualified persons working within a defined scope of practice. It provides the college with the authority to accredit ECE programs in post-secondary institutions and other bodies, and to accredit ongoing education progress, strengthening information-sharing and reporting between the college of ECEs, employers and the ministry to support enforcement and oversight. So these proposed changes to the ECE act would help the College of Early Childhood Educators protect the public interest, and the amendments would enhance the college’s ability to support our common goals for child care and the early years system. These are the key areas of the proposed legislation.", "Another essential part of this legislation is that it reflects valuable input from our stakeholders. In 2012 we received over 400 submissions during our consultation period from municipalities, child care providers, First Nations, child care advocates and other child care and early years partners, and, of course, from parents. We wanted to hear directly from stakeholders, and they also wanted to be heard. They are the caregivers, the families, the communities and the advocates that play an essential role in the care of Ontario’s children. Speaker, we listened to our stakeholders. We continue to value their input, and we’ve heard what they were asking for. Without their feedback, this bill would be incomplete, and we thank them again for their valuable input.", "Without a number of other programs and measures our government has already put in place, our plans for modernizing the child care and early years sector would also be incomplete. Therefore, it’s worthwhile mentioning some important changes we have already undertaken to complement the proposed legislation. They are all part of a comprehensive package our government has put together to help give Ontario’s children a great head start and safeguard their well-being.", "In line with our goals to protect children, I would like to make everyone aware of one particular commitment that we made last year which we have honoured. We pledged to create a searchable registry of verified complaints about unlicensed child care providers. In August, the Ministry of Education launched this online tool, and it is available to anyone through our ministry’s website. It provides people with confirmed information about unlicensed providers who have violated the current Day Nurseries Act. This searchable registry has also been paired with a toll-free telephone number. The telephone number allows people to report alleged complaints regarding unlicensed providers and inquire about verified complaints against unlicensed providers which have been noted on the website.", "As a supplement to this registry, we are also establishing a dedicated enforcement unit to follow up on complaints and information relating to unlicensed child care providers.", "We want to keep Ontario’s children safe and hold violators accountable. The registry, toll-free number and our new dedicated enforcement unit are all ways we’re improving oversight of the child care and early years systems, and Bill 10 will help us build on this and go even further.", "Speaker, I’ve outlined why we need this legislation, what it will do and how it will help improve child care and early years services in our great province. That’s why I encourage all members here today, regardless of party, to support the Child Care Modernization Act. Ontario’s children and families cannot wait any longer.", "The Child Care Modernization Act is transformative, and it will build on the proven success of our education, child care and early years systems. It will position Ontario as a future leader in these essential areas, and it will eliminate the problems caused by the current patchwork of rules and regulations.", "It’s critical that we pass this bill quickly, so I look forward to the support of all members in this House on this very important piece of legislation, and I look forward to continuing the great work we have already done to modernize child care and early years services in Ontario. By passing this important bill, we can deliver on a promise that will benefit everyone in the province and contribute to our future prosperity. Without question, we need a child care and early years system that gives children the best possible start in life, and the Child Care Modernization Act will help us to do that.", "Thank you, Speaker, and I will now turn things over to my parliamentary assistant." ],

As well, Mason, who is my son Calvin’s son, is two years old, too. My grandchildren are very special to me. I wish I had more time to spend with them, Speaker, but I’m very proud to be here to speak to this bill and make sure that it passes through the House very quickly.", "This morning, you had the opportunity to listen to the minister, who spoke a great deal about the bill, and I’m very pleased to continue that discussion. If passed, Bill 10 will modernize our child care and early years system. It will replace the outdated legislation that currently governs child care in this province. This proposed legislation, as I said earlier, is transformative. By changing child care and early years programs and services in this province, it will change them for the better. It’s part of our multi-year strategy for modernizing child care and early years systems across the province.", "Another part of this strategy has been our Ontario Early Years Policy Framework. This has guided and is guiding our collective approach to early years programs and services for children and families. Most recently we released How Does Learning Happen? Ontario’s Pedagogy for the Early Years. This document was inspired by a shared desire to build a common approach to guide pedagogy and child development. This resource will help guide learning and development in child care and early years settings. It will help ensure coherence across those early years settings, and it will also help to strengthen the quality of our early years programs and services all across Ontario.", "We know from extensive research that experiences in a child’s earliest years have an extraordinary and long-lasting impact on their learning, their development and their overall well-being. That is why, Speaker, we have an ambitious vision for early years programs and services for children from birth up to six years of age.", "Perhaps the boldest and most recent example of our great progress is the province-wide rollout of full-day kindergarten. This was a major milestone for education in this great province. Full-day kindergarten was five years in the making, and we are tremendously proud of this achievement.", "In the fall of 2009, the then education minister and now Premier of Ontario, the Honourable Kathleen Wynne, announced plans for this innovative program. There was to be an entire day of early learning that would make Ontario a leader in North America. I can proudly say that this ground-breaking program is now available to every four- and five-year-old in Ontario’s publicly funded schools. This represents the biggest transformation our education system has seen in a generation, and with more than $1.5 billion in capital funding to date, it is also the single most significant investment we’ve made in education in an entire generation.", "The encouraging news is that we know it is already paying dividends. A recent study showed that students who attend the two-year full-day kindergarten program are better prepared for grade 1. It also showed that their personal and social development was accelerated. The evidence is already clear: Full-day kindergarten is giving our children a great head start in life, and it is giving them the confidence and trust to enter and succeed in school. Without a doubt, full-day kindergarten represents the next step on a continuum of learning for Ontario’s children. But as we have said, we need to set our sights even higher and even further ahead to maximize a child’s potential in their earliest years.", "As both the minister and I have outlined, ambitious plans for the modernization of the child care and early years system are already in motion, and they are an essential part of our broader plan for the education system as a whole. This plan is laid out in our renewed vision for education, Achieving Excellence.", "Last fall we sought advice from experts, thought leaders, educators, parents, students and researchers, as well as business and the not-for-profit sector. These consultations proved invaluable as we calibrated our long-term aspirations and goals for education in Ontario for children and students from birth to adulthood.", "Thus far, our renewed vision for education has received an overwhelmingly positive response, and our top priority is to work with our education partners to realize the vision’s four key goals: achieving excellence, ensuring equity, promoting well-being and enhancing public confidence. These goals were based on feedback from our partners across the province, including students, parents, business, community organizations and much more. The vision emphasizes working with non-traditional partners like religious groups and community health agencies, which often have existing resources to help deliver services and learning programs. We will also work with the business sector as well as research and innovation. The relationships we’ve established through the consultation process will be invaluable. Of course, we’ve already made progress in a number of key areas, and we are already committed to making our vision a reality.", "As I mentioned earlier, this plan for achieving excellence closely mirrors our parallel goals for transforming the child care and early years sector. Our renewed vision for education and our vision for early learning are born from the same guiding principle: to give children the best possible start and to help them reach their full potential so they can achieve lifelong success. This is good public policy for Ontario’s children, and it is good for Ontario’s future prosperity.", "Mr. Speaker, when we look at Ontario’s child care and early years system, we can honestly say it has served us well. But the fact remains that it hasn’t fundamentally changed since the 1980s, and yet our world has changed dramatically over the last 30 years. I can hardly remember what I was doing when I was 21 years old, 30 years ago.", "That is why we need the new Child Care Modernization Act, and that is why we need this important piece of legislation to pass quickly. It will modernize and build a high-quality system that is seamless and more responsive to parents’ needs.", "This has been our government’s commitment all along. In the speech from the throne, we committed to a more comprehensive and integrated child care and early years system. In our 2011 and 2014 election platforms, we pledged to modernize Ontario’s child care system, as well as ensuring that schools had before- and after-school programs for children aged six to 12 once full-day kindergarten was fully implemented.", "In the summer of 2012, we held public consultations on our proposed vision through the release of the discussion paper Modernizing Child Care in Ontario. In January 2013, we released our Ontario Early Years Policy Framework.", "Mr. Speaker, Ontario is recognized around the world for our education system. The proposed Child Care Modernization Act is another example of how far we’ve come. But we are also on the leading edge of groundbreaking change. While our child care and early years system has served us well for a long time, it is governed by a mix of rules and regulations, and it no longer reflects the realities of our modern world.", "We have clearly outlined why we need this legislation. We have explained not only what it will do, but also how it will improve the lives of children right across this great province.", "We are encouraging all members of this House to support the Child Care Modernization Act because Ontario’s children and families cannot wait any longer. They need a system that is responsive to their needs. They need a system that better reflects the realities of today. They need us to strengthen oversight in the child care sector, and they need better access to safe, modern care that gives children what they need most.", "The Child Care Modernization Act is transformative, and it is a logical and necessary step for our education, child care and early years system. With this bill, Ontario will be a leader in these essential areas, and we will solve the problems caused by the current patchwork of rules and regulations governing the sector. That’s why it’s imperative that we pass this bill as soon as possible.", "Mr. Speaker, we are looking to all members of this House for their unwavering support on this important piece of legislation. We look forward to building on our great work to modernize child care and early years services in Ontario.

Of course, they made it sound like it was the most perfect bill that was ever created in the history of Ontario. Now I hear the minister and the parliamentary assistant both saying that this bill should be passed very quickly. I can’t agree at all with that.

I want an opportunity for this bill to travel in the winter recess, plain and simple. There are a lot of people who know nothing about this bill. The people who are finding out about it know that there will be a major impact financially and we will lose child care spaces in the province of Ontario. It’s that simple.", "So I’d ask the minister right now to bear with us and make sure that we have good debate on this bill in the House, and that means all members will have an opportunity, but more importantly, that we’ll have an all-party bill travel in the winter recess.

For us, the idea that there would be a strengthened regulatory framework, an increase in licensed care—these are very positive things.", "You may well be aware of situations in your own riding. I certainly am in mine, where I have dealt with parents who are extraordinarily anxious about the daycare or child care opportunities and situations they have to face. I’ve had parents say to me, “My child is in unlicensed, unsupervised care. I don’t have any choice. If I’m going to work, that’s all that’s available.” But I want a sense that that process is overseen. I’ve also talked to parents whose children were in unlicensed care and who came across some very serious problems with the treatment of their child and made it very clear to me that in their minds, a lack of government oversight was a critical failing in this province.", "Speaker, this bill has got to be examined very closely in committee. There are issues that come out in terms of the ratio of caregivers or early childhood educators to children. There is certainly concern in the child care community about the regulations that came forward changing those ratios within the last 12 months. Speaker, when we go into committee on this bill, and I believe it will go to committee one way or the other, I think we need to look at the broader question of how we look after our children and how we ensure that parents have proper care for them during the day." ],

Who possibly could object to their child care providers being licensed?", "In my school, we are fortunate enough to have the Y daycare right in the building.

I fully agree with my PC colleague from Simcoe North with regard to how imperative it is for this particular bill to be examined thoroughly, to go to committee and then be sent across the province and garner input, because as I look at this bill it seems to be the flavour of the day for this government to be incorporating many, many different bills into one bill. A colleague of mine, yesterday, was talking about how there may be aspects of a bill that we agree with but other aspects of a bill that we want to challenge. We need to look at and be very careful in how we go about this because, in fact, when we look at this particular bill, it’s incorporating probably close to 13 different acts. I’ve never seen a bill so thick in my stay here at the Ontario Legislature. I’m concerned about that because some things will fall through the cracks. We have to carefully examine just how important it is for us as legislators to ensure that all stakeholders are looked after in this particular aspect.", "I look at it and I’m concerned about the fact that, yes, there are some unlicensed daycare centres out there, but in fact this bill is probably going to affect close to 70,000 child care providers in the province and roughly 350,000 people in Ontario. That’s a lot of people. My concern is with these child care providers, these daycare centres: What’s going to happen to them? They’re going to shut them down. They’re trying to talk about how important it is for employment, to increase employment and get people back to work, and in fact, with this bill, it’s actually shutting down daycare centres and forcing people to close the doors and be out of work. I have a very serious concern. So let’s get this thing into committee and let’s get it in front of stakeholders throughout the province." ],

Having those children, our children and grandchildren, attend daycare of any kind, we want it to be the very best.", "There’s one thing I want to point out, though. It’s nice to have these comprehensive omnibus kinds of bills that cover everything, but really, in the end, what’s important is that most parents, by far the vast majority of parents, know what’s best for their own children. They know what’s best for their children and the kind of daycare they leave them at or the kind of school they attend and the kinds of teachers they have. I know literally thousands and thousands of my constituents, and I would trust their judgment against the judgment of some provincial legislation. There are some cases where we add all these regulations and we add a lot more legislation; however, in the end, it’s really the parents who know best, by far the vast majority, because their children are the most precious things in their lives.", "With that being said, I do want to thank the ministry, because they did offer me, and I took them up on the fact that we could do the briefing.

I want to make sure that they are treated fairly, and if it means more licensing, if it means more oversight, they are there for us.", "This is not just about agencies and big brothers; this is about a mom with a couple of kids staying at home and looking after two of her neighbours’ children. We want to make sure that they are all treated fairly. I heard both the minister and the parliamentary assistant say, “Oh, this has got to be passed quickly.” Well, come on. These bills have been around for, as someone said, 40 or 50 years in some cases. Surely this is not an urgent matter to pass before this House recesses at Christmastime.

I hold a BA and master’s in education and have just had my first child.", "“I decided to stay home and care for him myself for a few reasons. The cost of daycare is prohibitive. As teaching work is very difficult to come by in Ottawa I am reduced to supply work (if you can get on the list), working in a private school (very low paying) or working in a daycare centre (even lower paying). After paying for my son to attend daycare, I would be making the equivalent of $5 per hour. It seems ridiculous that after eight years of university this is what I am worth.", "“Therefore starting a home-based daycare business seemed logical to me. I offer an exceptional service, I am very well qualified, police checked, CPR trained and also have professional nanny training and experience from before my teaching career. I currently care for two babies plus my own son and a 5-year-old boy. The parents in my daycare are very happy with the service I provide and are very worried about any changes Bill 10 may cause.", "“I have calls and emails weekly from parents trying to place infants. What I don’t have is much interest in placing older children. If Bill 10 is passed and I and all the other daycare providers have to ask a parent of a baby to leave, where are all these babies going to go? If I can’t make a living not only will the children I care for require a space but so will my son, so that I can work full-time. Bill 10 threatens to destroy my income and negatively impact my current clients. It won’t improve safety as parents will be forced to send their children to unscrupulous providers who don’t follow the rules anyway.", "“Please put a stop to this,", "“Sincerely,” a young lady from the Ottawa area.", "I’ve got a number of them, and I’ll read others as examples, as we go through the one-hour debate.", "I’ve been dealing more recently with the Coalition of Independent Childcare Providers of Ontario. They’re based out of Ottawa. They’re growing rapidly in municipalities across the province, in opposition to Bill 10. It’s one of the reasons I wanted to make sure that these people did have a chance to speak, other than by emails to me—to actually be able to go to a committee hearing in Kitchener or London or wherever it may be and have an opportunity to speak to their concerns on this bill.", "This is a bill that is very important, as the minister has said, as the parliamentary assistant has said, and I think it’s important that we get it right. I think it was the member from Chatham who said that it’s a very thick bill. I don’t care about that, as long as the bill makes a lot of sense. I want to make sure that it’s sensible for the young people in our province and for those we treasure the most: our children and grandchildren.", "I want to talk a little bit about the Coalition of Independent Childcare Providers of Ontario. It was founded to voice the grave concerns that thousands of parents and independent child care providers across Ontario have about Bill 10, the Child Care Modernization Act; specifically, the proposed reductions for the number and ages of children that independent child care providers can care for.", "I’m going to call them CICPO. “While CICPO is in full support of improving child care in Ontario, there are two major issues with this bill that must be brought to the attention of Ontario families. The fact is that, should it pass, Ontario families will face a child care crisis of enormous proportions. Right now only 22% of Ontario’s children are in licensed care, while family members and independent child care providers care for the remaining 78%. In real numbers, approximately 350,000 children are cared for by independent child care providers in Ontario. CICPO conservatively estimates that 140,000 of the 350,000 current spaces will be lost due to forced reduction of spaces and daycare closures. In fact, some spaces are already lost. We have reports that some providers have already terminated their clients and closed their doors, seeking employment elsewhere in anticipation of the bill passing. The remaining 210,000 spaces will come at a premium, as those parents whose providers work within the proposed new limits will have to face a fee hike of as much as 40%. Promises by the education minister of an additional 6,000 licensed spots are not only theoretical but will do nothing to stem the tide of this crisis. Furthermore, decreasing accessibility will only contribute to an underground market. Care will be in such high demand that parents will be more likely to accept substandard care arrangements.”", "Mr. Speaker, I’ve got a real problem with that particular part of it, because we don’t want to limit the number of people we have now and then have an even further decline in the number of people who are actually providing that service.", "“Secondly, this bill does not address individual licensing of home daycare providers. ICPs are not unlicensed by choice. No individual home care provider can obtain a licence in Ontario, as the government only provides licensing to agencies and centres. Those providers affiliated within an agency are working within their agency’s licence, not their own. However, instituting a registry or licensing of all home daycare providers would ensure that all providers have current CPR and first aid and police background checks.” I think that’s a very important amendment that has to be made to this particular bill. “Every provider would be open to inspection by the Ministry of Education to ensure that they are in compliance with the law and health and safety regulations. Licensing would allow for 100% government oversight rather than relying on the public to report noncompliance.”", "And here is one other very significant benefit: “ICPs would be able to provide care for the thousands of children currently on subsidized wait lists. As of December 2013, there were almost 17,000 children on the subsidy wait list in Toronto alone. Clearly, the licensed sector does not have the capacity to meet the needs of Ontario families as we speak. Unfortunately too few families and providers are aware of this bill and its repercussions.” Again, that’s why I want it to go to committee.", "“Education Minister Sandals states that the bill will strengthen the safety and quality of child care options for families. With no data to substantiate her argument, the minister has repeatedly alleged that ICP care is unsafe across the board. While CICPO has confirmed the ministry is undertaking no analysis regarding the safety of ICP care, our coalition has. Using a cohort of zero to four years of age, CICPO has gathered information from the Ontario Coroner’s Office reports of deaths of children in the care of ICPs and population reports from Stats Canada over the period of 2009 to 2013.", "“With the above data, CICPO found that the five-year mortality rate to children in the care of an ICP operating within the current regulations is 0.000017%. As Minister Sandals will not provide equivalent data for children in licensed care in terms of either deaths, injuries or complaints, we are unable to make a comparative analysis to licensed care. However, we can calculate that the overall mortality rate of children in Ontario over the period is 50 times greater than that of ICP care.", "“Thus, despite the six tragic deaths that have occurred in the last five years, ICP care provides a safer environment for our children than that experienced by other children in general. These facts and calculations do not make the six deaths that took place over the last five years any less tragic, yet the fact that only one of those deaths was classified as accidental and occurred with an ICP in compliance with the current regulations clearly indicates that the real issue is not the existing regulations but the lack of oversight that prevents providers from working outside the law. Although Minister Sandals promises this bill will provide the oversight necessary to ensure ICPs caring for more children than the law allows, the promise is an empty one. One cannot shut down what one cannot find.", "“As long as this government refuses to facilitate a registry or licensing system for individual daycare providers, there will never be effective oversight. Minister Sandals’s encouragement of ICPs joining licensed agencies to prevent this crisis is disobliging at best, as the fees charged by the agencies would result in ICPs absorbing an average loss of 20%.", "“To briefly recap, should Bill 10 pass with the proposal to amend the number and age ratios of children that ICPs can care for, we expect the following: approximately 140,000”—", "Interjection." ],

This legislation, if passed, also includes tougher penalties for alcohol-impaired driving, such as longer licence suspensions, immediate vehicle impoundments, requirements for ignition interlock, and escalating sanctions for drivers with a blood alcohol content in the warn range.", "Although recent statistics show that Ontario’s fatality rate of licensed drivers is the lowest ever recorded, on average a person is killed on our roads every 18 hours. That is one more important reason that we’re going to target those drivers who still aren’t getting the message and continue to use their cellphones while behind the wheel. We’re proposing fine range increases, from $60 to $500 up to $300 to $1,000 and, going forward, we plan to introduce three demerit points upon conviction and add distracted driving prohibitions to the graduated licensing system.", "This government took action on distracted driving in 2009 by banning the use of handheld devices, and we’re going to continue to take action today and in the future. The evidence speaks for itself. A driver who uses a cellphone is four times more likely to be involved in a crash. Make no mistake: Safe driving requires undivided attention.", "Public education will be a large part of our work going forward. We will continue to work with our valuable road safety partners to make sure that distracted drivers get the message: Keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road.", "The legislation also looks at what we can do to improve pedestrian safety. Although the good news is that the number of pedestrians killed has declined significantly over the last 25 years, pedestrians still represent about one in five of all motor-vehicle-related fatalities in Ontario; 46% of those fatalities occurred at intersections.", "In response to the coroner’s office recommendations and municipal requests, this legislation, if passed, would require drivers to yield the whole roadway to pedestrians at school crossings and pedestrian crossovers. It would also support the use of new pedestrian crossing devices.", "We know that there are other choices people need to make in order to get around, and healthy choices such as cycling, walking and active transportation are all part and parcel of a range of solutions that will help address congestion and improve our air quality. If passed, this legislation would build on #CycleON, Ontario’s 20-year strategy to become the safest, most cycling-friendly jurisdiction in North America. It would increase fines and demerit points for motorists dooring cyclists, and where practical it would require motorists to keep a distance of at least one metre between their vehicles and cyclists when passing. It would also support cycling on paved shoulders of unrestricted provincial highways and in contraflow bicycle lanes in urban centres to give cyclists more choices with respect to how and where to travel.", "In addition, if passed, this legislation would update our mandatory medical reporting program. Future regulations could allow us to accept recommendations from a broader range of health care practitioners, a measure which responds to requests from the medical community about our mandatory medical reporting program.", "This legislation would also respond to municipal requests for assistance with respect to collecting unpaid Provincial Offences Act fines. We would put yet another tool in place to help fine collection and help keep our municipal roads safe.", "These changes and numerous others we’re proposing recognize that everyone, from the most vulnerable to the most seasoned, needs to feel safe and protected on our roads and highways. On that note, I’d like to recognize that this week is also School Bus Safety Week here in Ontario. We join the Ontario School Bus Association in reminding everyone to be alert, slow down and obey the rules of the road around school buses and in school crossing zones.", "It’s also national teen safe driving week. Led by Parachute Canada, one of our dedicated road safety partners, teen safe driving week is a good time to talk to teenagers and young adults about distracted driving, impaired driving and why making safe driving choices can literally make or break their future.", "Unsafe drivers and vehicles have no place on Ontario’s roads. The people of our province deserve no less. We are a North American leader in road safety, and we are committed to keeping it that way. I urge all members on all sides of this House to support this legislation." ],

Our ministry’s priority is educating consumers so that they can make smart decisions and ensure that they are able to protect themselves against scams, fraud and predatory practices.", "The Consumer Protection Act is our ministry’s hallmark piece of legislation. It governs consumer transactions and protects Ontarians in their day-to-day lives. The Consumer Protection Act allows Ontarians the certainty of clearer contracts, various protection tools, and offers remedies for a consumer if a business makes a false, misleading or inappropriate transaction.", "In 2013, our Consumer Protection Branch continued to take steps to ensure that consumers are protected across the province, arranging for nearly $500,000 in refunds and cancelled contracts and to help reclaim over a million dollars in fines and legal settlements for Ontarians.", "Another important initiative I’m sure you are all aware of, and our government is pleased with, is our progress on the Wireless Services Agreement Act. This has been a huge step forward for consumers in this province. I was proud to first introduce this bill in 2010, and today wireless providers are required to draft contracts which clearly lay out the services and fees for consumers who, in turn, now have a better understanding of their rights when renewing their existing contracts, or cancelling them.", "Our Stronger Protection for Ontario Consumers Act, 2013, is another piece of legislation that our government is pleased to proceed with. The bill targets three very important areas of consumer protection. First, it helps to curb aggressive door-to-door sales tactics, especially for the sale of water heaters. It protects vulnerable, indebted consumers against the misleading and abusive practices of some companies offering debt settlement services. Thirdly, it strengthens the integrity of real estate bidding practices and allows consumers more power to negotiate flexible, lower-cost arrangements when using a real estate professional.", "We’re pleased with the progress our government has made since 2003; however, we certainly recognize that more needs to be done. When I was appointed Minister of Government and Consumer Services, I was excited about the opportunities to serve in this role, and as minister I will continue our government’s work to provide even greater protection for the people of Ontario. My ministry’s mandate letter lays out the framework for these priorities. The priorities are the next logical steps to our already strong record, picking up where my predecessors left off.", "We’re committed to two key overarching priorities over the next four years: First, strengthening consumer services and, second, building a dynamic business climate. At the forefront of this is the need for expanding the protection for condominium buyers and owners through modernizing the Condominium Act.", "We recognize how important these updates are, and how diverse the needs of condominium owners and buyers are. We need to continue to strengthen consumer marketplace fairness and transparency regulations, specifically in the areas of home renovations, moving companies, and home inspector qualifications, as well as examining the issue of online consumer protection so we can move in that direction as well.", "We’ll be exploring opportunities to strengthen consumer protection measures by working together across ministries to ensure that all Ontarians are protected, especially those who are most vulnerable. As set out in our platform, we are excited to begin working on the consumer bill of rights. We’ll be undertaking consultations around the creation of this.", "And finally, we’re continuing to build up our strong brand of identity for Consumer Protection Ontario to ensure Ontarians know where they can go for trusted information and advice on important consumer issues.", "Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues here in the House today for listening as I update Ontarians on consumer protection measures. I’m proud of our government’s record and I’m excited to move forward on these priorities. Thank you." ],

We all know that many of these injuries and deaths can be prevented, and we recognize the work of groups like Parachute Canada to raise awareness of the problems and seek shared solutions.", "I do want to be clear, Speaker, that given the impacts of distracted and impaired driving, it is essential that we take significant steps toward better education and tougher penalties to ensure drivers are focusing on the road. We all know, and many have first-hand experience in the past, of course, with the number of distractions faced by the modern driver. We all know the impacts distracted driving can cause. That’s why it’s the government’s responsibility and our responsibility as legislators to ensure our laws reflect the startling realities we see on our roads.", "I support many of the principles that are at the heart of this act.

The statistics speak for themselves. I look forward to debating how we can make those rules stricter.", "When we talk about drugged driving, like drinking and driving, it’s unthinkable. We need to hammer home the idea that drugged driving is just as bad and unacceptable in Ontario.", "Cycling: I come from a community where active transportation is a big topic, so any way we can make cycling safer beyond what might be proposed, I think, is something that would be worthy of debate.", "I look forward to putting in place stricter regulations in terms of cycling safety and pedestrian safety likewise.

Unfortunately, we haven’t had that meeting yet. I wish we could have had that done before today, because we have some really important things I would like to express to the minister.", "However, like many, I’ve seen the commercials and ads that the government has run informing consumers of their rights. We’ve heard concerns regarding collection agencies, water heater rentals and home renovations, to name just a few. While I’m happy to hear the government say it will take additional steps to protect consumers, I am concerned that the minister’s update did not address much of the feedback I have been hearing, certainly in my riding. This is a government that has been in power for 11 years, and in that time, it has often been focused more on harassing businesses than on protecting consumers.", "Too often I get the comment from businesses in my riding, “I wish the government would get out of my way,” because of over-regulation. For instance, today’s announcement does nothing to help businesses affected by TSSA red tape. The Downie Street Bake House located in Stratford in my riding of Perth–Wellington is one example. They invested good money in high-quality used ovens, but then the TSSA came along. They made a host of unreasonable demands to get the ovens certified for use. My constituents had no choice but to go $20,000 more in debt to buy new lower-grade ovens.", "Since I have been the critic, I’ve also received numerous emails regarding the Tarion Warranty Corp. and the issues consumers have had with warranties on their new homes. It is my hope that the minister will take further action to address those having difficulties with the TSSA, Tarion and many other government agencies." ],

It’s been brewing for a number of years. There are so many constituents not just in my riding, but across the entire province continually talking about the fact that no matter what they try to do, no matter how many efforts they take, they simply cannot get the coverage they’re entitled to.", "They’ve tried to reach out to the ministry. They’ve tried to reach out to the government. There’s only one option when it comes to a new home in Ontario, and it’s Tarion. The government has essentially created a one-warranty system—a monopoly on the system. The government has a responsibility to ensure that this one warranty provider is providing a good service. The government has a responsibility to ensure that the one mandated warranty system actually serves the interests of the people of Ontario, not the builders and not the developers.", "This is a serious concern. Constituents have come to me with complaints regarding shoddy workmanship in a brand new home that took numerous efforts to rectify, and still, nothing was done. When they went to Tarion, Tarion tried everything possible to deny the claim. It seems that Tarion is more in the business of denying warranty claims than in actually addressing warranty concerns.", "One of the other areas that has been raised by a number of my constituents—and I hope the government will take action on this. While the consumer bill of rights is a great idea, one of the proposals that the NDP has pushed forward a number of times is a consumer rights ombudsman: a direct, independent body that consumers can go to to address concerns around consumer rights whenever there are violations of those rights. I encourage the government to consider our proposal of having an ombudsman for consumer rights." ],

  "text" : [ "Thanks, Speaker, very much. I’m glad to stand up and speak to Bill 15, Fighting Fraud and Reducing Automobile Insurance Rates Act, 2014. It’s not the first time in this House that I’ve had to get up and speak regarding automobile insurance, and I’m pretty sure it won’t be the last time as we go forward. Before I start, though, I’d like to go over an overview of the history of auto insurance in the province of Ontario, just to refresh the memories of those who are listening with regard to how we got to where we are today.", "In 1914, auto insurance was added to the Insurance Act, but at that time it was not compulsory.", "In 1932, minimum third party liability limits were introduced. Anyone who bought insurance had to buy minimum coverage to protect them if they got sued. This was actually the first version of compulsory coverage.", "We go up to 1972, and all policies are to have no-fault benefits for loss of income, medical and rehabilitation expenses not covered by OHIP. This was the first case of no-fault insurance.", "In 1980, auto insurance becomes compulsory for all vehicle owners in Ontario; now, in a sense, it has become a tax to the people of Ontario because they are now forced to purchase auto insurance.", "In 1985, a crisis of auto insurance availability and affordability occurs due to rising bodily injury claims.", "In 1988, Bill 2 came around to create the Automobile Insurance Board, with a mandate to conduct hearings on auto rates.", "In 1990, Bill 68, brought up by the Liberal government, enriches the no-fault benefits.", "In 1991, the NDP abandoned plans to make auto insurance public, realizing that it’s not justifiable in this province.", "In 1994, Bill 164 was introduced, which includes additional no-fault benefits, making the product richer and richer.", "In 1996, the PC government introduced legislation to try to simplify the product, making the system less costly.", "In 2003, this Liberal government introduced a freeze of rates because big industry losses were about to cause big increases in our premiums. It was the first time that this Liberal government decided to meddle in private industry.", "In 2004, a white paper was released, saying that people with employment insurance should be able to opt out of some mandatory coverage, and therefore they’re not covered twice. Unfortunately, this went nowhere, and it’s due to the inaction of this government.", "Could you imagine, Speaker, that if your own work insurance covered you for certain coverage for when you got injured in an automobile accident, you would no longer have to pay that premium on your auto insurance bill, and how much money could be saved throughout this province for people who have two types of insurance? I think maybe the government should dust off that white paper and revisit it again as we’re moving forward with reforming the auto insurance product throughout the province.", "In 2010, this government introduced major reforms that reduced coverage and resulted in high levels of mediation and arbitration as a result of people not satisfied with getting the services they need after an automobile accident. The end result of all these years of changes to the automobile product is a costly, complex system that has bureaucracy on top of bureaucracy on top of bureaucracy, and regulation upon regulation upon regulation, which brought us up to last year, when the government brought forward Bill 171 just before the election. They tried to fast-track it through the Legislature in order to have something that they could hold up to the people of this province in the upcoming election.", "Here we are today with Bill 15, which has now been reintroduced. The government has brought that forward in order to deal with their promise of a 15% cut in insurance rates throughout the province. This promise they made, of a 15% decrease, allowed them to stay in power one extra year because it bought the support of the NDP to prop up this government for an extra year of Liberal governance.", "We’ve said a long time, in our rebuttal of that 15% cut promise, that a unilateral cut to insurance rates without cost savings in the industry would lead to unintended and negative consequences. We’ve seen this evidence on a few fronts. The availability of insurance has decreased in this province. State Farm sold its entire property and casualty business in Canada. They cited the Ontario auto insurance market as a key reason for this. This is a bad trend, as New Jersey promised to cut rates by 15% in 1998. Numerous companies left the market at that time, making auto insurance very difficult to obtain. While rates did come down by 15% over two years, the lack of availability led to a 27% spike in premiums in 2000.", "Further, we’re starting to hear from various constituency offices that people with a few blemishes on their record are being dropped by their insurance carriers. Insurers cannot drop a client during their policy, but they can refuse to renew a policy. I’ve had a few constituents in my office who have noted that since this government has mandated the 15% cut, their house insurance policies seem to have been creeping up. It’s something that we warned against when the government came forward with this 15% cut; however, they wanted to stay in power an extra year and went forth with that promise.", "Any move that required all companies to cut rates I think would be a dangerous move. I’m quoting Philip Howell right now. Phil Howell is the CEO of FSCO, the Financial Services Commission of Ontario. They are the regulators of the product throughout the province, under the direction of the Ministry of Finance. In the Standing Committee on General Government on April 15, 2013, Phil Howell stepped forward to make this comment, and I quote Phil: “So any move that required all companies to cut rates I think would be very dangerous right now. As well as that, I think you would find situations where people would just have less access to insurance and perhaps be forced into the Facility Association, paying much higher rates than they currently are.” That was Phil Howell.", "For those that are listening at home, and here, who don’t know what the Facility Association is, the Facility Association is basically where you go when no one in this province will insure you. You’ll note that when there are problems in the availability of insurance product, the usage of the Facility Association grows and grows. The problem with the Facility Association having to insure people is the fact that this product—auto insurance—is not going to be fully accessible to people throughout the province.", "The second item that I’m seeing evidence of is that bad drivers are getting bigger discounts. We mentioned that also to this government when they decided to enforce a 15% reduction in auto insurance rates; that, in fact, in order to get that average drop of 15%, those paying higher premiums might see a higher decrease in their premiums in order to balance out those that are paying the lower premiums to start with. So what you’re seeing here—from filings in January 2014, the biggest winners were those insured by non-standard insurers. Non-standard insurers are those that will insure the worst drivers on the road—those with multiple accidents or those with drinking and driving convictions; basically, the people who are one step away from having to go to the Facility Association.", "Just to review what they gave out, the non-standard companies and their respective rate reductions were as follows: Perth Insurance Co. gave a 15% reduction, Pafco Insurance Co. gave a 14.5% reduction and Echelon General Insurance Co. gave an 8.7% reduction. Those at home might say that’s great, but remember, these are the insurance decreases for those who are drunk drivers in our province, those who can cause multiple accidents. So in essence, this 15% rate reduction brought forward by the government, supported by the NDP, has in fact been giving better discounts to the poor drivers of this province, where those who follow the rules and pay their premiums every year are not achieving the same rate discounts throughout this province.", "I’d also like to make note of a comparison of Bill 171 to Bill 15, and the fact that this government has gone from one end of the spectrum to the other end of the spectrum. In order to fight fraud from the fraud task force report, which was delivered over two years ago with over 38 recommendations, of which this government has implemented maybe four or five, they’re now coming out with Bill 171: “We’re going to regulate health care clinics throughout this province.” We agreed with regulating health care clinics, but we did not agree on how to regulate the health care clinics. They wanted to create this whole new bureaucracy at FSCO, where FSCO would have to double their bureaucracy in order to regulate these health care clinics throughout the province.", "Our way was a much simpler method: using the health colleges throughout the province that are here to regulate the health care clinics, much like pharmacy is regulated throughout the province. The Ontario College of Pharmacists has a contact at the pharmacy, which is a designated manager, and they assume all responsibilities, legal and otherwise, to ensure that the pharmacy is following the rules. If there is a problem and they are not following the rules, and that designated manager is aware of that, they will lose their health care licence—the pharmacist loses their licence.", "We could do the same thing with health care clinics throughout this province. They would have to have a designated health care professional running the clinic and taking care of the legal aspects of the business. If the clinic wants to be fraudulent in any sort of way, that designated manager would lose their licence if they were in on the act. This, I believe, would really take up the fraud part of health care clinics, end that practice, and at the same time be a minimal cost to the businesses and the health care and insurance industries throughout the province.", "However, I was really shocked when I picked up Bill 15 thinking that maybe this government, last year in committee, listened to my idea about having designated managers run the health care clinics in order to reduce fraud. I was kind of hoping they’d listen to it, but they’ve gone to the other end of the spectrum. It’s not even in Bill 15. For some reason, one of the fraud report’s recommendations disappeared. I guess it’s not that important anymore for this government to really look at fraud. I think they’re putting some window dressing on it, but for some reason, they don’t care about going after this aspect of fraud, which is pretty rampant in the GTA and Toronto area with these health care clinics. I don’t know what went wrong with their abilities to want to really fight fraud, to really deal with the issue of auto insurance, to really look at lowering costs in the system in order to reduce the rates, but apparently, I guess they feel that they don’t really have to go down that road in order to achieve the results.", "Further to that, the government has introduced other aspects into Bill 15 which are part of the fraud task force report. We’d like to look at that in committee as this bill gets going farther down the road to ensure that this government, with a history of building bureaucracy and cost to systems, doesn’t necessarily do that going forward with the auto insurance product. I think the bureaucracy and costs, not only in the insurance industry but—all that cost gets trickled down to us policyholders, those who are paying the bills, to ensure that we can have the safety of being supported in case of an automobile accident. We want to make sure, through Bill 15, that they don’t take the opportunity to create new fiefdoms and new czars of auto insurance in order to mandate a 15% cut which, two or three years down the road, when prices spike because they had done nothing, really, for the cost in the auto insurance product and people aren’t able to get access to the product—that we aren’t going to be back here debating it again.", "When we discuss this in committee, we’re going to be making sure that each and every part of this bill lays out the least bureaucratic, least costly way to reduce the cost of the auto insurance product.", "Our party put forth some recommendations early last year to ensure that we could actually deal with auto insurance rates throughout this province, to ensure that there’s competition back in the market. Some people say, “What do you mean, there’s no competition? It’s an open market.” Unfortunately, there is so much regulation, which I mentioned earlier, that the actual chances of two companies competing against one another in order to lower their rates, much like any businesses across the province will compete in order to attract business—they’re pretty much deterred from doing so.", "We can just basically look at how to get your rate changed in this province. Right now, the auto insurance companies have to fill out a report, hire their mathematicians and justify any rate increase or decrease, which is thousands of pages long. It takes months to compile this request to lower or raise your rates. They submit it to FSCO, and FSCO does their own calculations, gets their own mathematicians, and if there are any missing notes in this 1,000-page document, if there’s anything out of the ordinary, it gets shipped back to the insurance company to fix up, which might add another month or two. Then you have it come back to FSCO, and after a couple of months of their having this document, they can say, “You can lower or raise your rates the next time the person files for return,” which usually happens on a monthly basis, depending on when your year is up.", "In a marketplace, in general terms—I’ll use Walmart again—if Walmart has all of a sudden got a shipment in, a product of widgets, that in fact lowered their cost, which would allow them to cut their sale price down in order to outcompete The Bay, for instance, they would do that within the day. I’m sure they have the computer system set up so that automatically, when head office gets that money, it filters through and the price comes down. You see it in their commercials, the happy face and the prices coming down.", "The insurance industry would like to do the same, because they would garner more people to buy their product if they were able to compete on price. No matter who, whether it be Aviva or what have you, the fact of the matter is that they can’t do it. In essence, they could offer a lower price to a consumer. However, for them to initiate that price change to go down, you’re looking at over a year before they can actually implement that change, and then you’d have to wait for that person to renew their policy.", "The same instance that’s a problem with that is, if something happens in the industry—say, accident increases go through the roof and now the insurance industry is looking at a loss and they’d like to raise their prices after giving the discount—again, that would take over a year, and most businesses would be hard-pressed to survive the fact that they can’t raise their rates in the short term in order to stay in business or come out even. Otherwise, you can just imagine everyone’s rates skyrocketing with the fact that they would have to wait over a year to do so.", "To make this story short, Mr. Speaker, we had proposed a file-and-use system which, provided that the insurance company is lowering or raising their rates between a set percentage—and this is ideal for FSCO the regulator to do. FSCO can decide what is an acceptable percentage to raise or lower your rates. If the insurance companies in fact are allowed to do so, then why not, like other jurisdictions around this world, allow them to lower their rates, file them: “We are lowering our rates to this amount,” or, “We’re raising our rates this amount. We’re in that parameter”? FSCO goes, “Okay, it’s done.” They can now offer incentives for people who drive better. They can bring in the technology which is slowly coming into the marketplace, those little devices that will track how you drive your car. The best way to use one of those devices is to have the file-and-use system where you can change the rates monthly or biweekly, on how well they’re driving. It will improve driving.", "A file-and-use system will allow them to compete with each other. If Walmart wants to get into insurance, if they want to sell insurance, they could be the low-cost provider and lower their rates whenever they feel like it in order to compete against the other insurance companies. I can tell you that competition in the marketplace will definitely increase the product availability for people and ensure that people have the coverage they need.", "The auto insurance product is broken. They’re trying to deal with it also through mediation-arbitration. The Auditor General noted a few years ago that the backlog was months upon months upon months, compared to the 60 days in which it had to be dealt with. You look at the changes they made in 2010, which probably caused the increase in arbitration-mediation. We would like to see private mediators brought in to help deal with mediation so that it would be fast-tracked through. They’re obviously not coming forward with that.", "We’d also like to see changes in the product where you would have peer-to-peer review. So you hurt your back in a car accident, you go to a chiropractor, and the chiropractor says, “You need this and this treatment”; it goes to the insurance adjustor and they look at it and go, “Well, I’ll let this neurosurgeon take a look at it,” and of course most likely he’d deny it or find some other reason, so there’s a fight starting there. We’d like to see, if you use a chiropractor to get service, that you go to your insurance adjuster and actually they will use a chiropractor so you have peer-to-peer review. We think that would actually lower the amount of objections to people, and fighting, going to mediation and arbitration.", "My time is almost up. I appreciate the House allowing us to defer our lead. I am happy to open up the discussion for this party. I look forward, in committee, to having further discussions. These are just a few points off the top of my head that I thought I’d bring out, and hopefully we can expand upon them. Thank you." ],

  "text" : [ "I support any attempt to fight fraud and lower auto insurance, but Bill 15 has some major errors.", "First, it separates the process by which victims can seek redress. Bill 15 takes away the victim’s right to turn to the courts against insurance companies who refuse to pay. Without Bill 15, a victim has the right to either go to court or an arbitration tribunal. Now they’ll be forced to use the tribunal. This means that if they prove the insurance company owes them money, it will be harder to get their legal fees covered. It also means that if it’s proven that someone else is at fault for the accident, the victim will have to go to court against whoever injured them and then go to a tribunal to get the money from the insurance company. Instead of doing this at the same time, it will require two different procedures—very costly.", "Oftentimes these victims are seriously injured. This system would mean more lawyers, more court fees and less accessibility to justice for the victims of accidents here in Ontario.", "The other major problem is the interest issue. As it stands now, if a victim is owed pain and suffering and an insurance company refuses to pay, the company is charged 5%. The bill would lower that rate to 1.3%. That means less money for the victim of the accident and it means insurance companies are less pressured, which is important, to pay what they owe.", "Fighting fraud and high insurance rates is a good thing, but this bill stands to give big companies a break and further hurt victims of car accidents." ],

I mean, driving records, where we drive, how we drive and what type of vehicle we drive all play a big role.", "I will admit that some few years back, not too long ago, I can say I was one of those unfortunate folks that seemed to encounter the law maybe more than once or twice. My insurance premium did go up substantially. And you know what? I wasn’t there to complain, because I created that scenario where, frankly, the insurance company didn’t appreciate my driving record.", "So I’ve made a concerted effort since then. We drive—at least I do, as an MPP—some 3,000 to 5,000 kilometres a month, so it’s not hard sometimes to have a bit of a heavy foot. But let me say this: I more religiously use speed control. I set a speed and I try to stick to that speed. My insurance has gone down. It’s gone down dramatically in the last two or three years because, obviously, my record could match it.", "Bill 15 is a good bill to initiate some of those things, but I think, at the end of the day, we really have a huge part in what our insurance premiums will be like." ],

Fraud is highlighted as the biggest issue, especially around the GTA, where insurance rates are the highest, and we lack the ability to really get at that. Studies have shown that, and yet it’s just something that—really, all directions were pointing towards taking action finally, and we haven’t seen that. We look at the health clinics, different avenues that have been used to really jack up the cost—not attacked in this bill. That’s unfortunate, because I think there was a chance to do something.", "Also, we talked about the regulation around raising or dropping the insurance rates and the time frame involved. I know that, last year, my rates went up significantly in November. Instead of being a year’s rate, they went to a semi-annual, so it was renewed again in July. So it’s frustrating when we see the high rates that we’re paying compared to our neighbours in other provinces, but we also have to look at what the issues are.", "We have to also give a reasonable tool for insurance companies. Now we’re forcing them to estimate, almost a year ahead of time, what the rates will be and what the returns will be when they’re setting them. It’s easy just to ignore the fact that they maybe have an opportunity to drop the rates but it’s so cumbersome that they don’t bother. It’s the same, of course, if you’re anticipating the rates going up; you have to start today to get those higher rates. It’s just a system that’s not working. So we’ll look forward to further debate on this." ],

These changes will contribute little, if anything, to reducing auto insurance rates. What they will do is penalize accident victims. They will punish the people who have been harmed in auto accidents and create barriers in terms of their access to justice.", "We have some very, very significant problems with this legislation around the changes to the dispute resolution system.

I’m going to talk about some of the history of what has gone on in auto insurance. I’ll take a little different direction than what was taken by my colleague from the Conservative Party. We’ll talk about where we’re at now, what’s going on with the cuts which we fought so hard to see. We’ll talk about what the priorities of the Liberal government really are. I want to review some of the steps that have been taken by the NDP and the steps that I’ve worked really hard on with respect to this file. I want you to start thinking about auto insurance, how it has impacted people, and some of the policies that have been implemented so far and how unfair they are. I want to uncover some of that. So let’s go down the rabbit hole together, shall we?", "First off, what’s the history of the situation? I don’t want to go too far back; I want to take you to 2010. The year 2010 marks a significant change in the auto insurance industry. It’s very important to look at 2010. There was a completely different climate in auto insurance pre-2010. It changed drastically after 2010. Up until 2010, the insurance companies were experiencing a net loss, what they call a loss ratio, which resulted in—if they added up the amount of premiums they were receiving and what they were paying out, they were in a loss. So they were paying out more money than they were taking in, strictly on the premium side. That changed dramatically post-2010.", "One other point to keep in mind: When the insurance companies talk about their profits or their losses, they make some of their profit on the premiums, but they make far more on their investment income. They actually double whatever they’re making on premiums. In some cases, it’s about that same amount, so you have to times it by two to actually get a true picture of what their profits are. So they have premiums, and they have investment income.", "After 2010, this government recognized that the rates were too high. This is not a surprise; the rates were extremely high and people were struggling. We also have to recognize in this province—outside of some of the core areas in Toronto where we have an existing transit system—which needs improvement—made up of subways and streetcars, some LRTs as well as buses, there isn’t really a sustainable transit system. If you’re talking to my colleagues from Windsor, if you’re talking to people from London, to folks in the surrounding suburbs in Brampton and Scarborough and North York—there isn’t really a robust transit system. People actually would love to be able to take transit, but they can’t. To get to work, to get to their loved ones, to take them to school, to go to the hospital, they simply need to drive. It’s not a luxury. It’s not because they just enjoy it; they have to.", "Now, if we know that it’s a necessity in certain areas, and we’ve made it so that auto insurance is mandatory—the government has made it mandatory that you must have insurance in this province. It’s a product that everyone has to have. That’s a great market. If I’m in the business of insurance and I know that every single person who drives on the roads in Ontario has to purchase auto insurance, I know that’s a sure-selling product. That’s a great product for me. So what have we built into the system? Recognizing that this is mandatory, that you have to purchase auto insurance, we’ve built into the system a requirement that the government has an obligation to regulate this industry. If you regulate that you have to purchase it, then it makes sense that you have to regulate whether it’s affordable or not, whether it’s delivered in a fair manner or not. With that in mind, the government has a power, has the ability to regulate this industry. And rightly so, because it’s essentially a product that you have to purchase by law.", "In 2010, the government recognized the rates were too high. The then Minister of Finance got up and said—I’m essentially paraphrasing—that recognizing that rates are too high, we will bring in some major reforms, huge. In fact, they were the most historically significant changes to auto insurance in pretty much the history of Ontario. The Finance Minister got up and said, “I’m going to be bringing in these changes. These changes are going to reduce the cost to the insurance companies.” Well, guess what? They reduced the cost in one year. When bringing in the changes in 2010, they reduced the cost to insurance companies by 50% across the province of Ontario. The statutory accident benefits—the payouts I talked about before—were slashed in half. That’s pretty dramatic. On top of that, if you just localized it to the GTA, the greater Toronto area, those reductions were more like 70%.", "Just wrap your head around this. Imagine you’re running any business, you’re running a restaurant, and overnight, in one year, your major cost—in the case of insurance companies, their major cost is their accident benefits, what they pay out—the major cost to your business is slashed in half in one year. Imagine the position that puts you in. You’re going to be in a much better position than you were before, naturally: Your costs have gone down by 50%. Imagine what that means for one particular area. Imagine running a business and in one area—a pretty vast area—your costs went down by 70%.", "So naturally, the savings are there; the insurance companies don’t deny it. They accept and, in committee hearings, time and time again—in fact, you could Google it and they’ll tell you online that, yes, we did in fact see $2 billion in savings. The insurance companies have seen this, each year, from 2011 onwards, approximately. So 2011, they got the $2 billion in savings, and 2012, 2013, 2014—we’re in that year right now. This hasn’t changed.", "What happened in 2010 is, the government slashed our benefits. They slashed our coverage. By slashing our coverage, they allowed the insurance companies to save colossal sums of money. What they did, just to put it into specific terms—before, when you were injured, you could claim up to $100,000 in benefits. They took that $100,000 in benefits and cut it by half, to $50,000. So that was a cut of 50% there, in terms of your coverage. On top of that, this government created another category, where they put the cap at $3,500—$3,500. Just pause for a moment there. Before that, the very same person could have claimed up to $100,000; now, Mr. Speaker, that person can only claim $3,500. Imagine the impact that has on the industry.", "You’re probably wondering how many people actually are put into that $3,500 category. How many people is that? Maybe it’s not that many people; maybe it’s not that significant. Wrong: 80% of people injured in Ontario—80%—are actually put into the minor injury guideline, the $3,500 cap—80% of people who are injured.", "Keep in mind that in Ontario, 80% of people never make a claim in their life. They never make an auto insurance claim in their life. I’m sure you know a lot of people who—I’ve never made a claim in my life. They’re not uncommon. That’s 80% of people never make a claim in their life. The 20% that do make a claim—that small 20% that make a claim—of them, the vast majority only get $3,500. That’s the cap that they get. This is the picture of what’s going on here in Ontario.", "Now you see this historically amazing savings that the insurance companies are enjoying that’s happened overnight, from 2010 to 2011—what do you think happened with the insurance rates? Where do you think they went? You would assume, if the costs went down by so much, naturally the insurance rates should have gone down, right? You would expect that, naturally, premiums would have gone down. Guess what? They didn’t go down. They went up by 5%. Go figure.", "The insurance companies make a 50% savings—huge—on their costs, their payouts. Instead of premiums going down—they should have gone down by a lot, you would have thought—they go up by 5%." ],

You’re buying a ticket for a movie. The movie ticket used to cost $15. They cut the costs of the movie. They say, “All right, the movie is not going to cost as much to play.” You go to the movie theatre, thinking, “Okay, it’s not going to cost them as much to play this movie. Maybe the ticket price is going to go down.” You go and you find out the ticket price has actually gone up and you only get to watch half the movie. How does that make any sense? I don’t understand this.", "That’s where we’re at with auto insurance. That’s the history.", "The NDP comes forward—and I realize this was a major issue. Auto insurance was a top issue in all of Brampton, particularly in Bramalea–Gore–Malton. What did we do? First off, we went to the streets and talked to the community. They said, “Listen, this is a major issue. This is an issue that’s crushing us. We’re paying such amazingly, outrageously high rates. What can you do about it?” And I said, “Listen, I promise we’ll get up and we’ll fight on this issue. This is an important issue. As the opposition, we’ll raise this issue. We’ll bring it up in Queen’s Park.”", "It’s on the government. It’s the government’s responsibility, this Liberal government’s responsibility, to address it. They’re in charge. They’re in the driver’s seat. The Ministry of Finance is directly in control of FSCO, and FSCO regulates the auto insurance industry—straightforward. The government controls and regulates the insurance industry. It’s on them.", "Our job, as opposition, is to raise the issue. We raised the issue. We said, “Listen, people in Brampton are struggling.” It turns out—guess what?—it’s not just in Brampton. It’s across the GTA.

There’s this unbelievable unfairness going on. We said, “What can you do about it?”", "In fact, it’s not just a Brampton, Scarborough and North York issue.

On top of that, there’s this colossal unfairness where certain regions, just by living there, are paying far more than other areas.", "I want to draw your attention to the way the auto insurance regime works right now. We’ve decided, as a society, that there are certain generally accepted principles or factors that are socially acceptable and actuarially sound. Basically, they make sense in society, and there is some evidence to support why you should charge someone higher or lower rates. There are four essential criteria. These are the four grounds that you should set your insurance rates by:", "(1) The factor that you use should have a clear, comprehensible connection with the risk being insured.", "(2) The factor should be objective, measurable and verifiable.", "(3) The factor should be, to a great extent, controlled by the insured.", "(4) The factor should be perceived as fair and socially acceptable.", "One of the members of the Liberal Party in the back talked about the fact that he starting controlling his driving. He had too many tickets that made him not as favourable as someone to be insured. So based on those criteria, he decided to control himself. He said, “Okay, I’m going to put my cruise control on. I’m not going to speed as much.” That absolutely fits within the factor that it’s something that, to a great extent, is controlled by the insured—a great example. If you’re speeding or driving poorly, you can control that; you can drive better.", "But what about where you live? Can you control where you live, and is it socially acceptable to make that a factor? If I choose to live in a certain community—I’m born in that community, all my roots are there, all my friends are there, all my family is there, my employment is there, all the things that I know are there, I’m comfortable there, all my services I access are there—I’m going to be charged twice as much as another community just because I live there. I’m a good driver, I drive safely, I pay my taxes, I do everything appropriately, but I happen to live in a certain community. Just because I live in that community, I’m going to pay twice as much as somewhere else.", "Let’s talk about the GTA. In the GTA, everyone knows this: You may live in Mississauga, but you work in Toronto; you live in Scarborough, but you work in Brampton; you live in Brampton, but you work downtown. Take me, for example. I am at Queen’s Park every day of the week—my car is here at Queen’s Park every day—but I’m being charged rates based on the Peel region. How much sense does that make? If I get in an accident, my accident is going to be in downtown Toronto, where my car spends most of the time while Parliament is in session, like all of us, but I’m going to be charged based on my premiums in Brampton, though most of my accidents will probably take place where I spend most of the time during the week, which is downtown Toronto.", "The logic is not there, my friends, it’s not a socially acceptable factor, and where is the comprehensible concern with the risk being connected to the driver when we move all around the GTA? It’s absolutely unacceptable—a travesty. This is something that shows how unfair the system is.", "So we have this problem; we have this major problem. We raise this issue. We see the rates are unfair, the rates are too high, certain areas are being discriminated against unfairly, and we bring forward this issue. We bring forward a petition; 10,000 people signed this petition. We put down 1,000 petitions every day for 10 days leading up to a demand for some change so that we can see the rates come down. We build this issue up and have mainstream media coverage. This one issue that started off in Bramalea–Gore–Malton spreads across the province. We have a province-wide concern and awareness that insurance rates are too high; we need to do something about it.", "The NDP brings forward an opposition day motion. This motion called for the government to reduce auto insurance by 15%. Given the amazing profits that the insurance industry is enjoying, given the sustained cut to their costs, which is not going to change—the caps that are now placed are not in jeopardy of being changed. They’ve been passed; the regulation has been set. Now the caps are $3,500 for a minor injury, $50,000 for more serious and then the catastrophic injury. They’ve saved so much money. We’re saying that at the minimum now, with the new climate going on, with the new circumstances, we need a 15% reduction in auto insurance for the drivers of Ontario. We put forward that motion. After all our hard work bringing forward petitions, bringing forward questions in the House, raising this issue time and time again, speaking about it in the media, we gained the momentum and we put this motion forward in this House.", "Surprisingly, the Liberal government finally saw the light of day and said, “Okay, we’ll support you.” They voted in favour of this motion, and that motion was passed—probably one of the few opposition day motions that asked the government to do something concrete, like reduce insurance rates by 15%, that actually passed. So we had a motion that was passed in the House, a pretty big victory in this battle to raise awareness around auto insurance. The people were happy that it looked like there was some movement being made.", "Then comes the budget. Looking at the fact that there’s an insurance industry that seems to be taking advantage of people based on where they live and taking advantage of people in the sense that their coverage has gone down but the premiums are still increasing, that these insurance companies are treating people unfairly, we say, “Listen, we need to see a reduction. If you actually care about the folks that are struggling, where it’s an affordability issue for them, we need to see a 15% reduction in auto insurance.” We put that forward as a demand. The government accepts that demand, accepts our request, and it forms a part of the budget.", "Now a year later, guess what happens? The government has said, “We are targeting an 8% reduction the first year and a 7% reduction in the second year.” So a year goes by after this budget is passed. One year goes by and we look at the insurance rates. I go to my community and ask folks in Brampton. We ask folks outside of Brampton, folks around the province. We ask folks in Scarborough and North York and in southwestern Ontario. We ask, “What has been going on with your rates?” Well, in the GTA, people did not see their rates go down. The vast majority of folks that I spoke to from Bramalea–Gore–Malton and folks from Brampton said that instead of going down, they saw their rates go up once again.", "So the government promises a reduction, and instead of seeing a reduction, people see their rates go up. How is that possible, if you have any sort of conviction and you believe in following through on your word, that people see their rates go up? Each time an insurance company increases its rates, it has to file for permission with FSCO. So the government has to approve of rates. How is this government approving rate increases when they’ve been given a mandate to reduce auto insurance rates? How does that make any sense?", "So I spoke to folks in our community. We said, “Listen, have the rates gone down?” They said, “No, our rates have not gone down.” We said, “If your rates have not gone down, then how can we possibly support this government?” They said, “Of course you can’t support the government. They broke their promise. They broke their promise to reduce auto insurance rates. They said they would reduce them at least by 8% in the first year, and we haven’t seen any of those reductions.”", "The government themselves claim that they didn’t hit the 8% at all; they hit something closer to 5%. So they themselves admit they didn’t make well on their promise. Their promise was to reduce by at least 8% in the first year. They did not do it. They broke their promise. We said, “Listen, you broke your promise, amongst many others. We can no longer support this government. We can’t trust this government to follow through. They broke their promise on reducing auto insurance.”", "We hoped that the folks of Ontario would have seen that this government breaks its promises time and time again and had big problems with their reliability and credibility when it came to the scandals that they were facing. Again, the folks of Ontario chose to support the Liberal government.", "We’re not going to give up our fight. We respect the decision of the Ontario people. But again, what message does it send if people are seeing you break your promises time and time again and we see voter turnout at an all-time low? It’s creating a cynical population. People just don’t believe in the government anymore. That’s why our turnouts are so low. They don’t see any hope.", "What we’re trying to do as the NDP is, we’re standing for our principles. We’re going to stand up for the folks in Ontario and let them know that there is another way. They can see a party and have a party that will follow through on their commitments, will make reasonable and realistic goals attainable and will stand up for principled positions towards a more progressive society.", "So that’s where we’ve come from. That’s where we fought and that’s where we got to.", "Now the Liberal government says, “Okay, we’re still”—even though very clearly we have reports where the finance minister has indicated that they agree that with less than a year to go, they’ve only seen a 6% decrease—they pledged an 8% target and they haven’t reached that—they insist that they’re going to meet this target. How are they going to meet this target? Well, they brought in this bill.", "Now, Bill 15, which was once Bill 171, is a bill that’s named very strategically.

We’ve seen that, time and time again, when it comes to corporate tax cuts as a tool to increase employment. It doesn’t work. You give a corporation a tax cut. They can take that money and reinvest it; they can take that money and sit on it; they can take that money and move it to another factory in another country. We’ve seen companies do that. We have a number of examples of that happening.", "Similarly, with the insurance companies, with the insurance industry, if you give them a blank cheque and you try to put more profits in their pockets, there’s no guarantee that that’s going to reduce premiums. We saw the biggest cost savings ever in 2010, which resulted in a $2-billion annual savings, actually increase premiums afterwards. There’s no guarantee unless you put some strings attached to it. This bill doesn’t have any metrics where, if we implement this insurance change or if we implement this tribunal change, that’s going to result in a 10% reduction, a 2% reduction or a 3% reduction. There’s absolutely no connection. There are no strings attached. There’s going to be another series of amendments that are going to benefit the insurance companies without any sort of connection to reducing premiums for drivers.", "Let’s go through the various elements of this bill. Using the explanatory note as an appendix, there is a component of this bill that deals with tow and storage services. There is a component that deals with repair and storage liens. There is a component that deals with the licensing of insurance agents. Let’s talk about those three right now. We’ll group those three together. These are presumably the only three that have anything to do with insurance fraud.", "We have tow trucks. Addressing tow trucks is an important issue. Sure, there are very valid concerns around the tow truck industry, and they need to be addressed. I know many tow truck drivers who would like to see their industry receive an increased level of respect, and part of that will come from having certain regulations that will ensure that there are good tow truck drivers who continue to do the good work they do, and the ones who aren’t doing such a good job are regulated or, in certain circumstances, not allowed to continue working if they’re going to breach a certain consumer bill of rights that’s proposed—a tow and storage consumer bill of rights.", "But how much is towing and storage going to impact the overall picture of auto insurance fraud in this province?

Show us what the savings are going to be and, on top of that, show us how those savings are actually going to reduce our premiums. That’s the most important thing. Where’s that calculation? I assure you that it’s not there.", "Licensing insurance agents and adjusters—are you suggesting that insurance agents and adjusters are a significant part of the fraud, that the insurance agents themselves are responsible for creating fraud? I would highly doubt that. The adjusters that work for the insurance companies, licensing them—these are the insurance companies themselves.", "There’s so much talk about fraud, but there’s so little talk about what the insurance companies themselves can do about addressing it. We absolutely agree that we need to address fraud in any system, whether it’s auto insurance, whether it’s in health care, whether it’s in any part of our system. We don’t accept it. We don’t believe that it’s an important thing. But if you talk about it so much—that fraud is a big problem—who is the primary mover in this industry? It’s the insurance industry. If you talk about fraud so much and there’s no discussion about what the insurance industry can do as the ones who write the cheque—at the end of the day, it’s the insurance company that writes the cheque—shouldn’t there be some onus placed on that industry itself to make sure that they’re not engaging in activities which are actually wasteful and they’re not supporting fraudulent activities? Shouldn’t they have an onus and a responsibility? These are multi-billion-dollar companies. Why isn’t the onus on them? We talk about fraud in the insurance industry. There has to be a discussion about what the insurance industry itself can do.", "Then we have the repair and storage liens, issues around repair and storage. Again, how much is this going to impact fraud—what are the dollars?—and how much of this is going to guarantee a reduction in premiums? Where’s the connection between the two?", "I can tell you that the two biggest components of this bill, which have absolutely nothing to do with fraud, are the changes to the tribunal and the changes to the interest rates. Let’s talk about those two changes.", "There’s a great article written by Mr. Shanoff, and he talks about this issue. He talks about what’s really going to happen when we actually implement this bill—if this bill is implemented, what would it actually do? We know for certain that this will benefit insurance companies. Mr. Shanoff wrote an article on March 15, 2014, entitled “Little Benefit for Victims.” This article talks about Bill 171 at the time, the Fighting Fraud and Reducing Automobile Insurance Rates Act, which is now Bill 15.", "Mr. Shanoff writes:", "“I can see where reduction of interest rates, removal of special awards and shunting cases away from experienced, independent arbitrators would benefit insurance companies.", "“But where is the benefit to drivers and accident victims?”", "That’s exactly what this bill is going to do. This bill is going to reduce the interest rates that insurance companies have to pay. It will remove the ability for special awards in cases where arbitrators find that the insurance companies are clearly in the wrong and need to make a payment immediately. There was a power that arbitrators had; that’s going to be removed.", "On top of that, this bill is going to remove the ability to challenge any sort of accident benefit claim in court. So you can’t go to the courts. If the insurance companies are not paying what you’re entitled to, and you know that it’s not going to be settled at arbitration and you need to go to court to challenge it, you can’t go to court at all.", "On top of that, it’s going to create a bigger problem, and my colleague touched on this. You can still bring a tort claim. You can still bring a claim that you’ve been injured in such a way that there’s a significant impact to your life. This is separate from the actual accident benefit. You may bring another claim. You can bring that to court. But often when you’re bringing that claim—you’re going to court because you have a tort claim; you have a legitimate claim that there was extreme negligence on the part of the other driver and you’re bringing a tort claim to court—normally what happens is there’s also a point where, if the insurance company has actually denied you some coverage that you’re entitled to, the lawyer can bring those both together and say, “Okay, we’re going to bring one application to court that includes both the accident benefits denial”—the fact that the insurance company said, “No, we’re not going to cover you,” in something that you think you should rightfully be entitled to coverage for—and on top of that, you can bring your regular claim for tort. You can bring them both together.", "Often, people who are in these circumstances are horribly injured. They’re very vulnerable. They’re in one of the worst positions of their lives, people who are down and out in a way I couldn’t even imagine. These folks, who are already down and out, have lawyers who are willing to fight the case for them, and they can bring it together in one application, one case, and take it to court. Now they can’t do that anymore. So now, you have one case you can bring to court, and the other case has to go through arbitration—and only arbitration. How unfair is that?", "That’s limiting access to the courts for these folks who are so vulnerable. These are people who are injured; these are people who are in difficult situations, often very disabled, physically disabled in a terrible way, and this is the type of legislation you’re bringing forward, where you’re going to limit their ability to go to court.", "I go back to Mr. Shanoff’s question: “Where is the benefit to drivers and accident victims?”", "When Mr. Shanoff talks about “shunting cases away from experienced, independent arbitrators,” what does he mean? Well, Justice Cunningham had a report. Justice Cunningham said there’s got to be some changes to the system; the way the system is currently set up, there need to be some changes. They enlisted the aid of this wonderful judge, who gave a report. He said there’s one problem in the overall way the system is set up: FSCO is the regulator.", "FSCO basically makes the decisions about what happens in the industry. They regulate it as the government regulator of auto insurance. FSCO is also where the arbitrators are housed. So you have the regulators and the decision-makers in the same building, in the same office, and there is a concern around that.", "Justice Cunningham’s concern was just that FSCO shouldn’t be doing both, that there’s an appearance here that if, on the one hand, you’re regulating, and on the other hand, making a decision, doesn’t add up and they should be held separately, which makes sense. But Justice Cunningham didn’t advise and didn’t say that you should get rid of the FSCO arbitrators. Why do I bring this issue up? What’s the point? What are the FSCO arbitrators about?", "The current arbitrators, the current decision-makers, let’s say, who deal with any dispute where the insurance company hasn’t paid you coverage that you think you’re entitled to, are people who are salaried. They have stable employment; they’re experienced; they have handled numerous cases; and they know the case law. That’s the current pool of folks who make the decisions. They’re transitioning from the FSCO arbitrators to the Licence Appeal Tribunal.", "Now, there’s nothing wrong with the Licence Appeal Tribunal. They’re folks who deal with highway traffic matters. They deal with matters related to tickets and things of that nature. They’re per diem, meaning that they come on a day-to-day basis—they’re not steadily employed as a salaried employee—and they are appointed at the pleasure of the ministry. They’re folks who don’t have the same stability, the same independence. They’re per diem; they work on a day-to-day basis. They can be appointed or not appointed by the ministry, or through ministry regulations. They don’t have any experience with this particular type of law. They don’t have experience with the exhaustive case law around what is appropriate coverage and what’s not, what is deemed suitable and what’s not deemed suitable.", "The current FSCO arbitrators have that wealth of knowledge. They’ve been doing this for years. They have the training. They have that independent position, they have that salaried position, that ensures they can remain independent.", "We all know that in law, but also in many things, to have a good decision-maker, you need someone who is independent, who is not swayed by the whims of political tides, who is not swayed by public pressure; someone who makes a decision based on principle and doesn’t make a decision because their appointment is at stake—they don’t know if they’ll be hired tomorrow or be brought back tomorrow.", "It’s clear that an independent decision-maker is always preferable to a non-independent decision-maker. The fact that this government is moving away from experienced, independent, knowledgeable arbitrators to folks who, through no fault of their own, don’t have the same level of experience, the same level of independence—again, as Mr. Shanoff says, I can see why this would benefit insurance companies. “But where is the benefit to drivers and accident victims?” I answered the question: There is none. There is no benefit to drivers and accident victims. This is another example of the priorities of this government.", "What are the priorities? Let’s look at all the examples we have before us. The priorities of this Liberal government are very clear. They want to continually put profits in the pockets of insurance companies and they don’t want to address the increasing concern around extremely high rates of auto insurance in this province. That’s their priority very clearly. Look at all the steps. You see a 50% reduction in costs in one year for auto insurance companies. You see two years to make a 15% reduction in premiums for drivers. That alone shows you the priority. You jump through hoops to get reductions for auto insurance companies; you drag your feet so slowly to bring any benefits to drivers. It shows your priorities very clearly. So that’s with respect to the changes in the licence tribunal.", "Now, there’s also a change in the interest rate. What’s that all about? The initial pre-judgment interest rates were set at 5%, and now the proposal is that they be reduced to 1.3%. What does that mean? Let’s break that down. If there’s a claim—I sue my insurance company and I am entitled to $100,000; I’m entitled to that $100,000 and that’s what I should be awarded at end of the day. Currently, the way the system works is, if the insurance company says, “No, I’m not paying the $100,000,” then there’s a 5% interest on that: 5% interest is charged and it accrues. So now, if I’m the insurance company, I look at this case and say, “Listen, chances are, we’re probably going to lose this case. If we don’t settle this case within a couple years, we’re paying 5% interest on top of that. It’s not a good look for us financially. We’re going to see a big loss, or we could make a lot more money if we just quickly paid this off and then reinvested our money and made a return on that money instead of holding it up, paying 5% interest on it and then we have to pay him anyways.” So what that does is, it encourages insurance companies, when there’s a real and legitimate case made against them, that they should probably settle, because it’s going to cost them more in the long run.", "What happens if the interest rates are dropped to 1.3%? Well, the insurance companies know that you can get a GIC at 2%. If I’m paying a 1.3% interest rate, there’s absolutely no benefit to me to settle. I can just take that $100,000 that I have to pay out to somebody and put that in some sort of safe vehicle that can actually give me a 2% rate of return, which is not too hard to get, or even more than that—you can probably find ways to get a higher return on equity. So they take that money, invest it somewhere, easily beat 5%, and say, “What’s the point of me settling? There’s absolutely no benefit to settling early. I’ll just drag this out as long as I need to.”", "On the other hand, you have a powerful insurance company, and you have a vulnerable, potentially disabled individual who doesn’t have any money and who says, “What do we do here? I need the money badly. I’m struggling.” The likelihood of them settling for something lower gets higher and higher. Again, how does this benefit drivers or accident benefits? It does not.", "Who does this benefit? The insurance industry. Where are the priorities of this government? It’s clear; you’re not making it hard for me to figure out your priorities. I just look at the legislation. I flip through it and I can see. The priorities are pretty clear: You want to ensure that the insurance industry gets whatever they want, anything they need when it comes to making more profits. That’s your priority. “What can we do to increase the profits of insurance companies?” Period. That’s your priority. Your priority is not to help out drivers. Your priority is not to help out accident victims. This law clearly does neither. It does not benefit drivers and it does not benefit accident victims.", "So we’ve gone on a journey here. We’ve talked about some of the history. We’ve talked about some of the current legislation and how it’s impacting drivers. Let’s look at a little bit more detail about what this bill actually does and how, again, this is going to assist drivers. We touched very briefly on the licensing of insurance agents and adjustors. Now, I want, folks, to take a closer look at this.", "The government, again, titled their bill very strategically: fighting fraud and reducing auto insurance. My colleague from London West said very well and very appropriately that the problem with this bill—there’s many problems, but one of the problems is the name of the bill. Because while the bill has all sorts of problems, and naturally we want to vote against something that has all these problems, you’re going to turn around and say, “Oh, you’re voting against fighting fraud. You’re voting against reducing auto insurance.” We’re not. We absolutely support reducing fraud. We absolutely support reducing auto insurance. But all of this has to be done with a principle in mind, with a goal in mind.", "Your goal we’re all clear on. Your goal is, “What can we do, by any means necessary, to increase the profits for insurance companies?” That’s not our goal. I’m sorry. It’s just not our goal. Our goal is, “What can we do, in a measured, reasonable way, to actually benefit drivers and accident victims?” That’s what we want to do. We’re not here to represent the interests of the insurance industry. We’re here to represent the interests of the drivers and their accident benefits when it comes to auto insurance. That’s who we’re here to benefit.", "This is something you can really see through. When you put in your bill the licensing of insurance agents and adjustors—I talked about this before. You’re going to put in legislation, and it proposes to look at various components around how you can limit and regulate folks who are either in the adjusting business or are insurance agents. It includes provisions that will speak about the licences, cases for when it should be issued, when it should be renewed, when it can be revoked—again, all these issues around insurance agents. I ask you—maybe in the question and comments someone can rise up and tell me this: How much fraud are insurance agents committing? Is that a significant cost? Do you have some evidence to suggest there is a pandemic of insurance agents who are defrauding the system? Where is the evidence to support this measure? There’s absolutely no problem with this measure; it’s fine. But how does this actually reduce auto insurance? How does this fight fraud? Where is the fraud-fighting measure in that?", "The same thing applies to adjusters. You talk about creating a system that would allow for the issuance, renewal, revocation, suspension and surrender of their licence—great. Why not? We should have qualified and responsible adjusters who work in our system. How does that reduce fraud? Where’s your evidence to suggest that adjusters are committing heinous acts of fraud? Where is the evidence to suggest they’re committing any fraud? Are you suggesting that the insurance agents and adjusters are the ones responsible for the current problem in our system?", "Again, I like to rely on evidence as opposed to just putting fluff in a bill. We sat with the chair of the anti-fraud task force, and I asked him, “Where is the fraud? What is the fraud all about?” He broke down the fraud into a couple of components. He said that there’s organized fraud, where there are criminal elements that have organized different strategic ways to defraud the system. That’s one. There was a system of not criminal, but quasi-criminal, where we had health service providers who were overbilling or charging in an inappropriate manner that in some cases probably rose to the level of criminal activity, but you had overcharging in those health professions. Then you had a case of individuals who, anecdotally, would boost up their claims. If they had a car and it was stolen, they said, “Oh, there was a laptop in the car as well,” or “There was a diamond ring in the car as well.” I said, “Okay, break down those three areas of fraud and which is the most significant?” He said that by far, it’s the organized fraud because recent changes have really reduced the issue around the health service providers.", "My colleague from the Conservative Party talked about, why is that component missing from here? Why is the health regulation component missing from here? Largely because the circumstances that existed, where there were significant costs associated with health service providers—that was all eradicated post-2010. The evidence has shown that if you can only claim $3,500 max for 80% of people, there’s really not much fraud left there to go after. That fraud has been eradicated, right?", "If that’s been eradicated, it makes sense that it’s not included in this bill but, again, what are you doing to really address this situation? If they say the three major causes—one is organized crime, two is the health care providers and three is incidental. The incidental: The anti-fraud task force individual said that it’s pretty much negligible. It’s not a very significant part of it. It’s the first component and, to a lesser extent, the second, but that’s been mostly dealt with.", "If that’s what the anti-fraud task force is saying, “Here’s the evidence”—this is the task force entrusted with this responsibility to find out where the fraud is, what the fraud is, what does it look like and what’s going on, and they say it’s major crime, criminal elements, your solution is, “Let’s license insurance agents and adjusters.” How are you addressing that issue, then? That’s not what they said the problem was. They said that the problem was much bigger than that.", "That’s a clear example of distraction. You’re putting an element in this bill that doesn’t address fraud at all. It shows that you’re not committed to actually addressing this problem and it shows very clearly what your priorities are.", "Now, I do give you credit—and I think after going on for a good 45 minutes of a lot of criticism, I should give you some credit. The towing industry is certainly an industry where there are a lot of concerns. I spoke to a couple of tow truck drivers recently and they told me very clearly that there are certain practices going on that they’ve complained about time and time again. This is the tow truck industry itself.", "If you look at any industry—and I’m sure you all have experience in various professions—I would say the vast majority of any profession, the vast majority of people are trying to live an honest life, trying to make ends meet for their families and trying to live a decent and honourable life. I think most people want to do that, if they can. They try their best to do so.", "Anyone who is part of a particular profession wants to ensure their profession is looked upon favourably. No one wants their profession to have a bad reputation; no one wants that. The average person doesn’t want that; the majority of people don’t want that. They want their profession to be respected. Tow truck drivers themselves know that there are certain bad elements in the tow truck industry, and there are some bad systems in place that are encouraging bad players. In fact, if you have a bad system, it creates a bad culture. So they agree that there is a bad culture around certain activities in the tow truck industry.", "But they’ve complained about it. They’ve raised these issues. These aren’t new issues. They’ve said that there are certain agreements that go on that are inappropriate, where a tow truck driver has an agreement to take a truck to a certain facility or a certain garage against the will of the driver, of the owner of the vehicle. They’ve told you about this, time and time again. There are certain people who use tactics where they bully other truck drivers away and they try to enforce a quasi monopoly over a certain region by bullying tactics. They’ve told you about this. I’ve met with tow truck drivers who have said, “We’ve complained about this regularly, but there’s no action taken by this government.”", "I applaud you for at least addressing some of the concerns. One of the biggest components of tow and storage services that I think is warranted, and it has been long in need, is the tow and storage consumer bill of rights. On this component, I want to encourage you to look at some of the other stakeholders involved and ensure that you get a broader picture of the problem so that you can address it once and for all.", "I also have another suggestion for you. There are certain non-contentious components of this bill. If you would cleave out the towing and storage component, the insurance agents and adjusters component and the repair and storage liens, put that in a separate bill, the “minor, tiny steps towards making a little bit of a dent in fighting fraud act,” we could support that, because that would be more accurate—the “taking minor, somewhat insignificant steps to addressing fraud act.” Sure. I would vote for that. I would have no problem with voting for that. And it would say exactly what it did.", "But your very ambitious name for the bill doesn’t really fit what’s in it. I am hoping people will take a little closer look and see that most of this is the “increasing the profit margin for insurance companies bill” and the “pretending that we’re doing something more than that by throwing in a couple of other components act.” That’s really what we’re looking at, and I’m hoping that my 50 minutes have shown some people that there are some holes in this bill.", "Let’s talk about some of the other issues around auto insurance that I would have liked to have seen you look at.", "One of the biggest problems and one of the most important things we need to look at, if you really want to fix the auto insurance industry, is—we’ve already come to this point. If you accept that if the government mandates something—the government also has a responsibility to regulate that thing. If you mandate that people have to have auto insurance, we should also mandate that it’s delivered in a fair way. Do you agree with that? Let’s hope that you agree with that.", "How can you regulate an industry? What are some of the things you need to know that go on in the industry? One of the things that there’s current evidence on is that you track—and at the government, we track—what the premiums are that are received, what’s coming in to insurance companies, you track that; and you track what’s going out, what’s being paid out. It makes a lot of sense, right? You’ve got to know what the companies are paying out and you’ve got to know what’s going in.", "Why do you want to know that? You want to know that because you want to know if the insurance industry is making a profit or not. That’s really what it comes down to. If the insurance company is making colossal profits, then you could say: “Hey, listen. You’re making colossal profits on a product that we’ve mandated by law that people have to have. It’s kind of unfair for you to make a killing off of them. Maybe you could reduce those premiums a bit.”", "You need to know what the profits are, you would think. That seems to be logical, right? That’s the only reason. Why else would you be keeping data on the premiums that are being received by insurance companies and the payouts? You’re doing that so you have a picture of what the profits are.", "Well, guess what? Though you have a very clear picture of the premiums coming in and the costs going out, you actually don’t have—this government does not have—a clear handle on what the profits are. In fact, in committee we spent a large portion of time arguing about those profits.", "Why is it possibly acceptable to not know what an industry is making in profits if you’re trying to regulate it? How could there ever be a debate on that? How can you set rates if you don’t know what the companies are making? How can FSCO do its job? If FSCO can’t tell me clearly what the profits are, how can they set regulations? How can they set the rates? It makes no sense.", "In fact, it’s not just a problem limited to FSCO; the insurance industry itself can’t get it right.", "They commissioned a report. They said, “Listen, we’ll tell you what our profits are.” There’s no bias here. The Insurance Bureau of Canada, the lobby group for all the insurance companies of Canada, paid an auditor to give them a report on what the profits are—probably no bias there at all. There’s probably no sort of vested interest in the insurance lobbyists for the entire country paying an auditor to tell them what their profits are. It sounds totally reasonable to me, doesn’t it? I’m being sarcastic here. I don’t know if that’s going to be picked up by Hansard. Please insert sarcasm to the previous four sentences.", "There are two auditors, KPMG and J. S. Cheng. They both are dealing with the exact same companies and they’re asked to come up with their profits. KPMG’s report indicates a 2012 profit of $417 million, and J. S. Cheng indicates it’s actually $629 million—just a $200-million difference. No big deal. So what, right?" ],

That’s the difference between posting a loss or posting a profit. These are the auditors that were paid by the insurance companies to tell the world and Ontario what their profits were, and they couldn’t come up with the same numbers.", "So how are you regulating this industry? You don’t know how much they’re making. If I tell you they’re making a profit, you can’t even tell me they’re not making a profit without relying on their numbers. But you’re the government. You’re supposed to be independent. You should have a handle on how much these companies are making.", "One of our proposals was to figure out what they’re making and to figure out a true picture of their profits. And not just their profits in Canada because, God bless the insurance companies, but if they make a loss in another province, that’s not our problem here in Ontario. If they lose because there’s been a tragic flooding in another province or some other serious problem or disaster, that’s shouldn’t affect the drivers in Ontario. We should set our rates in Ontario based on the automobile insurance product of Ontario. That’s what our responsibility is. We should look at the profits they’re making on auto insurance here and whether or not there should be a reduction in those rates based on what they’re making here in Ontario. That’s only fair.", "I encourage you to take the step to figure out what are the profits of the industry that you’re purporting to regulate so that you can actually make an informed decision about that. That would be my suggestion, my humble suggestion. I think it makes some sense. I hope you’ll take a look at it.", "I want to go back now to talk about some of the unfairness in the system. This is an important element. If you have a system that, again, is mandatory, there has got to be criteria and factors that are used that are fair. We have certain factors right now that are used, and they make sense. You have your driving record. The driving record can predict whether or not you’re going to get in an accident or not. That’s fair. You have things like years of experience. That makes sense. It’s a fair criterion. If you drive for a number of years you’re more likely to have more experience and you’ll know how to handle certain circumstances, so your premiums can be lower.", "These criteria make sense; there are certain criteria that don’t make sense. I want to challenge the criteria of territorial ratings. There are certain differences that are fair and there are certain differences that are not fair. The way it works right now, if you live in southwestern Ontario, northern Ontario or in rural communities, those are significantly different and they should be treated differently. That makes sense. They’re completely different. You compare the GTA, which has the largest density of population and the largest density of cars in the entire province—yes, the GTA is different than southwestern Ontario. It’s different than northern Ontario and eastern Ontario. It is different. That’s fair. But now let’s look at the GTA itself.", "The GTA is pretty homogenous. We have some major highways that we all take. The 401 cuts across east-west. You have the 427 that goes north-south, and you have the Don Valley Parkway that goes north-south as well, and you have the Gardiner that takes you into Toronto. Everybody uses those highways to get around. Whether you live in Scarborough, whether you live in Brampton, whether you live in Mississauga, whether you live in York South–Weston, you are taking one of these highways, and the 400. You’re taking a 400-series highway, you’re taking the Gardiner, and you’re getting around on those, and we know that people in Ontario move around a lot. You might live in one part of the city and you might work in another part of the city. So the idea that you can see someone in a particular part of the greater Toronto area paying twice as much as another part just defies logic to me. How is it possible that you can have one place being charged twice as much as another place within a 20- or 30-minute radius? It’s all the same area.", "I wanted to figure out why this is going on. I tried to uncover this a bit, and I want to tell you a very troubling story. This is something that I think is quite concerning, and I hope it concerns you as much as it concerns me. We asked the insurance industry point blank, “Okay, tell us about the way this thing works. How does this insurance thing work?” We asked them, “Our understanding is, if someone has life insurance or disability insurance, if they’re injured, the requirement is that they have to tap into their life insurance or disability insurance first, before going to the auto insurance.” The insurance industry said, “Yes, that’s correct.”", "I said, “Okay, let me back up for a second. If I have life insurance or disability insurance and I get injured, you’re not going to pay out of my auto insurance; you’re going to pay out of my life insurance and disability insurance first?” They said, “Yes.”", "“What about if certain communities that have a higher population of people who are better off, who are more well paid and have more life insurance or disability insurance, and other parts of the city where there are people who don’t have life insurance, don’t have disability insurance and are less likely to have it? If you have a density of people with life insurance, will they cost you less?” Answer: “Yes.”", "There are certain areas in the city where there are folks who are wealthier—and there’s no fault that they are wealthier—and have a higher likelihood of having life insurance or disability insurance, who are paying less auto insurance premiums, and certain areas where they have no life insurance because they are working poor and having difficult times, and they are paying higher auto insurance rates. If this is true, that’s a serious travesty, and something needs to be done about it." ],

Our target is to try and reduce rates by 15% by next August. Sadly, we’d be closer to achieving that target, those goals, had the NDP unfortunately not forced the election and stalled the passage of this bill, so we’d be seeing those savings sooner.", "We have heard some very creative interpretations from the NDP member across the floor on where he thinks car insurance rates are at, but I say this to you as a former journalist with 36 years’ experience. When I report information, I do so based on a foundation of fact, so please know this to be a fact: Rates are down by 6% on average since August 2013, and, like I said, we are on track to try and reach our 15% rate reduction by next summer.", "There’s a very interesting tweet that was put out by one of his colleagues.

He had some excellent ideas, and it’s unfortunate that those couldn’t have been incorporated into a bill.", "However, with respect to this bill, the problem is that we have fraud in insurance, and it seems to be that organized crime in certain parts of Ontario is the cause of what’s happening here. Towing charges for damaged cars are exorbitantly high in some cases. Storage charges are high—body shop charges, health care clinics, legal services. They are falsely inflated, or service is not even provided—and it’s with very organized people who are successful at defrauding insurance companies with high claims.", "We must be careful, as we try to correct this matter, not to paint everybody in the industry—towing cars, storing them, autobody shops, health clinics and legal services—with the negative brush of criminal activity. Most people are doing a fair and reasonable job—fair work at a fair price. So we want to be careful of that, Mr. Speaker.", "I think if I could make one comment, let’s appreciate the people out there who are of good character and integrity, doing a good job, providing a fair service at a fair price.

I would submit that the title should be changed to the “it’s a great day to be an insurance company in the province of Ontario bill,” because they are going to continue to benefit at the expense of drivers in this province.

We could have moved this bill along if we didn’t have this election.", "But going forward, let me provide some historical context to the members who are here today. In 2013, this government made a commitment to reducing insurance rates. That was 2013. A year later, the government continued to work on reducing auto insurance rates as part of its strategy. We also accepted the recommendations from the Honourable Mr. Justice Cunningham to the Minister of Finance regarding the transformation of auto insurance, particularly the statutory accident benefits in terms of the dispute resolution process.", "The other piece is that government has consistently been in support of and acted on the task force’s recommendations, one of them involving the establishment of the special investigation unit—which the Attorney General, previously the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, had been involved with—the special unit on dealing with serious frauds, including auto insurance fraud. We know the OPP, working with the various police detachments, including Toronto police, have been active on this particular matter.

We need efforts from all the different ministries, but collectively we have to combat this problem. We are dealing with a very difficult and challenging file.", "With my time, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk, first of all, about dealing with the tow and storage services. As is clearly stated in Bill 15, it talks specifically about the tow and storage services, which is a huge problem.", "I want to just share with the members here today that about two years ago I had a car accident, was rear-ended after leaving Queen’s Park. There were three cars involved, but somehow there were five tow trucks. Okay? Five tow trucks, Mr. Speaker, all trying to get my service and to be towed. They said, “Oh, there’s no cost, ma’am.

Somebody’s paying for this tow.” So we have to be very mindful.", "That’s why in the proposed legislation, if passed, we will require disclosure of information to the consumer, with requirements that tow and storage services provided to consumers be authorized, because we know that many of our constituents out there whose first language is not English are not aware about this piece. So they have to be authorized before the towing services can be provided. Deviation from the estimate payment amount, the provision of itemized invoices—again, more transparency, more information to the consumer. Insurance requirements, publication of the rates—how many times do you get a bill and you don’t know what that rate is?", "Then, last but not least, the bill also proposes dealing with a tow and storage consumer bill of rights, again protecting consumers, because at the end of the day, the consumer has been affected greatly by these kinds of potential problems called fraud.", "That’s the first part of Bill 15.", "The other piece in the proposed legislation, if passed, deals specifically with the Highway Traffic Act. I cannot say enough about this particular amendment, because we know that each one of us drives Ontario highways to and from work or in our own personal lives. So if the legislation is passed, it focuses on two amendments.", "First, it deals with the regulation of commercial motor vehicles and tow trucks and enforcement of the act. There will be additional fines and penalties if the legislation is passed. We heard all kinds of nightmare stories on the 400-series highways where tow truck operators, whatever the reasons, will be doing illegal activities on the road or those good operators are being intimidated. At the end of the day, if the legislation is passed, there will be additional protection—" ],

At the end of the day, one or two bad apples out there are now causing all the problems for all of us.", "The other big portion of the legislation, if passed, deals specifically with the Insurance Act. This is a big section of the proposed legislation. Let me go through that first part. It deals specifically with dispute resolution, which the task force also recommended. The dispute resolution is very, very comprehensive. The proposed legislation talks about eliminating the office of the Financial Services Commission of Ontario under the director of arbitration. I know my colleague opposite earlier talked about how there will be many layers, many offices created because of the proposed legislation. That’s not true. If the legislation is passed, they will be eliminating one of the offices in FSCO.", "The other piece under dispute resolution: We’re talking about allowing the Licence Appeal Tribunal, better known as LAT, to conduct hearings regarding the statutory accident benefit disputes, allowing the appeals of the LAT decisions to Divisional Court on questions of the law—so again, allowing the opportunity for residents or constituents who are appealing a decision of the Licence Appeal Tribunal.", "The other piece here is that under this dispute resolution, it will limit court proceedings other than appeals to the LAT decisions or applications to judicial review. We have heard many times—because this bill has been in the finance committee numerous times, having sat on the committee the last three years. It has been going on and on. We heard witness after witness asking us, pleading with this House to get on with the business of serving the people—" ],

Certainly not helping the people who have been affected by it.", "This proposed dispute resolution also allows the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to assess the insurer for the expenditures and expenses by the LAT related to these disputes. Again, there have been concerns raised. I recall hearing a couple of the witnesses to the committee—and remember, this committee travelled across the province and we consistently heard these concerns.", "Again, this particular dispute resolution also talks about the various transition and regulation-making provisions governing the resolution of disputes, meaning a more timely period and limiting the period of disputes. We hear that so many of these court disputes get dragged on, and for what purpose? At the end of the day, those who are suffering because the decision is not being made or made too long are the clients, who are our constituents, and they are asking for timely responses to their hearings.", "The other piece about the Insurance Act that is very, very clear—I know my colleague opposite talked about concerns raised about the prejudgment interest piece. There will be a new section under 258.3, subsection (8.1), that talks about governing the interest rates to be used. This does not apply with respect to the prejudgment interest. Again, we heard about this kind of request when we were at committee.", "The other piece of the Insurance Act that will be amended, if the legislation is passed, deals with agents’ licences. I don’t know about you, but we hear so many concerns and challenges about the brokers’ licences and the different classifications. If passed, the proposed legislation will have classes of licences available, and it will govern the agents as well as the scope of practice of each licensee.", "Again, it also provides some direction for the superintendent of FSCO, that he can refuse to issue a licence or revoke a licence—again, strengthening his role and also ensuring that the agents who are practising as insurance agents for auto insurance follow the letter of the law. We are very, very concerned about making sure that insurance operators, from the agents themselves, follow the letter of the law and strengthen the role of the superintendent, allowing him or her to investigate." ],

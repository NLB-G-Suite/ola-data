We have created almost 800,000 jobs since the recession and our unemployment rate has been below the national average for 34 months. But we know that not everyone is feeling the benefits of that prosperity. Over the past number of years, I have spoken with many of my constituents in my riding of Brampton–Springdale about how the nature of their work has changed. They are working so hard to put food on their table, take care of their children and pay their bills, but are finding that money runs out before the month ends.", "That isn’t right. Those who are earning minimum wage shouldn’t have to worry about making ends meet. While the party opposite doesn’t agree with this, I strongly believe that everyone who works for 35 or 40 hours a week deserves to earn a decent wage. They shouldn’t have to struggle to get by.", "It’s disappointing that the party opposite doesn’t agree. Despite the economy doing so well, they still don’t think it is the time to raise the minimum wage. They believe that it is too soon. They believe that $15 is too much. They want families of Ontario and families in my riding of Brampton–Springdale to wait even longer, although they won’t say for how long. I cannot disagree with this more. The families in Brampton–Springdale cannot afford to wait.", "A delay in raising the minimum wage to $15 is a denial. Rolling back the increase to the minimum wage will take money away from minimum wage workers. This is money that they rely on for food, rent and day-to-day expenses. This is why I am so proud that our government is committed to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour on January 1, 2019. We are standing up for workers, we are making changes that will protect and support them, and we will not back down from that commitment.", "There are a number of reasons. I know, over the last little while, we’ve had opportunities to meet with our constituents to hold all sorts of consultations. I actually travelled with Bill 148 when we talked about minimum wage. It’s important to Ontarians. It’s important to our economy, to our students and to everybody across the province. We want to ensure that everybody has a fair chance and everybody is able to put food on the table for their children and for their families, and that they are able to live a good style of living. We have taken on an approach to affordable living in Ontario which has many prongs to it, whether it be free tuition, free pharmacare, and minimum wage. We have taken an opportunity to do this.", "Before I continue, I do want to let you know that I’ll be sharing my time with the member for Kingston and the Islands.", "When people say that increasing the minimum wage will reduce employment, that’s not true. As the minimum wage rises, workers become more attracted and labour turnover rates and absenteeism tend to decline. These people are taking this money and spending it back in our economy, which is going to strengthen our economy and build a better Ontario, a stronger Ontario, and one where people have an equal opportunity to be able to afford the things they need. These people are going to go out and buy their kids that new pair of shoes, or put food on the table for them. This isn’t money that they are putting away or storing. When they are making $14 to $15 an hour, this is money that they need for their day-to-day expenses. This is the money that they need to make ends meet so they don’t feel at the end of the month that they don’t know where their next meal is coming from.", "We want to give Ontarians an opportunity for a good life. We want to make sure that every child has breakfast on the table before they go off to school. It’s important to us that we continue to work on this. It’s important to us that we support Ontarians and we listen to them. We’ve taken the time to do this. It’s not too soon. It’s the right thing to do, and this is the right time to do it. We’re in this together.", "We are looking for ways to build a better life, with all of our children. Coming from the school board, I know, when there is not a stable income coming in to the family, how much it impacts the child’s life every day when they come to school and haven’t had that fresh breakfast. When there’s stress at home, it reflects on the child and it reflects on the whole family unit. We want to be able to strengthen families, strengthen Ontario and build a better lifestyle.", "These are the reasons that we need to do this. We need to strengthen our economy. We need to build Ontario up. We need to give everybody that opportunity to earn a decent living in Ontario, live above the poverty line and be able to afford a decent lifestyle—a lifestyle where, like I said before, they can put food on the table and not worry about their day-to-day expenses. Our government, as I’ve said, has taken that approach. We are trying to build a fair and equitable society for everybody.", "When it comes to tuition, we want to give everybody that opportunity to go out and get a post-secondary education and not worry about how they’re going to pay for it. Every child should have that right to dream. Everybody should have to work together; it’s our joint responsibility to provide those opportunities. It’s our responsibility as a government.", "The work world has changed so much over the last 25 years.

So there are supporting examples that will show us that the increase in minimum wage does not mean lower employment levels. There have been a number of supporting factors saying that this will not lead to this.", "We’ll say that, when people say minimum wage is not fair—it is fair. We have many people in our province who are already paying a living wage, and we heard from them when we did our consultations on Bill 148. They understand how important it is to be a fair employer and provide their staff and their employees with a living wage, as opposed to what we’re now having as minimum wage. We’ve heard from communities across the province, and we know that, with the $14 minimum wage, many, many people have benefited, and they will continue to benefit when we move over to $15. I’ve talked to business owners in my riding, I’ve talked to constituents in my riding, and I know that they are so excited to be able to be take advantage of this.", "I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak on this.

We’re all very proud of this opportunity, and I’m pleased to work with you in the future on all issues pertaining to women’s affairs. So congratulations, officially.", "I am very pleased to stand in support of this motion. I think that it is, as the minister has said, extremely important that we have brought it forward and that Bill 148 has passed. It’s absolutely critical for our economy. We have heard many times before in this House that our economy is doing well and that Ontario is leading the G7 in economic growth. We’ve heard countless times as well that we have created almost 800,000 jobs since the recession—800,000 jobs—and we have done so without raising taxes. Our unemployment rate has been below the national average for 34 consecutive months. That’s almost three years. This is something to be incredibly proud of.", "But we’ve also heard in this House that not everybody is benefiting from this economy in the same way. Many people who were working in minimum wage jobs were being left behind. There are some incredible challenges for individuals, for families, for single mothers, who have been trying to survive on $11.60 an hour. It’s not fair. It’s not possible to support a family on that kind of income.", "As many in this House know, previous to my role as an MPP I worked in a federal office for seven years. I have been listening to the concerns of constituents in Kingston and the Islands for seven years on a daily basis, every single day, and I can promise you that my days then and my days now are not eight hours a day. I have been hearing concerns from people who have been trying to survive at a poverty level and working full-time. They have to worry about putting food on the table and they have to worry about child care, but they are also not able to provide their children with recreational opportunities and cultural opportunities that many other people in the community have been able to. So that’s another reason why Bill 148 and motion 61 are very, very important for people in our community. We know it’s not right that minimum wage workers cannot survive while working full-time. They shouldn’t have to worry about making ends meet.", "The party opposite doesn’t agree with us. I strongly believe that if you work 35 hours or more a week, you deserve a minimum wage. You shouldn’t have to struggle to get by, to pay for your own survival or that of your family. It’s disappointing that we don’t all agree. It’s important in this Legislature that we be able to debate these issues and that we bring forward concerns. We all have a particular lens that we view different subjects with, but we need to come together to support Ontarians. When the economy is doing well, it is critical that we make sure people can manage. Families in Ontario and families in Kingston and the Islands can’t wait. A delay in raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is a denial that it is critically important for Ontarians. Rolling back the increase is going to take money away from minimum wage workers.", "That is why I am very, very proud that our government is committed to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour on January 1, 2019. We’re standing up for workers in Ontario. We have their backs. I have seen that our Premier has the backs of Ontarians in countless other issues as well. We’re looking at OHIP+, where we’re protecting children and youth under the age of 25 to receive pharmacare. That is critically important as well, and that is also going to help families. We’re also supporting students through the OSAP program. That is evidence that this government has the backs of Ontarians, and Bill 148 and motion 61 supporting the minimum wage increase is more evidence that we bring forward in this Legislature today to show that we have the backs of Ontarians. We will not back down from that commitment.", "There have been a number of different approaches and comments that we have received from different stakeholders across this province. I’m just going to go over a few of those. I think that it’s extremely important to make sure that other voices are brought forward in this Legislature. There are small business owners who favour raising the minimum wage. I’ve got some in my community. Minotaur is a store on Princess Street which was, right out of the gate, public in their support of the minimum wage. They have an absolutely fantastic staff that is very committed to that business.", "That is one of the things we are seeing through the minimum wage: that employers who have come out and supported this initiative, who have provided their employees—employees who make their living—they have come forward and they have benefited from being public and from supporting their employees in this manner.", "I digress.", "Employers that support minimum wage—in 2014, the American Sustainable Business Council and Business for a Fair Minimum Wage said that 53% of small business owners believe that with a higher minimum wage, businesses would benefit from lower employee turnover and increased productivity and customer satisfaction.", "And I can say this with absolute certainty because I had a business, as well. I understand the concern of being a business owner. When I had my store in Toronto in the 1980s, I provided some of my employees with $15 an hour. That was in the 1980s. I saw that employee satisfaction. My employees were there for me when I needed them. When they dealt with customers who came into my store, they treated my shop as if it was their own. That’s the kind of loyalty and dedication that comes when employers invest in their employees and provide a living wage, or a sustainable wage, a minimum wage that they can survive on.", "David A. Green from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives said in April 2015 that a $15 minimum wage would significantly boost the income of low-wage workers as a group and is large enough to lift full-time workers out of poverty. A raise to $15 would mostly affect non-teenagers and would therefore have a much greater impact on working poverty. We have seen this. We know this is true. We know that the individuals who are at that minimum wage scale are staying in the community. Their discretionary income is being spent in the community. That will benefit all of our small businesses.", "“Why Increasing the Minimum Wage Does Not Necessarily Reduce Employment,” Alan Manning, Social Europe, January 2014: “As the minimum wage rises and work becomes more attractive, labour turnover rates and absenteeism tend to decline.”", "“Minimum Wage Effects Across State Borders: Estimates Using Contiguous Counties,” Arindrajit Dube, T. William Lester and Michael Reich, in 2010—we’re going way back in time. This is 2018. From that report, it was stated that the results were clear. These basic economic indicators show no correlation between federal minimum wage increases and lower employment levels, even in the industries that are most impacted by higher minimum wages. That was eight years ago.", "So when we think about why the minimum wage has no discernible effect on employment—that is one of the common things that we’ve been hearing.", "John Schmitt from the Center for Economic and Policy Research said in 2013:", "“Across all of the empirical research that has investigated the issue, minimum wage increases are consistently associated with statistically significant and economically meaningful increases in the wages of affected workers....", "“The research conducted since the early 1990s concludes that the minimum wage has little or no discernible effect on the employment prospects of low-wage workers.”", "When you look at another comment, from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2015, three years ago: “Economic growth has disproportionately benefited higher-income groups while lower-income households have been left behind. This long-run increase in income inequality tends to drag down the GDP growth due to the rising distance of the lower 40% of the rest of society.”", "Another comment, from Arindrajit Dube, T. William Lester and Michael Reich, in a report from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2014, four years ago: “Turnover rates for teens and restaurant workers fall substantially following a minimum wage increase, declining by 2% for every 10% increase in minimum wage.”", "The Financial Diaries: How American Families Cope in a World of Uncertainty, Jonathan Morduch, in 2017 said, “Since the 1970s, steady work that pays a predictable and living wage has become increasingly difficult to find. This shift has left many more families vulnerable to income volatility.”", "It’s important to focus on that word “predictability.” As a family, if you’re a single mother, if you have children—one, two or more children—you cannot manage your family expenses if you don’t have an income that allows you to plan, that allows you to make sure that you can provide good, sustainable food for your family, or that you might be able to provide recreational opportunities for your children—maybe enrol them in soccer or enrol them in hockey.", "I’ve got a grandson who is four. He’s engaged in gymnastics. You can see the benefit that he has from being engaged in that way, from being active and healthy. I’m sure it’s going to pay dividends when he’s in school. He’s now in junior kindergarten. I can tell you that it’s an absolute delight to see him engaged in that way. He looks forward to it. But if you don’t have an income that allows you to plan, that is predictable, there’s no opportunity to even consider taking those kinds of sport activities and being engaged in that way.", "Those who benefit from a minimum wage are important to talk about. The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives said in 2017, “Controversy over the $15 minimum wage tends to focus on the stress it will place on mom-and-pop shops, but the data show that these represent a small portion of the firms where employees will see a raise. Almost 50% work for companies with 500 or more employees.”", "A case study was brought forward from the fast food industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. David Card and Alan Krueger, in the American Economic Review, found, in September 1994, “no indication that the rise in minimum wage reduced employment”—in 1994.", "“Publication Selection Bias in Minimum-Wage Research? A Meta-Regression Analysis” states, in the British Journal of Industrial Relations, “little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment.”", "I could go on. There is an incredible volume of resources that support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The minister of women’s affairs has brought forward motion 61, and I think that it’s a very important thing that we support that. I know that there’s a lot of opposition from the opposition on this issue. It’s very important that we bring forward some of the different approaches that have been discussed, especially in this interesting political time.", "Every single political Conservative leadership candidate has spoken up and promised that a $15 minimum wage is not happening in 2019. Instead of acknowledging that people are working full-time yet struggling to pay rent, put food on the table or care for their families, they are all saying that they will stop the $15 minimum wage. Christine Elliott said that she would hold off on the increase for 2019; Doug Ford and Tanya Granic Allen told workers, flat out, “Nope” to the raise; and Caroline Mulroney said that she would put the brakes on that much needed raise for workers, slowing it down to a quarter a year.", "Unlike them, we know that this raise can’t wait. How are we, as representatives of our community, going to go back to our community when people come forward in our constituency offices and say to us, “This has been rolled back—I can’t manage. What are you going to do about it?” That cannot happen.", "This government will continue to stand up for Ontarians across this province on the minimum wage, on OHIP+ and on OSAP, and our Premier has the backs of Ontarians. I know, Mr. Speaker, that you know that, so thank you.", "Now is the time to ensure our most vulnerable are sharing in our plan to create more fairness and opportunity for everyone. As I said in the beginning of my discussion this morning, Ontario’s economy is doing well. We all know the numbers: 800,000 jobs have been created since the recession, and our growth has been outpacing Canada and the G7 nations. We cannot say that often enough, because that is a fact. We also know that recent analysis from Scotiabank shows that there is no discernable evidence of a minimum wage impact on hours worked in Ontario so far.", "The entire opposition caucus voted against fair workplaces and better jobs last year, and now every leadership candidate in the Conservative caucus has promised to cancel the $15 minimum wage increase.", "It’s clear that we need to put the focus of everyday Ontarians first. We need to help them put food on the family’s table. We need to increase fairness and create opportunity for everyone. We need to allow those families who want to provide healthy food for their family—we want to see those families in the grocery stores not packing up their grocery carts with pasta but with healthy food. With a $15 minimum wage, free pharmacare for everyone under the age of 25, free tuition for hundreds of thousands of students and better, more affordable child care, we are making Ontario a better and fairer place to live.", "Our government is committed to protecting these values, and we can hear it every day in this Legislature, in this chamber, from every single minister on this side of the House and, particularly, from our Premier.

At the same time, we well know—it’s been mentioned many times in this House—that not all Ontarians are feeling this prosperity and that this is not reflected in their everyday life and in the reality that they live every day.", "There is a sense of inequality, that we have not been keeping up with the times. I also want to mention that in Toronto I have heard and read in many reports that a living wage is actually $16 an hour. So living in an urban centre like Toronto, $15 an hour would not even be considered a living wage. This is why my colleagues have made the point that people cannot wait. They cannot wait any longer. It is a government’s responsibility to try to make sure that no one is left behind, that everybody can share in the prosperity, especially when the economy is doing well, as is happening at the moment.", "Mr. Speaker, I think back to early 2007 when I first ran for office. I ran in a by-election that I lost in February 2007. During that by-election, one of the main issues that were being discussed was an increase in the minimum wage. At that time, our government was still reflecting on that and was analyzing the reports and whether that was going to be possible. At that time, the government did not promise the increase until the general election. In the general election, which I did win in 2007, we had promised an increase in minimum wage, which happened. We increased it seven times after that and it did not have an impact on jobs until then for other reasons; we hit 2008 and the recession.", "I want to say that it is important for people—because a lot has changed through time. At that time, if we look back about 10 years, the majority of people who were earning a minimum wage were students or people who chose to work part-time. If we now fast-forward the clock to today, we see, in communities such as the one that I have the privilege to represent, that the people who are earning minimum wage are actually families that are working full-time, families that are working two or three jobs; you’ll have newcomers to Canada; you’ll have single mothers with children. It’s hard for them to make ends meet. So we need to bear the responsibility to take care of them and to make sure that they too can have access to the prosperity that everyone else is feeling.", "In the past year and a half or two years, I have met with many advocates, many groups, many religious groups, but more importantly with residents, with constituents, who have brought forward what their situation is currently. There are many people who had been advocating for this before the government made the decision—the right decision—because it is only fitting that we do not leave anyone behind.", "We’re celebrating the lunar new year. Many communities in Ontario—that is so diverse—during the past few weeks have been celebrating the lunar new year. I went with my colleague Sue Wong, MPP for Scarborough–Agincourt, and MPP Mike Colle, my colleague from Eglinton–Lawrence, to one of the local grocery stores in my area to wish the people a happy lunar new year, a happy Chinese New Year, just last week. People were shopping. A gentleman near the cashier recognized me as his local MPP and said, “Do you see how busy the grocery store is, MPP Albanese? Everyone has a little more money in their pocket.” I could just see joy in his face.", "I’m just talking about a real example. I’m trying to bring a real example to this House because sometimes when we talk, it would seem that we’re talking about prosperity, about inequality, but we’re not translating that to what people are actually living in their everyday life.", "Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more with the fact that this needs to happen. It cannot be rolled back. People need help. This is why our government has been trying to put forward initiatives to try to help families in the best way possible, for example, through free tuition for 250,000 students who could not otherwise afford it, through free prescription drugs for young people under 25. These are concrete initiatives that help families get by and help them, with dignity, reach a little more success in their own lives. That’s very important.", "As Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, I see a lot of newcomers to this country. I talk to a lot of them. I was once an immigrant myself. When you first arrive here, you’re very busy trying to make ends meet. You’re very busy trying to set roots in the city, in the country, and you’re trying to raise your family. You want the best opportunities for your children. This is why you came here, to have a better future, not only for yourself but for your family and especially for your children, and every little bit counts. It makes a big difference.", "When you first arrive, you don’t usually have the network to get the best job that would be available to you. Many immigrants can share a history of having to accept the first job that was offered to them, and then they slowly build their way up to finding a job in the field they studied for and becoming a little more successful in their own setting. Whatever the government can do to help them to integrate and thrive in our society is very important. It is our duty. That’s why I think it is very important that we do not take the chance to roll back a minimum wage increase that makes such a big difference in people’s lives.", "I want to conclude by saying that—I should have mentioned that earlier; I’m sorry, Mr. Speaker—I wanted to share my time with the member from Mississauga East–Cooksville.

If somebody is working 40 hours a week full-time, they ought to be able to have a decent standard of living. They ought not to have to go to a food bank to feed their family. It’s as simple as that. Do we want an Ontario where somebody working full-time, eight hours a day, 40 hours a week still has to rely on a food bank to put food on the table for their families? I think we can all agree that’s not the kind of Ontario we want to live in. That’s why we have raised the minimum wage first to $14 this past January 1, 2018, and we will be raising it further to $15 an hour January 1, 2019. I have to say that of all the things that we in government have done—there are many, many things that I’m very proud of, but this one is particularly something that I feel strongly about.", "I also understand that for small businesses—we need to make sure that this transition is fair to them. That is why we came up with a robust small business package that includes reducing the small business tax by 1%.

We have eliminated the capital gains tax and we are making massive investments to ensure Ontario’s workforce remains highly skilled.", "One of the knocks that the Conservative Party sometimes makes brings Ontario down by saying that Ontario is not a competitive place to do business in. But all of the evidence shows that’s not the case. In fact, as it turns out, three out of the five top cities in North America to do business in happen to be in Ontario, a business-friendly place. The Ontario PC Party may not think that Ontario is a competitive place to do business in, but it turns out that the rest of the world does think that Ontario is a very competitive place to do business in, and we will continue to advocate for that.", "I also just wanted to say that often the debate on the minimum wage centres on that hourly wage increase, but along with it we made some very critical changes. One of the ones that I think is really good is that if somebody works for five years for one employer, they are entitled to three weeks’ vacation instead of the usual two weeks. I think we can all agree that that is something that is really important for work-life balance. We spend a significant amount of our lives working. I think it’s really important that we be able to take some time off to enjoy the fruits of our labour, so the three weeks’ vacation, I believe, is very welcome. I know we have all travelled and in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe, four or five weeks is the norm. When you consider the fact that it’s a 52-week year, three weeks is not an unreasonable amount of time. That is another one that I’m very supportive of.", "We have also said, equal pay for equal work. If somebody who is doing a part-time job is doing exactly the same thing as somebody who is doing a full-time job, fairness would suggest that the hourly wage be the same. Obviously, the take-home pay would be different because somebody is working fewer hours than full-time. But there’s no reason the hourly wage ought to be different if they’re doing the same job.", "These are some of the other changes that I think get lost in the debate around minimum wage. We’ve done a lot to improve and protect Ontario’s workers. As they say, you get what you pay for, and quality shouldn’t cost more in the long run. I think we can all agree that quality really shouldn’t cost us more in the long run and we get what we pay for. So if we pay our employees well, then we get good quality, which in the long run is actually cheaper than lower quality.", "There are so many different reasons to pay the minimum wage, and there’s a good business case to be made, but I think, to me, the most heartening thing is the human story. What is the point of growing our economy, what is the point of making our province richer, if that wealth is not going to be shared? Is Ontario a better place if our GDP increases but most of that increase goes to a select few places? Or is Ontario a better place if our GDP increases and that increase in wealth is more broadly shared?", "I think, as Liberals, we do believe that a rising tide should lift all boats, not just some boats. That is the spirit behind raising the minimum wage. It’s a small way of saying that those who are the most vulnerable, those who are often doing the jobs that many of us may not want to do, ought to get a little bit of the rising tide, that their boats, their standards of living, should also rise.", "I have met many of my residents. I have knocked on many doors over the past few months, often in high-rise buildings, because the weather is cold, so high-rise buildings are a good place to be knocking on doors, and I have yet to meet somebody in these buildings who has said, “Oh, I’m opposed to the minimum wage.” It’s not that everybody there is making the minimum wage—many are making more than the minimum wage—but they understand how hard it is in today’s Toronto, in today’s Mississauga, to live on $11.60 an hour. It’s just not possible. So we have made a good start and I’m very proud of this.", "I’m a little disappointed that all of the leadership candidates in the PC race are saying that they are going to hold off on raising the minimum wage to $15 on January 1, 2019. I have to ask why. Why would you deny the most vulnerable of Ontarians the dignity that should come with working full-time? If you are working 40 hours a week, eight hours a day—why would you deny these people the dignity of not being forced to go to a food bank to put food on the table? That’s the simple question. You have to ask yourself: Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of the vast majority of Ontarians or not? I understand that there are many stakeholders as we raise the $15 minimum wage. There are ways to balance the needs and concerns of all of the stakeholders. But why would you deny a raise to the poorest of the poor?", "My only question to the PC Party would be, if you are going to say that somehow Ontario should not increase the minimum wage, would you say the same for all of the CEOs in Ontario? Would you say that you’re against a raise for all of the CEOs in the year 2019?" ],

I’m very pleased to rise in the House today and add my voice to the debate that is being had in the House today.", "I think it’s everyone’s knowledge that many business leaders from across the world are choosing to invest in Ontario. This is because we have a vibrant and diversified economy, a very competitive corporate tax regime and some of the most highly educated and skilled workers in the world. Greater equality, which our plan seeks to do, is foundational for a strong economy. Putting more money in the hands of hard-working Ontarians is always good for businesses. By creating more equitable workplaces, we’re making Ontario an even more attractive place to work and do business.", "What we are doing now will ensure that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from all the efforts we’ve made between government, businesses and workers, to benefit from these initiatives and share in the growth of the economy.", "To do that, we have taken various steps and put some investments into place. We eliminated the capital tax. We reduced the small business corporate income tax rate. We’re investing $190 billion over 13 years in infrastructure. We’re committed to keeping our corporate income taxes competitive. We’re making massive investments to ensure that Ontario’s workforce remains highly skilled. Through the fair hydro plan, 500,000 small businesses will be getting 25% off their electricity bills.", "Our economy is doing very well. We are leading the G7 in economic growth, and, as has already been said in this House this morning, we’ve created almost 800,000 jobs since the recession. Our unemployment rate has been below the national average for 34 months.", "But we know that not everyone is feeling the benefits of that prosperity. We have millions of workers in Ontario who are finding it almost impossible to support their families on a minimum wage that just doesn’t go far enough. It is time that this rate reflected the reality of people’s lives. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour gives 30% of Ontarians a pay increase, ensuring that more workers are benefiting from Ontario’s economic growth. A $15 minimum wage phased in over 18 months is good for workers, but it can also be good for businesses too. When businesses pay fairly, living standards rise and reliance on benefits falls. Higher wages also lead to greater job satisfaction and productivity, less turnover and more spending power for lower-income earners.", "Beyond the positive impact, the minimum wage increase speaks to our values. It’s about equal opportunity, ensuring that those who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded. It’s our job as government to make sure our society reflects those values. Whether it’s child care or health care, rent control or workplace fairness, the motivation behind them is the same: They all help to build an Ontario where greater opportunity is available for everyone and greater security is achievable for everyone.", "Over the past number of years, I’ve spoken with many of my constituents in my riding of Davenport about the nature of their work and how it has changed. I’ve also had the opportunity to meet on numerous occasions with the advocacy group Fight for $15 and Fairness, and had the opportunity to write to the Minister of Labour about the $15 minimum wage.", "Everyone I met with spoke about how hard they are working to put food on their table, take care of their children and pay the bills, but they are finding that the money runs out before the month ends. This isn’t right. Those who are earning minimum wage shouldn’t have to worry about making ends meet. While the party opposite doesn’t agree with this, I strongly believe that everyone who works 35 or 40 hours a week deserves to earn a decent wage. They shouldn’t have to struggle to get by. It’s disappointing that the party opposite doesn’t agree.", "We know that over the last few weeks, the PCs have made it clear that they would delay an increase to a $15 minimum wage, but they won’t say for how long. They think that $15 an hour is too much, and January 1 of next year is too soon. But we know that families of Ontario cannot afford to wait. My constituents cannot afford to wait. Delaying $15 an hour is the same as denying $15 an hour. We know that $15 an hour is not a livable wage in many city centres across this province. Families in my riding of Davenport are counting on this increase. This is money they rely on for food, for rent, for child care and for transit.", "Before January 1 of this year, 30% of Ontarians were making less than $15 an hour, and over half of those were between the ages of 24 and 64. Those are workers who are trying to raise families. I strongly believe that we need to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour on January 1, 2019.", "I’m proud that our government is standing up for workers and making changes that will support them. We won’t back down from our commitment. That’s why I’m so proud that our government is committed to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour on January 1, 2019.", "As a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs, I had the opportunity to travel this province in the summer and earlier this year, when we heard from various business owners about the $15 minimum wage. There was one particular presenter who stuck in my mind and whom I’ve quoted various times. Her name is Jessica Carpinoni. She’s the owner of Bread By Us, an artisan bakery and espresso bar in Ottawa. This is what she said:", "“I know, from experience opening my own bakery, that it is by no means simple and easy to run a small business. We didn’t start with much, had to make money quickly, and the personal sacrifices have been immense. However, I have always vowed that I would not build a business that did not prioritize above-average labour standards. And this to me, is really the key. We as entrepreneurs need to be forward-thinking and not build and model our businesses on poverty-level wages.”", "I want to thank Jessica for her presentation that day in Ottawa and for being an example for small businesses across this province that it is possible.", "Once again, I’m very proud that our government is committed to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour come January 1, 2019." ],

So instead of debating the business of the House this morning, we’re rehashing Bill 148.", "The reality is that everything the Liberals are talking about this morning has already been determined. It has been passed by law. It is the law today. It is the law that on January 1, the minimum wage went to $14, and on January 1, 2019, it will go to $15. That’s the law that this Legislature passed. If that’s going to change, then the law would have to be changed. But the matter has been determined.", "Boy, I heard an awful lot of stuff from Liberal members today who see this only through one side. The reason they do that is that this is so politically motivated. They talk about how they’re determined to have the backs of the vulnerable. They’re the party that cares about those people who are underpaid. But it’s interesting that they did nothing to raise this wage in any substantive way prior to the eve of the election—nothing.

Her hours were cut. She’s not blaming the business. In her letter, she’s blaming Kathleen Wynne for not even thinking about what the obvious effects of this would be. She used to make $382 a week, clear. With the minimum wage increase, she’s now making $380.16. So her wages didn’t go up; in fact, they went down slightly, because the taxes are more and her hours have been cut. She absolutely supports, 100%, her employer, who is trying to keep her and other people working but has no other choice but to cut their expenses, because the government just decided, “We’re going to send a social program onto the backs of small business, and they’re going to have to pay, because we need those votes in June 2018.” It was irresponsible. It was not well thought-out.", "They talk about niche businesses saying, “Oh, we pay our people more than $15 an hour.” Well, some people can afford to buy coffee at Starbucks, and some people can’t. Some people don’t want to pay $5 for a latte or a coffee or whatever. It’s just not in their DNA. If there are people who can go to niche businesses and pay exorbitant prices for products that are available elsewhere for a more reasonable price, so be it. If people are willing to pay, then that business can pay their employees more. But most people want to buy the best product at the best price.

It’s critically important. Often, I can say with experience, that connection either isn’t made or it’s not strong enough.

Human trafficking is a devastating crime that violates survivors’ most basic human rights. It is a brutal violation that exploits men, women and children. Today is an opportunity to not only condemn, but to shine a light on the severity and prevalence of human trafficking.", "Unfortunately, our province is a major centre for human trafficking. Of all of the cases reported to police across Canada, 65% come from Ontario. Human Trafficking Awareness Day is an opportunity to highlight this crime and encourage us all to speak up and speak out against it. We know that human traffickers are preying on the most vulnerable in our society. They control, abuse and exploit others for financial gain. Survivors of human trafficking experience serious and long-term trauma.", "As Minister of the Status of Women, Ontario’s first stand-alone ministry dedicated to the security and empowerment of women, I can say that tackling this horrific crime is a priority. That’s why, two years ago, our government launched Ontario’s Strategy to End Human Trafficking, which includes an investment of up to $72 million. The survivor-centred approach aims to prevent human trafficking by raising awareness and by holding traffickers accountable. Most importantly, this strategy ensures that the survivors have the supports and services they need to heal and rebuild their lives.", "That is why, last April, our government invited front-line service providers and indigenous partners to submit applications to the new community supports fund and the indigenous-led initiatives fund.

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to rise today and thank the minister for her comments. Today is February 22, which is the inaugural Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the province of Ontario. We on the PC caucus side of the Legislature have been fighting for this day for over two years, so thank heavens it’s here.", "As you know, I speak about this issue daily to raise awareness about human sex trafficking. I’ve travelled across this province; I’ve spoken to many survivors who have been instrumental in training the police on what to look for. They’ve trained police; they’ve trained victim services. So today, when I heard Casandra Diamond speak at lunch about the need for this day to occur—and she is a survivor and now an advocate and a person who actually goes and rescues victims of human sex trafficking in order to make them survivors. I say to the government: This has been a long time coming. We’re very happy it’s here. There’s so, so much more to be done.", "As the police and the victims service organizations and survivors have said for years, we need help. We need coordination. We, in this province of Ontario, as we found out in the select committee, are a hub for human sex trafficking. Sixty per cent of all the cases in Canada occur in Ontario. You have the police now saying that 60% of the victims they see are under 16. This is modern-day slavery. This is child abuse. This is an offence on everyone’s human rights to the worst level you’ve ever seen. It’s growing rapidly, and not for good reasons.", "The government announced today its hotline. I’m not using this as a prop, Madam Speaker, but I want to see those posters in every public washroom, in every airport and in every hotel and motel because it is about public awareness. That is the only way that we can get everyone in the province of Ontario to help us combat this horrendous crime.", "I spoke today about elementary principals telling me that they see texts on an 11-year-old’s or 12-year-old’s phone that say, “Come and be a model. We can get you into modelling.” That’s called luring, and those children will be gone, possibly in 24 hours, into a life of exploitation which they won’t be able to escape, unless we have this coordinated effort.", "We need more police who are trained, and more police to have resources. They want to help. They need the resources to get the officers trained and the resources to allow victim services. Giving resources to victim services—the government can speak to the dollars they’ve allotted to victim services, but it’s not enough. It’s a patchwork still. More and more needs to be done.", "I speak to Bill 96, which was the Saving the Girl Next Door Act, which I introduced a couple of times in the Legislature, which has finally come through. We still have not seen all of that bill implemented. We still have not seen the tort come in so that the victims can sue the trafficker. We still have not seen the tools and protection orders given to the police so that they can help rescue these vulnerable 14-, 15- and 16-year-olds. At any age, they can use the protection order.", "My friend Timea Nagy is a survivor and advocate, and she’s a tireless fighter in anti-human trafficking. She put it best when she said, “When all sectors come together and work in collaboration, we will eradicate this crime indefinitely.”", "I say to the government that you’ve made baby steps. We need to have more, and collectively we have to have more. If we cannot protect our children—I tell you those statistics of the average age being 14, over 93% Canadian-born. It’s happening across every corner of the province of Ontario, and the story is the same. Please help us coordinate with police, victim services and the justice system. We all have to be in this together. If we don’t, we are not going to save our children, and that is a priority for any government. I say that more needs to be done.", "I thank the government for the inaugural Human Trafficking Awareness Day, but there’s much, much more that needs to be done." ],

We talk about being safe online, but we need to realize that online or offline, the dangers are as real and dark as any of us would hate to imagine. Women and girls are seen as prey, and are bought, sold, raped and trafficked every day.", "Predators, pimps and gangs use our 401 corridor to traffic and travel constantly. Predators from other provinces come here because it’s so easy to traffic in Ontario. We haven’t caught on or caught up with what’s going on. Our courts haven’t figured it out, and are tremendously adversarial. We don’t focus in on trucking trafficking, and we aren’t funding necessary initiatives to combat the game or support survivors. We need to have a hotel and motel strategy. Are we training the service industry to know what to look for in their places of business and know how to safely intervene or report?", "Human trafficking is everywhere. Predatory gangs and groups target young girls. They will prey on the vulnerable, which can mean the young, the isolated, the addicted or the lonely—anyone they can manipulate and separate from support. It happens everywhere. Young, outgoing, friendly pimps work the local malls and schoolyards to groom and manipulate girls. They layer the manipulation and attention until they can eventually maneuver a girl into a situation where they take her over and profit from the horrible things some horrible men will always pay for.", "If she is trafficked, we need to recognize it and help her. If she is stolen, we need to find her and bring her home. If we can pull her out of the system, we have to support her and help her to recover so she may one day somehow find a pathway out of the trauma. But for most of the women and kids trafficked in the shadows, there may never be help.", "Every community needs to understand that trafficking isn’t about someone else’s community. This isn’t something that happens in a lower socio-economic setting. It isn’t just in the GTA. Yes, it happens in Durham. It happens up north. It happens especially in our border towns, and everywhere that connects them.", "Some girls are raped as early as 5 o’clock in the morning, pimped to men who have breakfast with their families and then stop into a hotel on the way to work. Our police are seeing an increase in cases. They are making connections to missing children and trying to identify networks of gangs and pimps and understand the complexities of it.", "In Durham, we have the Durham Region Human Trafficking Coalition, comprised of over 30 coalition groups, including police, victim services and support organizations. It is a very successful coalition where the focus is to support the victims and survivors in the community. Larry Shanks is chair of the coalition and is proud that SafeHope Home has recently been funded and opened.", "SafeHope Home is long-term recovery housing for survivors of sex trafficking. It’s the first and only of its kind in the province, and I am so grateful that it exists. However, the needs far exceed the supports available across the province. I hope that all communities will be able to have a safe home for survivors. Many women who have been trafficked are not able to find safe housing, and they die homeless. This is not acceptable in Canada. Other support organizations have applied for provincial government funding to combat or deal with the scourge of human trafficking and, sadly, I know of a few locally that have been rejected. I applaud the unbelievably meaningful work done by our community organizations, and we all need to thank them.", "Speaker, there is only one group that can stop traffickers and get our girls out of the web, and that is our police. In Durham, our human trafficking unit works tirelessly to combat human trafficking. They’ve done unimaginable work, and we cannot thank them enough. To the officers across the province, our municipal police as well as our OPP, thank you for doing the work that we cannot even imagine.", "I’ve invited myself on a police ride-along to better understand. So, what about the rest of you? What is happening behind the scenes in your communities? Do you even want to know? Our police know, and they’re working every day to make it safer. They are supporting victims as they go through the excruciating preliminary court process, where they have to defend themselves to an experienced attorney as they relive memories of rape and violence and trauma. Police are trying to find and save girls all the time with limited resources and a moving target. In Durham, our police work with a grant to educate our girls in high school. They help girls recognize the signs of grooming and help them protect themselves and others from the dangers of trafficking. This education is invaluable to prevent girls from getting recruited or developing false relationships with predators. But girls in grade 9 who get the education in gym class: By that age, they’re already being identified as victims of human trafficking.", "Parents, what are you doing to keep your kids safe? Learn how to protect them and get more involved in their lives online and offline. Know your kids and their friends and watch for signs of unhealthy relationships.", "Today was the first Human Trafficking Awareness Day, but every day the awful scourge of human trafficking flourishes in this province. Thank you to our police and our partners who are doing the work to solve and save and support.", "This is everywhere, in every community, and so we need to understand it and end it.", "To our girls who are being exploited: You are loved.

Engineers utilize the pure sciences and turn them into practical, everyday products and services, such as cars, jet planes, cellphones, roads and bridges, and toasters, just to mention a few of the tens of thousands of products that they are responsible for the production of.", "In addition to the many products engineers design and build, they are natural problem solvers. Their training at university and in the real world revolves around problem solving: the art of breaking down a problem into its component parts and providing a solution. Our professors spent long hours highlighting the need and the method of creating diagrams to illustrate the forces that act on an object.", "Companies have learned as well that engineers would also make great CEOs, policy-makers, entrepreneurs and researchers. I once heard a guest speaker speak to this very issue, and that engineers should be more involved in politics and would actually make great politicians.", "The world has become very complex, and governments are required to make decisions on technology that will greatly impact our standard of living and our ability to compete in this very competitive world.", "I can highlight this with no better example than that of the Liberal government’s Green Energy Act. In 2011, the association of professional engineers issued a report in their quarterly publication highlighting the problems with this act: how it did not consider the design of the grid and that it would not achieve the desired outcomes, possibly even causing the grid to fail.", "Of course, the rest is history, as the Green Energy Act drove up the cost of electricity to a point where our manufacturers can no longer compete, forcing many of them to relocate to lower-cost jurisdictions. Our Auditor General also revealed that this government ignored reports from the engineers at the Ontario Energy Board that advised against many government policies. Just last fall, another report issued by the engineering association calculated the cost of the so-called green energy wasted in 2016 alone to be worth well over $1 billion.", "This just highlights some of the problems and hardships that can arise when governments ignore the basic laws of physics for political gain.", "It’s unfortunate today that so many of those whom this bill calls the “drivers of wealth and job creation, innovation, and productivity” are actually unemployed. When I graduated, our universities could not produce enough engineers to fill demand. Sadly, today, many of our graduating engineers in Ontario are either unemployed or underemployed.", "We need to again get back to basing our government policy on practical science and make the tough decisions necessary to put our province back where it belongs, as the economic engine of Canada, and move it away from the have-not status that this government has put us into today." ],

It takes years of university education, four additional years of acceptable engineering experience and the successful completion of a professional practice examination administered by Professional Engineers Ontario.", "Ontario is home to more than 85,000 professional engineers, highly skilled professionals who are the drivers of wealth and job creation, innovation and productivity in each of our province’s most strategic sectors. Ontario’s professional engineers have world-class education, skills and ethical standards that empower them as problem solvers, preventing harm, finding solutions, and creating wealth, value and jobs across our province.", "Honestly, Speaker, what are we going to debate here today? We all agree that we need and we should look at promoting even more of our engineers. From my perspective, March 1 is just the simple thing that we can do. We need to recognize the great work that our engineers are doing each and every other day. Such a day could help the public understand how professional engineers contribute to society. Their important contribution helps us all in many different ways, every single day. They are an essential part of our economy and our society.", "Taking the time once a year to understand and appreciate the work engineers do is a very easy gesture that we can all absolutely do. It is easy to forget how we depend on them to make sure we can continue to live our lives safely every day and how we depend on them each and every day, each and every year.", "Engineers come in many different shapes and forms. In my role as critic for northern development and mines, I get to see and experience the work engineers do in a very different context. To me, it is just as incredible to see engineers work on skyscrapers as it is to see them working in mines. We need them in every corner of the province for things you don’t even know you need them for yet. They create solutions, not just fixes.", "Yes, we should take a day to recognize the commitment they have made with their career to solve almost impossible problems and develop technical solutions for future engineers that will continue to create and solve issues that will benefit all of our lives. Engineers are key in the development of our societies by making them simpler, safer and better.", "If we want to see Ontario grow and prosper and stay ahead, it is crucial that we support engineers. More than ever, engineering is a domain that will shape our future. That is why it’s important to train the best engineers here in Ontario.", "The world is changing rapidly, and we need to train and support professional engineers to help us through these transitions. We need smart, creative and willing people to solve the problems of tomorrow and have our province come out on top and lead.", "I hope everyone in this chamber will agree that we need to invest more in higher education as well. If we actually want to continue growing in a sustainable way, we need more problem solvers; we need more engineers.", "Just like in the mining sector, I know the industry has been reinventing itself, thanks in large part to engineers who make it possible. I know the Ring of Fire represents in many ways a very interesting engineering challenge. As you all know, it represents an enormous potential for northern Ontario but also this whole province. And just like in many other major projects, engineers are always there, from the planning through to the problems that arise, that they talk about, and actually, they’re there until it gets done.", "The same goes for many other industries. We need to make things more affordable but safer. We need to make things go faster and bigger, but with minimal impact to the environment.", "Our challenges have changed and the profession of engineering has evolved. Challenges are arising from everywhere, especially in northern Ontario. We need to find sustainable, affordable, reliable energy sources that can solve the energy crisis past governments have created and that affects the north immensely more than anywhere else. We need to find new ways to develop northern Ontario and all of its communities, while making sure we fix our aging infrastructure and mitigate our environmental impacts.", "All of these things require more problem solvers—more engineers. It starts not only with recognizing the important contribution professional engineers have given to this province, but with the province investing in the incredible potential professional engineers can offer to all of us.", "It’s with great pride that I offer my support to this motion, long overdue—a profession that you can hold yourself with pride." ],

The same can be said of engineers working in cities across our province, Canada and the world.", "Like many little girls, I wanted nothing more than to be an engineer when I was growing up. The reason why I wanted to be an engineer was because I wanted to build bridges. How ironic that today I made a statement on the bridge announcement in Kingston and the Islands, and yesterday we got federal funding announced by our MP, Mark Gerretsen, so we now have what we need to build that bridge. We will be working with many engineers in the province.", "The special work being done by engineers largely takes place behind the scenes and away from the public eye. Yet the safety of so many individuals in our communities across this province depends on their diligence and hard work. This is an important motion because so often we just don’t think about the work that engineers do because we depend on living in safe societies and communities. They do their jobs so well that we very rarely have an occasion to question or worry about engineering that stands beneath us and around us, that we work with in our daily lives.", "Every week, I take the train from Toronto to my riding of Kingston and the Islands, and I wonder if people ever stop and think about the weight of all the people on the train, the strength of the steel, the engineering that goes into welding the joints, the thickness of the metal, and the velocity of the train. There are calculations for that. The same goes for planes, of course, except with planes, there are humans that are airborne.", "Do you ever wonder about the buildings that you walk past on a daily basis? In Toronto’s downtown core, there are many new buildings being built and undergoing renovations. In the latter case, they are being gutted entirely, like the building across from where my office is, the Sutton Place Hotel. Girders are being removed. Walls have been coming down for years now. You can actually see excavators and front-end loaders on those floors, working to replace that building.", "There are literally thousands and thousands of important decisions that go into these projects. There are decisions that are critical and precise, and they require data that engineers work with on a daily basis. Engineers don’t just wonder about such things; they live and they breathe those formulas and that data every single day.", "Recognizing March 1 as Ontario engineers’ day will serve as a reminder of all of the work that engineers do in our province to keep our citizens moving. It will support them—supports the citizens in our daily lives at work and at home, and it will keep each and every one of us safe.", "On a societal level, engineers are critical to innovation and our economic prosperity, which has already been mentioned.", "Whenever I have the opportunity, I always take time to visit Kingston’s Innovation Park. I’m always amazed to see engineers from all backgrounds coming together and working in teams to solve some of our most prevalent issues in society. These issues range from health care and the environment to infrastructure, to name just a few. It’s important that we recognize the important work, which is the culmination of passion, hard work and often multidisciplinary teamwork that exists between engineers and other industry professionals.", "Recognizing March 1 will signal our continued support of engineers across this province and their unique place in helping each and every community thrive.", "Ontario is home to some of the most prestigious engineering schools in the world, and of course Queen’s University is one of them. I’m very excited, and I cannot wait to see what future technologies, products and innovations our future students at Queen’s University will be bringing forward in the years to come.", "With that, I would like to thank MPP Granville Anderson and his team for bringing this important legislation forward.

I was joined by the member for Ajax and the member for Durham at the awards ceremony.", "Ontario professional engineers are well educated, and prepared to apply the best up-to-date technology in an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective way. They’re also responsible for safeguarding life, health and public welfare. In my riding of Whitby–Oshawa, you don’t need to look very far to see examples of their contributions.", "They are a regulatory body: In the same way as the College of Physicians and Surgeons regulates the medical profession, or how the Law Society of Upper Canada sets standards for lawyers, Professional Engineers Ontario fulfills the same important role for engineers. In so doing, Professional Engineers Ontario grants licences to engineers and sets standards for the practice of engineering in Ontario.", "On January 27 of this year, it was my honour to attend the Professional Engineers Ontario, Lake Ontario chapter, annual general meeting and licence presentation, which recognized this year’s new professional engineer licensees, who work day in and day out in the region of Durham to help keep the public safe. In achieving this designation, these licensees were required to demonstrate four years of engineering work experience, at least one of which must have been completed in a Canadian jurisdiction. They were also evaluated by Professional Engineers Ontario on five quality-based criteria, including the application of theory, practical experience, management of engineering, communication skills, and awareness of the social implications of engineering.", "I hope all the members of the Legislature will join me in congratulating this year’s recipients from the region of Durham. They are Bailie Christina Paplinskie, Michael Matthew Halverson, Tsz Kin Mui, Isabel Christina De Siquera Victal and Faisal Hasan Khan. It’s my sincere hope that their achievements will inspire others, particularly young students, to pursue a career in engineering, especially as Ontario faces a growing skills mismatch.", "In my role as the official opposition critic, I’ve had the opportunity to visit a number of universities and community colleges, and a common theme I’ve heard is that we as a province need to do a better job of graduating students for the jobs of today and tomorrow, not the jobs of yesterday.", "One concrete way that we can alleviate the growing skills mismatch is by improving the coordination between the private sector, educational institutions and government when it comes to sharing labour market information with students. Better labour market information is vital to help students determine which jobs will be in demand or what they pay, so they can consider these fields; for example, engineering. Ontario’s job information portal should be more accessible, user-friendly and informative, so that it does a better job of linking students with in-demand careers.", "Speaker, I would echo again my congratulations to the new professional engineer licensees under the Lake Ontario chapter of Professional Engineers Ontario.

They’ve had a Professional Engineers Day in the United States for a couple of years now—almost two years. The first was celebrated on August 3 in 2016. The idea in the States was the brainchild of a man by the name of Tim Austin. He’s a professional engineer in Kansas and he came up with the concept while serving as president of the National Society of Professional Engineers for the term 2015-16.", "That society has a core principle that its members are proud of. It reads, “Being a licensed professional engineer means more than just holding a certificate and possessing technical competence. It is a commitment to hold the public health, safety, and welfare above all other considerations.”", "In the United States, professional engineers have been licensed for more than 110 years, dating back to 1907. Now they celebrate on the first Wednesday in August. Here in Ontario the day would be celebrated on March 1, at the start of National Engineering Week, of which we’ve heard. We have something like 85,000 men and women with an iron ring on their pinky finger, designating them as engineers.", "Ontario’s professional engineers have been around for nearly 100 years and, Speaker, engineers do some pretty amazing things. We don’t recognize their achievements as well as we should.", "It’s a simple thing these days just to go on the Internet and look for some of the cool things engineers are known for. They design roller coasters, skyscrapers, cars, towers, bridges, tunnels. You can’t get into outer space without an engineer having something to do with the idea. If you go to the movies—go see Black Panther—engineers came up with all of those special effects. What would our kids and grandkids do without new toys—toys designed by engineers, and playground equipment designed and created by engineers?", "These folks use their knowledge of chemistry to combine different elements in various combinations to create new foods and find ways to store food and keep it safe. We’ve talked in this House this week about Rowan’s Law. Well, engineers are working on new designs for football and hockey helmets, let alone that they come up with new technologies and tools for surgeons, and better equipment for hospitals. They create artificial body parts and limbs, and they look for ways to protect the environment from pollution.", "Of course, as we all heard here in the House last fall, the member from Kitchener–Waterloo, Ms. Fife, told us that the Wynne Liberals have muzzled their ministry engineers concerned about the health of families living in Chemical Valley, near Sarnia. The member accused the government of listening to industry lobbyists instead of ministry experts. The professional engineers working for the government of Ontario let it be known that they’ve been warning the Liberals for years about the negative impacts of air pollution on the Aamjiwnaang First Nation near Sarnia. Poorly regulated flaring of acid gas is emitting unsafe levels of sulphur dioxide. These engineers were ordered not to say anything, which is against their code of ethics.", "Speaker, I have great faith in our professional engineers. I’ll mention a couple of them from my area. Hilary Payne, a former city administrator in Windsor, is now a city councillor; he’s been there for a number of years, a number of terms. Andrew Dowie works for the city but he’s an elected town councillor in Tecumseh. My former next-door neighbour David Holland took his engineering degree to the Royal Canadian Air Force, flies our latest fighter jets and trains new pilots on them as well. The leader of our local society of professional engineers is Asif Khan, who works for the Fiat Chrysler automotive group. The society engages young people by holding annual competitions for young people, events such as building bridges out of Popsicle sticks. It’s great training for budding future engineers.", "Engineers do it all, Speaker. I know you’ve been watching a lot of the Olympics on TV, as I have. I am suffering sleep deprivation today after the hockey game last night. Engineers invented the snowboard. They perfected modern running shoes. I know you enjoy the Ferris wheel. It’s one of the most interesting engineering wonders of the world, and it was created by an engineer named Ferris way back in 1893.", "You want a better TV? Well, talk to an engineer.", "They can even tell you how badly the Liberals have messed up the energy file in Ontario. Just yesterday, in this House, the member from Prince Edward–Hastings, Mr. Smith, spoke about a report from the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers. He was speaking of the money lost when the Liberals sold hydro we didn’t need to competitors outside of Ontario’s borders. We pay a good price to generate electricity, but we overproduce and sell the excess power at a reduced rate. Mr. Smith—and he’s here to tell you if I’m not speaking the truth—says the report from the engineers puts that loss to Ontario taxpayers at somewhere between $732 million and one and a quarter billion dollars. The engineers say, “Don’t sell it across the border; make it available to our own residents and manufacturers.”", "Speaker, professional engineers call it as they see it.

I heard, loud and clear, that they asked for more students in the STEM disciplines to come out of our post-secondary institutions. That’s why I’m very pleased that in the last fall economic statement the finance minister announced that Ontario will be producing 25% more post-secondary students in the STEM disciplines.

He is on my executive and helps out in Thornhill with our association. He helps out as well down here at Queen’s Park. Last week we were actually touring the University of Waterloo, which is my alma mater. I went to optometry school there. Optometrists actually like to think of themselves as health science engineers, whether the engineers see us as that or not, because so much of what we study is optics and things like that, which I think are closely related to the field of engineering.", "We toured the Waterloo Institute for Quantum Computing. It was very interesting. I think we understood a small amount of what they were trying to teach us, but we got the idea that it’s hard for us to envision the world of the future, and I think that’s what we count on our engineers being able to do. They know what’s coming in 10, 20 and 30 years, before the rest of us quite catch on. We have to see the Internet to really believe it. But I think they’re going to anticipate a lot of things, like autonomous driving cars and things like that in the future. We need them.

The Affordable Electricity Act will do that by making electricity prices as low as they can be by bringing as quick an end as possible to the government-imposed policies and programs that have added several billions of dollars every year to the electricity bills of the citizens of Ontario.", "This bill requires the government to put the interests of electricity consumers first. It puts priority on generating electricity from the inexpensive, reliable and cost-effective hydro and nuclear power plants that the public already owns. It brings an end to policies, programs and contracts that force consumers to subsidize foreign-sourced electrical technologies that are unreliable and ridiculously expensive. It demands full transparency and the process by which electricity prices are set. It allows customers to buy electricity from suppliers who sell it at the lowest price. It lets customers buy electricity when the price is the lowest, and always at the lowest price that Ontario’s electricity is being sold to customers in other provinces or in the USA.", "This bill is needed because the current electricity policies have raised prices to the point where a growing number of Ontario’s families are being forced to choose between paying their electricity bill or buying their food. Many businesses have been forced to close, and many of the remaining businesses feel that they can survive only if they move away from Ontario.", "The current course spells disaster for Ontario. Things must change, but they will only change if this Legislature puts the interest of citizens first.", "We can no longer allow political ideologies, backroom games and clever political and bureaucratic deals to displace sound planning and management of the electrical system. We must put electricity planning and pricing on a solid footing. We must put a stop to the wild ideological gambles and the hopeful technological adventurism that has caused so much harm. We must bring an end to the hidden arrangements, the deferred payments and the clever political spin. We must ensure that families and businesses in Ontario have access to electricity at an affordable price. If we don’t, more families will suffer, more businesses will close, and our economy will not be able to pay for the important common services that we all need.", "Madam Speaker, the current problems with electricity pricing were recognized by this Legislature more than a decade ago. In 2004, this Legislature passed a bill to avoid the growing problem. That bill required the preparation and approval of a detailed plan for electricity production, distribution and sale in Ontario to protect the interests of consumers and to put electricity planning on a solid footing for the future.", "The Auditor General referred to that bill in her 2015 report on electricity power system planning. Most importantly, she noted that the government had done nothing to comply with the statutory requirements.", "In her follow-up report of 2017, the Auditor General said, “The Electricity Act ... was amended in 2004 to require the Ontario Power Authority ... to ... prepare a detailed technical plan and submit it ... for review and approval to ensure that it is prudent and cost-effective.", "“However,” she said, “as of our 2015 audit, no such plan had ever been approved in the previous 10 years as required by the legislation to protect consumers’ interests.”", "Instead of complying with that law, the government embarked upon a series of policies that put ideological beliefs and partisan interests ahead of the duty to protect the interests of consumers. As a result, electricity users in Ontario have been burdened with billions of dollars of unnecessary costs on their electricity bills every year, costs that would not have been imposed if the government had complied with the law.", "Electricity consumers are being forced to pay huge subsidies to domestic and foreign firms to build and operate unreliable solar and wind energy plants; to pay absurdly high prices for electricity produced by renewable electricity facilities; to curtail a significant portion of the production from publicly owned hydro and nuclear generating plants that were already producing cheap, reliable power; to pay electricity producers so that they would stop producing electricity; to buy electricity that we do not need; and to subsidize customers in the United States by selling that surplus power to them for far less than we are forced to buy it.", "Madam Speaker, this Legislature did nothing when the government decided to ignore the law that was passed in 2004. It did nothing to stop government pursuing destructive policies that undermine those legal requirements by imposing programs that add billions of dollars to current and future electricity bills, and by forcing electricity customers to pay at least $1.3 billion to plan, build and then abandon two gas-powered electricity plants that were thrust on communities that did not want them.", "The Legislature took no effective action, even when the Premier confirmed that that decision constituted a breach of trust between government and the people of Ontario, and that the public good was sacrificed to partisan interests.", "In short, this Legislature allowed political ideologies, clever deception—", "Interjections." ],

I don’t know if I want to respond first to the member’s bill or the comments that were just made by the member on the government side. However, I can confirm one thing, and that is that the member who proposes this bill is absolutely right: The government has made a terrible mess of our electricity system. They have actually mangled the way we deliver electricity in the province of Ontario, and it’s completely wrong.", "I appreciate the fact that the member has put forward this bill. The spirit of the bill is right on. However, the practicality of some of the things that he’s proposing isn’t going to work. We’ll get into a little bit of that.", "When I became the energy critic a little over a year ago now, we started developing our energy policy. I spent close to eight months during that policy advisory process in our committee and meeting with stakeholders, as well, as part of my job as the energy critic.", "The member was a little bit late in introducing his bill, so we haven’t had an opportunity to take a really close look at it, but we can discuss this in broad strokes. In the broad strokes, I would say that this is an admirable aim, but there is a little bit of shortcoming here on practical application.", "Typically, when duties are imposed on the minister, as they were in British Columbia back in the Gordon Campbell government, the minister faces some kind of pain or penalty if the duty isn’t lived up to. In other provinces where ministers have such duties imposed on them, duties are usually given specific annual targets and, year over year, they’re required to meet those targets. I remember when the former Mike Harris government here had their Red Tape Commission. I know the member knows that well. There were specific targets that were set out for that committee to meet every year. If they didn’t meet those, there were certain penalties attached to it as well.", "The bill that we’re debating here today only has one target date and that’s December 31 of this year. On the measures it recommends, it offers no specific, actionable set of targets for each of the policy measures that are mentioned in the bill. It could be for this reason that it offers no penalty on the minister should they fail to meet these targets.", "The member opposite on the government side was talking about the fact that they’ve done a lot of this work already and they’ve come up with a solution for this problem, but clearly that’s a bogus response to what the member has presented here today as a solution to this problem as well. The member opposite on the government side has said they’ve come up with a solution to lower the cost of producing electricity, but they haven’t done anything of that type.", "It’s difficult for me to assess on the surface what the actual purpose of this legislation is if it’s not going to work when it’s implemented. If it were to pass in its current form, it would provide no reasonable recourse for either the public or the members of this House to force the minister to do anything differently than they’re doing now. For that reason, there is an apparent flaw in the structure of the bill.", "Now, as to the substance of the bill itself and the measures that it recommends, it is an interesting piece of law. Large sections of it seem to have been lifted from the PC platform, or I believe maybe they used the PC platform as a starting point, but it did take a bit of a wild turn, especially when it comes to the Liberals’ unfair hydro plan.", "We’re all, for example, in favour of greater transparency. I know I wrote this down as the member was speaking, that we need to get back to transparency, and I agree with him 100%, because the Liberals have not been transparent on the electricity file and on the energy file for a long, long time, as the member pointed out—all the way back to 2004. But at least on this side of the House—I can speak for all of the members on this side of the House—we talk about transparency all the time, and the Liberals have not lived up to that transparent level of government that we provide on this bill. The sections of this bill which deal with transparency don’t really offer any practical solutions for how we can improve that. What are offered are either platitudes or already existing processes.", "Some of the other provisions would actually violate existing power purchase agreements, leaving the province open to lawsuits unless you legislatively terminate those contracts, but that option isn’t mentioned in this legislation.", "Changing the Independent Electricity System Operator’s, the IESO’s, dispatch order for technologies is fine. The member talked about, “Why are we wasting our low-cost nuclear power and why are we wasting our low-cost and renewable hydroelectric power in favour of solar and wind, which are much more expensive?” He’s absolutely correct on that. This government has completely botched this process.", "We just spent some time talking about the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, or at least the member from Windsor–Tecumseh just did when he was talking about the bill that we were just speaking of, declaring an engineers’ day in Ontario. The Liberals have made a terrible mess when it comes to dispatching the electricity and the energy that we’re using here in Ontario. So we can take steps to do that.", "Speaker, I would also agree with the member when he talks about backroom deals. It goes back to that lack of transparency, but clearly what we’ve seen here in Ontario are these backroom deals that have been made, and we have followed the money. We have followed the money, and those who made considerable contributions to the Liberal Party have benefited when it comes to the awarding of these contracts. That is wrong, and it’s shamefully wrong.", "Madam Speaker, I just want to go back to one last thing before I close off—I know there are a couple of members who want to speak, on our side, to this bill. The member from Northumberland–Quinte West talked about the fact that the government has come up with a solution to the mess that they’ve made here in Ontario, but clearly they haven’t fixed the underlying problem. I think the member from Carleton–Mississippi Mills tries to address that issue as well. What they have done is set out to borrow billions and billions of dollars just to get the Liberals through the next election period, which is just around the corner. In turn, they’ll be saddling the next generation with the 10 years of mistakes that they have made on the energy file. They will be paid off by electricity customers over the next 30 years.", "They haven’t fixed a thing, but they’ve set out to borrow billions and billions of dollars. As the Financial Accountability Officer has said, it could be as much as $93 billion or $94 billion at the end of this scheme, just to make it appear as if they’re lowering electricity rates in the province of Ontario. It’s absolutely shameful. It doesn’t fix a thing. It just creates the appearance that electricity bills are a bit lower for the next couple of years. But we know, because of a leaked cabinet document that was sent to my office and reports from the Auditor General and the Financial Accountability Officer, that after the next election, the electricity rates will start to skyrocket again to record highs. So they haven’t fixed a thing.", "I know the member has tried to put forward a piece of legislation that will address the problem. There are some shortcomings. If it ever makes it to committee, we will have to take a little bit of a scalpel to it and make sure we do some surgery on it, but the spirit of the bill is a good one." ],

Any time that we get a chance to discuss the electricity system in Ontario, it’s time well spent in this Legislature—and I’d like to thank the member for that—because specifically in rural Ontario, electricity is a huge cost. It is driving people out of rural Ontario.", "I listened intently to the member, I listened intently to the member of the government and I listened intently to the energy critic from the PCs. One measure in here that we very strongly agree with: “prohibit any measure that results in electricity prices being artificially lowered by borrowing money today that must be paid back in the future.” That is against the Liberals’ fair hydro plan.", "When the member across said that the Liberals were fixing the hydro system and the costs, basically what they’re doing is borrowing millions and millions and millions of dollars to artificially lower the price—it’s like the minimum payment on a credit card—to make it past the election, and then the bill is going to come due with interest on top. And electricity rates are going to skyrocket.", "The interesting part is when the PC energy critic said that the member from Carleton–Mississippi Mills had lifted much of this from the PC energy platform. The interesting thing about the PC energy platform, or at least the PC platform for today, is that it’s going to keep the Liberal fair hydro plan as part of their platform. So the millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars the PCs are accusing the government of using to buy voters for the next election—the PCs with the current People’s Guarantee are going to do exactly the same thing. It’s like both pots calling both kettles black.", "Quite frankly, that is not the way to fix the problem. It fixes the political problem for the next election, because I know in my constituency office and, I’m sure, many others, the number of complaints that people can’t pay their hydro bills—specifically, where I come from, it’s very cold in the wintertime and a lot of people heat with hydro—has gone down because, yes, the bills have gone down, temporarily.", "The vast majority of people in this province, tragically, live paycheque to paycheque. If they see a temporary reprieve, they’re just happy they can make it to the next month. But the government knows, and the Progressive Conservatives know, that in the long term this isn’t going to fix the problem. They’re just delaying the balloon payment, they’re delaying the fire. So that’s one where I was quite surprised when the PC critic brought it up. He focused on the fair hydro plan; we would stop the fair hydro plan. There are other ways to fix this problem, and some of them are in this bill.", "We believe in public power. We would focus on public power. We believe that our public utilities should be used to their utmost. We also believe that transmission should be returned to public hands so that you can actually use the ownership of your transmission system for the benefit of your people.", "The Ontario Liberals chose to sell 60% of Hydro One. They chose to sell it for a big cheque, for a short-term cheque. They say it’s to repurpose the money for transit. We say it’s to balance the budget for, once again, political purposes. But by selling 60% of Hydro One, they have foregone huge dividends. Those dividends are now going to the private sector.", "So, they got one cheque, but long-term they’re costing Ontarians money. And that’s not just the NDP saying it; that’s the Financial Accountability Officer. By selling Hydro One, they’re actually going to cost Ontarians $1.8 billion more than if they had kept Hydro One and borrowed the money for their transportation infrastructure. They waste billions of dollars. We’ll take those dividends that we still have, the 40%, and we’ll use those dividends to slowly buy back control of Hydro One.", "They tell you that, “Oh, no, we still have control, because we are the biggest shareholder. That maintains our control, and there are safeguards in place.” Well, if that is the case, and the Ontario government maintains control in the purpose of Hydro One and the Ontario government is opposed and we are opposed as well to the use of coal for hydro generation, then why is Hydro One investing in coal generation in the United States? Does that benefit anyone in Ontario? And does that benefit the climate? No. That’s the reason why we moved—and, I believe, all three major parties agreed to move—away from coal. We shouldn’t be investing in coal generation in other counties. If we actually had control of Hydro One, we wouldn’t be, so we need to regain control of Hydro One.", "Some of the issues where we have some trepidation with this bill—I regret that the member didn’t actually spend a lot of time talking about what’s in the bill. He talked about his political views, and that’s his right. We all talk about our political views. But there are some things he didn’t mention in the bill. The bill is totally focused on the lowest price for power for the consumer, and I agree with that to a point, but to only focus on that, you are giving up other things. When you always go to the lowest common denominator, you could potentially be giving up reliability.", "I know from my business—I’m a farmer by trade—that when I hired custom workers, the one who was always the cheapest didn’t necessarily get the job done on time. With hydro, because it’s an essential service, we have to make sure that it’s not just as cheap as possible, but that it’s reliable, because one of the things that precipitated the hydro crisis was that under the Conservative government, they didn’t spend on the system. We had a brownout, and whether it was caused by that or not, that led the next government to spend a lot of money on the hydro system.", "We’ve got to make sure that we don’t go to the lowest common denominator and that we make sure that everyone is provided service, because one of the things we face in rural Ontario is that in some places in rural Ontario—and that’s why we fight so hard to keep Hydro One—it doesn’t pay a private company to deliver hydro at the end of the road. I come from the end of the road. I don’t want that to happen. This bill doesn’t guarantee that, and that is a huge issue.", "That’s one of the reasons that we so strongly believe that essential services should be delivered publicly. The private sector has got a huge role to play in the province. We’re not anti-private sector at all—they have a huge role to play—but essential services shouldn’t be profit-driven. How I know that is because the Internet is profit-driven, and in how many places in rural Ontario is broadband Internet either unaffordable, unavailable or unusable? That’s because it’s profit-driven. Hydro is an essential service. It can’t be profit driven. That’s why we want to pull that back.", "We agree that where there is private hydro generation, where it’s too expensive, when their contracts run out, they should be lapsed. You can’t just cancel contracts because you’ll—that’s the gas plant scandal. That’s what happened with the gas plant scandal. They tried to cancel a contract, could have gotten sued and had to pay a bunch of money. You can’t do that.", "But we agree with the sentiment of the bill, that the primary focus of the hydro system has to be consumer-driven. Where the government has consistently gotten into trouble is that they never look at the unintended consequences. They look at the political answer. That’s the fair hydro plan: Provide a political short-term answer, and the unintended consequences are going to be huge.", "The Green Energy Act: Green energy isn’t a bad thing, but they created the Green Energy Act—" ],

Now, on that point, I very much agree with it.", "He also said that “large sections of it seem to have been lifted from the PC platform,” which is yet another reason to say to folks out there: “buyer beware.” We’ve seen what happens when the Conservatives run electricity in the past. It didn’t work then and it’s not going to work now or in the future.", "Let’s just go through this bill, take it piece by piece and examine what it’s proposing and look at some of the problems with it. It asks that water-powered and nuclear-powered generating stations be used to their maximum advantage. Well, our water power and our nuclear generating stations are all managed by Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power. As of noon today, the demand in Ontario was 17,260 megawatts of electricity. Nuclear was supplying 10,600 of that; hydro was supplying 5,050 of that. Taken together, 91% of Ontario’s power was being supplied by hydro and nuclear. So he’s asking for something that’s already happening.", "The bill asks that electricity be distributed through the distribution grid and supplied on the basis of competitive bids from all potential suppliers. Well, the Independent Electricity System Operator does exactly that.", "The bill asks for transparency in the electricity regulation process, and the Ontario Energy Board does exactly that.", "He goes on to talk about, and let me use the words exactly: “terminate all existing subsidies for wind and solar electricity generation projects at the earliest possible opportunity.” Well, that involves the abrogation of binding, long-term agreements with suppliers, which would cost the province billions and billions. By the way, most of the capacity coming on now is bidding very close to grid parity. So to talk about a premium in an age when the price of renewable electricity has been coming down and is very close to grid parity is just an exercise in sophistry.", "The bill continues on to say that it requires the grid “to be maintained in an efficient state to serve all customers.” Well, the Independent Electricity System Operator, Hydro One and our local distribution companies do exactly that, and in the last dozen years, the province has spent $15 billion upgrading the grid to do precisely that.", "It also asks that the costs for maintaining and operating the grid are “reduced to levels that are comparable with costs in the most cost-effective private operations.” In other words: cuts, cuts, cuts; stop investing; run it into the ground and do nothing. That’s what caused the problems in the first place.", "The bills asks that costs be required “to be open to public scrutiny.” Well, in the case of publicly traded entities such as Alectra and Hydro One, the Ontario Securities Commission does exactly that, and, for the balance, the Ontario Energy Board does precisely that.", "It talks about removing restrictions that limit the ability of a potential supplier of electricity to use the grid. Well, that’s called a capacity option, and we have that.", "We talk about prohibiting “any measure that results in electricity prices being artificially lowered by borrowing money today that must be paid back in the future.” Now, those words are lifted directly from the bill. In other words, what it does is say that you can’t invest in capital expenses. What it does is say that the $50 billion that Ontario has spent in updating generation and transmission over the last dozen years—if this bill were in force, you couldn’t do it, which is ludicrous.", "There’s a bunch of gobbledygook in here that asks that electricity bills itemize the portion of the bill that deals with the repayment of sunk costs and so on and so forth. This sort of nonsense is like asking a product manufacturer to itemize out R&D, product development and marketing on the price tag of a good on the shelf, which, if that sounds realistic, I challenge you to try doing that in the private sector.", "It talks little bit about electricity exports and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense in it. The reason that electricity is exported in the first place is that (1) Ontario doesn’t need it at that moment; and (2) the provinces and states to which we are connected at 26 intertie points—Quebec, Manitoba, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota—do need it at exactly that point in time. So to suggest that, somehow or other, Ontario consumers are being disadvantaged by taking surplus power that isn’t needed at a point in time in the province of Ontario while the power is available and selling it at a profit to Quebec, which is buying power from Ontario even as we speak—Quebec has a shortage of electricity in the wintertime and Quebec buys the equivalent of about 500 megawatts of power from Ontario throughout the winter. In turn, Ontario buys about 500 megawatts of power at the same price, under the same terms, from Quebec in the summer, when Ontario needs the power and Quebec doesn’t. That’s what neighbours do; they trade with one another in that way." ],

That’s probably the reason that this bill really isn’t going anywhere, regardless of how the Legislature chooses to dispose of it this afternoon: these—to be polite—totally unworkable and, quite frankly, ludicrous conditions that the bill proposes.", "Now, it also suggests “conducting a study to identify other ways to allow Ontario residents to benefit immediately for more efficient use of the electricity system” and “implementing regulatory and policy changes to ensure that customers benefit from reduced costs that result from more efficient use of the electricity system”—in other words, it says the same thing twice—but that’s called the long-term energy plan.

It has probably been the number one topic of interest to constituents across the province of Ontario.", "What the member did say that I really supported is that we should be putting the interests of the citizens of Ontario first. He’s absolutely correct that that’s what we should be doing and that we need to get back to transparency, which I support as well.", "I’m going to actually quote, because it’s so interesting that we’re discussing this right following declaring March 1 as a professional engineers of Ontario recognition day here in the province of Ontario.", "It’s so interesting that we’ve just had the debate for that motion in the House, because here I have in front of me the official blog of the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers. They call it Society Notes, if anybody is interested in following it at home. They did a detailed analysis of year-end data issued by the Independent Electricity System Operator and Ontario Power Generation. Basically, they reported, for the data for 2016, that the province of Ontario wasted a total of 7.6 terawatt hours of clean energy, an amount equal to powering more than 760,000 homes for one year, which is a value in excess of $1 billion.", "Paul Acchione is their energy expert and the former president and chair of the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers. I’m going to quote him now. He said, in answer to his own question of why Ontario is wasting all this energy, “‘Curtailment’ is an industry term that means the power was not needed in Ontario, and could not be exported, so it was dumped. It’s when we tell our dams to let the water spill over top, our nuclear generators to release their steam, and our wind turbines not to turn, even when it’s windy.", "“These numbers show that Ontario’s cleanest source of power is literally going down the drain because we’re producing too much. Speaking as an engineer, an environmentalist and a ratepayer, it’s an unnecessary waste of beautiful, clean energy, and it’s driving up the cost of electricity.”", "We also heard that the government recognized, just before this election, that energy rates going up over 300% in the province of Ontario is not going to get them very many votes. They figured out a bit of a scheme whereby they can borrow billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money from future generations, and pay billions of dollars in interest in the future—and we’re paying now as well—in order to subsidize, with ratepayers’ own taxes, their energy bills in order to make them feel they have actually done something to cut the cost of electricity.", "The cost of electricity did not go down. Your bills went down, but electricity costs just the same. The pages who are sitting here today, listening very attentively, are starting to realize that they are going to be paying higher taxes to pay for the electricity that we are using today just to heat this building. There’s something wrong.", "I have to commend the member just down the row from me for making the effort to remind everybody in Ontario—when there are so many other things going on and they’re not seeing their electricity rates necessarily go up—to make them realize that there is a problem here in Ontario that needs fixing." ],

It’s a study by the Oxford Martin School at the University of Oxford. I can read you the title of their study, Speaker: “Carbon Pricing Can Spur Economic Growth More Than We Thought, Says New Research.” This is what the research is now telling us—the impact of carbon pricing and the impact on reducing carbon emissions and carbon pollution and the positive effect it can have on our economy. I will talk more about that later: the very positive effect our cap-and-invest program is having on the economy right here in Ontario—and it’s measurable.", "We on this side of the House know that there is no choice but to act around climate change. I would have hoped that, in 2018, any discussion or any debate around climate change would be moot, that we would all understand and accept that it is a reality and that we have to take action. Again, standing by and doing nothing is not an option—not on this side of the House anyway.", "We know that when experts and scientists say that it’s time for action, we have absolutely no choice but to listen and take action. When 97%, 98%, 99% of the climatologists and meteorologists who publish tell us that the time for action is now, we have to listen; we cannot ignore it. We know that we can’t stand by and force our children and our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren to bear the consequences of doing absolutely nothing. That’s why this government has taken real, significant actions and real leadership to address climate change.", "In 2016, we introduced the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, which outlines the steps we’re taking to face climate change head-on. One of the most important parts of that act is putting a price on carbon. Our ministry spent a long time carefully considering our options for carbon pricing. We talked to the public. We talked to business. We talked to the ENGOs. We talked to others—anyone with an interest in climate change, in greenhouse gas pollution. We eventually decided that a cap-and-trade or—as I prefer to call it—a cap-and-invest program is the best way to ensure we’re reducing greenhouse gas pollution from business and industry at the lowest cost possible to the people and the businesses of this province. We can’t stand idly by. We have to have a very progressive policy, Speaker.", "We’ve seen that experts agree that cap-and-trade is the best way to put a price on carbon. In her January 2018 greenhouse gas reduction report, Ontario’s independent Environmental Commissioner said that “in terms of emission reductions, cap and trade outperforms the ... carbon tax.” She said, again, that cap-and-trade outperforms the carbon tax.", "The commissioner’s report also finds that Ontario’s cap-and-invest program will save almost all of us money—let me repeat that: will save almost all of us money—whereas a carbon tax would mean the cost for families and businesses would go up much more.", "As well, the commissioner recently said most jurisdictions are choosing to implement cap-and-trade programs because they reduce emissions for a lower cost. In fact, the stats are in. With China signalling that it’s putting a price on carbon, the vast majority of the industrialized world will have a price on carbon soon, and about 90% of them have chosen a cap-and-trade-type program.", "Back in December 2017, a report from EnviroEconomics said that our plan to cap emissions from business is almost three times more effective and costs only half as much as the carbon tax that was previously suggested by the PCs.

Threatening to turn back the clock in pursuit of a poorly defined, unaffordable and costly tax does the opposite of providing business certainty. It creates unnecessary risk. Inefficient, ineffective and unaffordable: That’s how I would define a scheme that costs more but does less.", "Our four auctions to date frankly show that businesses have confidence in our cap-and-trade market, and the market is functioning as it should. We are proud to say that third-party experts and businesses alike are confident in our best-in-class cap-and-trade program.", "Now, what is exciting about our program is that it does two things. First, and most importantly, it reduces greenhouse gas pollution. We have a limit—or a cap—on how much businesses are allowed to pollute. That limit goes down each and every year, Speaker, so each year, businesses are allowed to pollute less and less.", "The second thing our program does is, it reinvests in Ontarians. The cap-and-invest program has a trade component where businesses are allowed to buy allowances. The proceeds from our auctions last year alone generated $1.9 billion in proceeds. That $1.9 billion is being reinvested in programs that are helping Ontario homeowners live more sustainable lives at lower costs. Thanks to the four auctions, in the last year alone we’ve already invested hundreds of millions of dollars into green projects like transit, like electric vehicle incentives, like housing retrofits—things that help the people of Ontario fight climate change and save money at the same time.", "Our plan isn’t just about putting a price on carbon and reducing greenhouse gas pollution, though, Speaker. It’s also about investing in Ontario’s future and creating a fair society, where we all benefit from cleaner air, reduced energy costs and clean, sustainable, well-paying jobs.", "Independent economic analysis shows that our plan is the most effective and the most affordable approach, and is significantly cheaper than a stand-alone carbon tax. It is certainly more effective and more affordable than doing absolutely nothing, like so many of the PC leadership would have us do.", "Our plan encourages innovation. It drives investments to help Ontario continue to be a leader in the low-carbon economy. Meanwhile, again, the PCs have decided Ontario’s environment, I guess, is not worth protecting. I’m truly upset to see that they have decided climate change isn’t even worth fighting.", "You know, Speaker, tell that to the people of Brantford, who are experiencing, right now, very real impacts of climate change which, as we know, has caused severe flooding to their homes, their community and businesses. Will the next leader of the PC Party tell the people of Brantford that climate change isn’t real, that it’s not worth fighting? Frankly, I find that completely outrageous and irresponsible.", "As I mentioned earlier, I was at a screening of National Geographic’s Before the Flood, which is filled with real science and real people talking about the impact of climate change on them. We’ve been somewhat fortunate in southern Ontario not to feel the impact of climate change like other communities have, whether it be the forest fires that burned down a good portion of Fort McMurray and burned thousands of hectares of forest in BC and in California, the droughts of California, or the incredible hurricanes of the gulf coast and the Caribbean. We’ve been fortunate not to live on island communities that are flooding where a decision has to be made: “We have to relocate to another country because the sea is rising and washing away our island.” These things are real, Speaker.", "The day that I spoke at the last screening was just a couple of days ago. We were in the theatre. It was 15 degrees out—15 degrees Celsius outside, in February, Speaker, in February. It’s days like that that are driving up the levels of phosphorus in our lakes. My friends who are farmers in the Holland Marsh area talk about how the nutrients in their land, the very important nutrients in their lands, are being washed into the Holland River, which feeds Lake Simcoe, because their land is frozen and the rain is coming down and washing the nutrients into the lake.", "We were on track to reduce phosphorus in Lake Simcoe. We were doing a really good job of reducing phosphorus loads in Lake Simcoe, but because of the past few years and these incredible rains we have when the land is frozen, our phosphorus levels in that watershed are going up, a direct result of climate change.", "Things are heating up, Speaker, and scientists are predicting it’s only going to get worse as climate change brings stronger storms and more severe weather. I’m far from alone, as I said at the opening, in seeing climate change as the single greatest threat to our security and our prosperity.", "We made the choices that created this situation with the introduction of carbon fuels, the beginning of the industrial revolution, burning coal, burning oil, burning natural gas, those fossil-based fuels that make our way of life today possible. But we’re fighting climate change here in Ontario, Speaker; let me assure you of that. We’re fighting it through our cap-and-invest program. We’re capping greenhouse gas pollution. We’re investing the proceeds into further reducing greenhouse gas pollution. We’re really working hard through the funds to make life for everyday Ontarians easier. I’ll assure you, Speaker, that every penny we raise through our cap-and-trade auctions, every penny must be invested in projects that prevent or reduce greenhouse gas pollution. So far, we’ve announced more than a billion dollars’ worth of investments that reduce greenhouse gas pollution and other nasty air pollutants. We talk about carbon dioxide; it’s the primary gas that is causing climate change, but methane is equally bad. Methane leaking, for example, from dumps, from other sources, is equally bad. We need to deal with those and other nasty pollutants.", "We’ve invested in social housing, so that social housing providers can improve the insulation, replace leaky windows, and improve old boiler heating and air conditioning systems. The savings that they get from not having to do that work are invested into providing more facilities, more social housing and improved social housing. That’s just one.", "We’ve announced the same type of funding for hospitals across Ontario. They’re putting in money that they would have spent on upgrading insulation and improving windows. We can do it through the cap-and-trade program, so that they can take the savings and future energy savings and reinvest those in what they should be doing, which is patient care.", "We recently announced another program for universities and colleges, for $514 million. I was there with Minister Hunter to make a fantastic announcement that her ministry has pulled together. It’s the same thing: improvements and investments in insulation and windows, upgrading boilers and air conditioning systems. The money that those institutions would have to have put into their facilities, they can now invest in providing better education. Money that they will gain from energy savings, they can now put into providing better education. The list goes on, Speaker. Our schools are another great beneficiary.", "We’re supporting indigenous communities, as well. One of the sad truths about climate change is that the most vulnerable among us are the ones who did not create this problem. Quite frankly, our indigenous communities did not create the climate change. Their carbon footprint is so minuscule, yet they bear the brunt.", "I was in Moosonee and Moose Factory Island just this past summer, talking with local leaders about issues they face around food security. There is a direct link between climate change and food insecurity in our remote northern indigenous communities. Last year, the winter ice roads that are so important for transporting fuel and basic goods that they need to stock up on for an entire year—that winter road was not open long enough to move enough fuel, flour, sugar and coffee. All those essentials had to be flown in by airplane at great cost. You can imagine the cost of the diesel fuel that had to come in by airline.", "These are communities that are impoverished to begin with, and now face additional burdens brought about by climate change that they have to pay more for something they didn’t cause. That’s not right, and that’s why we have a responsibility, as a government, to do better.", "I want to take a final moment to talk about the opportunities. We’ve talked about the threat of climate change. We’ve talked about climate change as a real and present danger. The final point I want to talk about is the opportunities that are presented.", "Ten years ago, I’m not sure if any of us had heard about clean-tech industry. It really wasn’t high on the radar. But I can tell you that today, clean-tech industries, those industries that are focused on battling climate change, today number some 3,000 in Ontario alone. Yes, 3,000 clean-tech industries are located right here in Ontario. Many of them got their support through this government’s efforts. Those 3,000 companies employ some 65,000 Ontarians in an industry that, 10 years ago, virtually didn’t exist. The startling number, Speaker, is those 3,000 companies account for a little over $8 billion in revenues, $1 billion of which come from exports of service and product.", "So there is opportunity. There is a bit of a silver lining, we’ll say, to the issue around climate change, because Ontario has taken a leadership role in dealing with climate change. We have closed our coal-fired plants, which I’ve spoken about often here in the House. One of our single biggest sources of greenhouse gas pollution was our coal plants, and our Premier had the courage to shut them down. There are many benefits to adapting to and dealing with climate change, Speaker, but I will say that it starts with acknowledging that climate change is a real thing. It starts with understanding that human activity is the reason we are dealing with rapid climate change. And, frankly, it means that you have to acknowledge and have to put in place some type of plan to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and deal with the effects of climate change right across our society, for everyone.", "Speaker, I’ll end by saying that I stand in somewhat stunned disbelief at the activities of the past few weeks. Where I could have a good debate with the members opposite in the PC Party about which program to put a price on carbon is the best one—I’m happy to have that debate; I have the evidence to show cap-and-trade is the best system. But I can’t even have that debate now because the majority of the PC leadership candidates I don’t believe even believe in climate change because they have renounced a carbon tax, they’ve renounced putting a price on carbon, and they have renounced a cap-and-trade system. I don’t know what’s left. There’s no other system out there that’s left to deal with climate change in a timely manner.", "I’ll leave it there, Speaker, and turn the rest of my time over to my colleague." ],

It’s always good to have him in the House. Over the last number of years, I’ve had the opportunity to attend a number of events in his riding. I think we did two groundbreaking sessions together, at the new dairy research station in Elora and now the beef research station right across the road. He always shows great hospitality when I’ve been in the area. I just want to report, through you, Speaker, to him this afternoon that the construction of the beef research station is well under way. I think it’s going to be very important, as agriculture plays its role, of course, in fighting climate change in the province of Ontario. Those two research stations, and hopefully more down the road, will be critical, along with the great work—just a week ago, I had the opportunity to be with President Franco Vaccarino of the University of Guelph. We entered into a 10-year research agreement with the University of Guelph worth about $775 million over 10 years.", "We’re so happy to be a partner with the University of Guelph, all of us. I’ve always said that agriculture is a non-partisan issue. All 107 members in this House have a real interest in agriculture. The University of Guelph is now ranked amongst the top universities in the world when it comes to agricultural research. Part of that will be how agriculture will adapt to climate change in the 21st century.", "Madam Speaker, our youth are going to be playing such an important role as we continue to address climate change in this province. Look, you can see what youth can do. All of us have been following the very tragic circumstances in Florida, the loss of life of 17 very young people. Their future was just snuffed out in a matter of moments due to a deranged person who took their lives. We’ve seen how the youth in the United States are going to pressure American people in the Congress and the Senate to finally make changes to gun control rules south of the border.", "But we’re also seeing the same thing here in this province when it turns to climate change. Karan and I—our daughter, Shanae, is in her first year at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo. I got the opportunity to pick her up last Friday, because this week is a reading week break in the province of Ontario. Our son, Braden, is in second year at Trent University in environmental science. When I chat to both Shanae and Braden—and often their friends are in the kitchen in the Leal household in Peterborough—they’re talking about climate change. They’re really talking about the future, and what we need to do collectively to make sure that our planet is going to be there for them as they move through their careers in university and go on and seek their careers in their passion and ultimately contribute to this great province of Ontario.", "From a practical perspective, in the city of Peterborough, we had two 100-year storms in a two-year period, 2002 to 2004. I remember 2004 very, very clearly. It was July 15. I woke up, as I usually do, at about 6 a.m., and I went to the kitchen. One of the things I like to do when I’m home is that I like to make my wife coffee and get it ready for her. So I was busy that day getting the coffee ready, and I looked outside our kitchen window. Across the road from our home in Peterborough, there’s a golf course. All of a sudden, I looked out the window, and the golf course was like a reservoir of water. I figured out that something pretty significant had gone on in my community. Within a three-hour period, almost 200 millimetres of rain fell on Peterborough.", "The interesting thing about this was that, as Vice-President Al Gore now describes it, these rain bombs fell in a very short period of time of intensive rainfall. Of course, there was a flood in Peterborough, with extensive damage.", "The day after, then-Premier McGuinty came to Peterborough. The then Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, responsible for emergency measures in Ontario, Monte Kwinter, the very distinguished member from York Centre, in his role as minister, came to Peterborough to take a look at the damage. Of course, we were able to declare a state of emergency.", "Sylvia Sutherland, a good friend of mine, the longest-serving mayor in Peterborough’s history, in fact was the mayor when I got elected for the first time to Peterborough city council in 1985. I saw Sylvia just last night. We were at an event together in Peterborough. She quickly passed a resolution of council to declare Peterborough an emergency. That, of course, kicked in the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program in Peterborough. They were there when we needed them. Somebody nicknamed the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program as “Ontario Does Right At Peterborough.” The initials still work the same, so we remember that very well. Of course, that started the rebuilding process.", "But what I think has now taken place in the province of Ontario, and indeed in North America, is that when you talk to municipal engineers and municipal leaders, we really are starting to move from disaster management to disaster prevention. When we’re looking at our water and waste water treatment plants, all of that infrastructure that goes underground, we’re starting now to plan for the inevitability of these very volatile weather patterns that we’re now being faced with.", "Why is that so important? Well, when you talk to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, because of hurricanes in the United States—in many ways insurance becomes a vast pool, and we’re able to ascertain risk. If we don’t manage effectively our infrastructure going forward, there’s no question that property insurance rates will inevitably go up, because they’re pooling a risk, so we’ve got to make sure that we take preventive action in that area. That’s something that those of us, all 107 members—when we go to AMO now and ROMA, there has been a fundamental paradigm taking shift.", "Now the other thing is that, in 2016, there were five counties in Peterborough, including my own Peterborough county, that had the driest summer in 100 years. I remember it extremely well. As minister, I was taking a tour of fields that were parched. I was down in the Belleville area with my friend Lloyd Crowe, who is one of the largest soybean growers in that part of Ontario. Sadly, Madam Speaker, it brought tears to my eyes. I was in a field of soybeans, I grabbed one of the pods on one of the plants, I squeezed it and it turned to dust, it was so dry that year.", "Again, what took place was a localized drought. It covered five counties in the province of Ontario, but other parts of Ontario in the summer of 2016 got adequate rainfall. Then the reverse took place last summer, when the area of Peterborough got a lot. I was up with the member from Ottawa. We took a tour and, of course, the abundance of rainfall that occurred in the Ottawa area—again, those significant rain bombs, intense rainfall in a very short period of time, localized flooding and substantial damage, of course, to the crops in that area.", "More and more, Madam Speaker, we need to plan for the future. Of course, we’re doing that work. We’re seeing through the University of Guelph in terms of planning for the future and in terms of making agriculture more sustainable in a period of very volatile weather patterns brought about by climate change. We’re very pleased that through the legislative process, every dollar that we raise through the auctions of cap-and-trade is put back into Ontario’s economy. As the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change pointed out very clearly, this is a real plus for many businesses in the province of Ontario.", "Just last weekend, Family Day weekend, I had the opportunity to go to Mississauga and visit the Mississauga home show. What was so interesting about that is that a significant number of the vendors who were there last Sunday were advertising the GreenON program. These were small businesses that were in the roofing business, small businesses that were in the window business and small businesses that were in other things that we would use in our households to do renovations or retrofits. Of course, they were clearly advertising the benefits of the GreenON program.", "When we’ve had the opportunity to work with our colleagues, both in the province of Quebec and in California, the cap-and-trade program has been extremely successful. It has provided the opportunity for us to do significant reinvestment back into Ontario’s economy. I know all 107 members should reach out in their community to see how the GreenON is working very successfully with a number of business entities that are there.", "Madam Speaker, a number of months ago, of course, there was quite an almost Hollywood production when the people’s choice platform was unveiled. I believe my friend from Wellington–Halton Hills was at that event. There were lights, there was music, there was a lot of backdrop for the people’s choice platform that was being unveiled. What was interesting enough, having looked at budgets and doing the analysis, was that the underpinning of the people’s choice platform was a carbon tax. Everything in the people’s choice platform was predicated on a substantial revenue flow from a carbon tax in the province of Ontario to fund all the various elements of the people’s choice platform.", "Now, Madam Speaker, when you look at what’s being discussed today, everybody seems to be running away from the carbon tax, so I do have some questions. Whoever becomes the leader, they have the people’s choice platform still in place—and the people’s choice platform, all the component parts of that are predicated on revenue coming in from the carbon tax. Well, it’s going to be interesting. I think even Houdini would have a hard time trying to work with the people’s choice platform, not having the revenue coming in and of course continuing to advocate the components of that. Madam Speaker, I know I grew up in the south end of Peterborough, but I can tell you my Peterborough math tells me, as my friends in rural Ontario often say, that that dog doesn’t hunt. There is a gap there of at least $12 billion, but I suspect at some stage, the people’s choice platform will be reworked and voila. We’ll see how that is going to come about.", "Climate change is one of the great issues of the 21st century. Everybody is coming to grips with it. It’s so important that we engage in that. We’ve had the climate change action plan, we’ve had the Greenbelt Act and we’ve had the great lakes protection plan. These are the kinds of things that the next generation are expecting of government leaders here in the province of Ontario, to make sure that we’re addressing the question of the 21st century. That is indeed climate change.", "I just want to spend a few more minutes here talking about climate change. It’s the reality. We know that we have to do something about it, and we know that we must make sure that every part of the economy makes those adjustments to combat climate change. It is indeed looking at ways that we can improve our efficiency here in the province of Ontario, to take those dollars from the GreenON program and make sure—all Ontario needs to invest in that.", "I will be looking forward to how my good friends—I know my friend the member from Wellington–Halton Hills may be speaking on this issue soon. I will certainly be here as we get a very clear articulation where our good friends opposite, the opposition, stand on climate change. I know the people of Peterborough riding will be interested, Madam Speaker, because I do know that many of them right now—it is 4:20 p.m. in the afternoon—are just getting home after a very hard day at work. They have Cogeco cable TV, and I know they’re going to be tuning in to channel 95, the Ontario Legislature channel. They’ll be able to hear both our friends in the opposition, and indeed the third party, to see where they stand on government motion number 60, which is one of the great public policy debates of the 21st century.", "We are pleased that we’ve put a legislative mechanism in place and that the $1.9 billion that has been generated through cap-and-trade will go back into the economy. Every single dollar will be going back in from those proceeds from cap-and-trade.", "Madam Speaker, I’m very pleased that I’ve had the opportunity this afternoon to get a few comments on the record. I must say—I have to chat about this—last Saturday, as part of the Family Day weekend, I was out at Chemong Lake in the riding of Peterborough, at an event that was sponsored by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and my good friends—I’m a member—the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. We were ice fishing on Chemong Lake. But that is also a part of climate change, because we want to make sure that we retain a healthy climate and a good habitat for fish so that many more people, future generations, will have that opportunity on Family Day weekend to go out and enjoy ice fishing, a great experience.", "I must say, I didn’t catch anything, but it was a very nice experience to be out with many friends from around Peterborough riding, to have some hot chocolate and enjoy the camaraderie of that. In fact, Madam Speaker, what was really interesting was how many people from the greater Toronto and Hamilton area came to Chemong Lake in Peterborough riding that day to participate in Family Day ice fishing. I was hoping that maybe some of my friends from the opposition would have taken the opportunity to come out and join me. I would have shown them some grand Peterborough hospitality—", "Interjection." ],

I’ll read quickly the motion that the government has moved that we’re going to be debating:", "“We recognize that climate change is a real and present threat that is already costing Ontario families, and that Ontario should do its part in supporting national and international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas pollution at the lowest possible cost to families and businesses by putting a price on pollution to combat climate change.”", "I’m pleased to follow the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, who spoke first, and the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, who also contributed some remarks to this debate.", "The minister of agriculture and food mentioned me a couple of times in his speech, and yes, indeed, we welcome his visits to our riding every time he comes. I was delighted to be there with him when we turned the ground on the new beef research facility. I guess it was last summer, if I’m not mistaken. We’re excited that that research is going to be taking place. I think it shows our part of the world, in working with the University of Guelph, as the centre of agriculture research not only in Canada, but internationally as well. So we’re very excited about that and we appreciate the government’s willingness to partner with the University of Guelph.", "Certainly for my part, I’ve been excited to see the partnership renewed: some $700 million and something committed over the next 10 years. I’ve been so impressed every time I’ve visited the University of Guelph to become better acquainted and updated on the research that’s being done that is, in fact, leading the world and providing a positive future for agriculture in the province of Ontario and across the country.", "Why are we here discussing this issue this afternoon? The Minister of the Environment and Climate Change said something to the effect that he was kind of disappointed that this motion was necessary. The minister of agriculture and food was quite partisan in his remarks. It would appear to be a pattern, of course.", "Based on the two motions that were tabled late yesterday afternoon, one on the minimum wage issue and the other on climate change, it would appear that the government lacks a legislative agenda. They don’t have too many bills before the House. They don’t seem to want to bring forward or introduce government legislation. Of course, we are coming to the end of the government’s mandate. The election is scheduled for June 7. The writ period begins no later than May 9, I understand. So the government seems to have run out of legislative ideas, or at least if they have any ideas, they want to postpone the release of those ideas.", "We await the provincial budget. It’s coming sometime before the election is called, before the House is dissolved. There’s a possibility the House will be prorogued. All of these things are up in the air. But what is clear is the government does not have legislation that it wants to call for debate in this House, or at least a substantial legislative agenda, so they bring forward these motions in an effort to initiate debate and criticize the official opposition. That’s exactly what’s happening while we go through this leadership exercise that is under way and coming to a conclusion, as you know, Madam Speaker, on March 10.", "So, of course, our party is in the midst of a leadership debate discussion. There are candidates running. Each of the candidates has an opportunity to present their views. Our party membership has then the opportunity to elect a new leader and we will continue to undertake that process. But at the same time, I think it’s important that the government focus on its real responsibility, which is to provide leadership in the province while it has its mandate. We’ll see if its mandate is renewed or not, but while it has its mandate, which is right now, you’d expect and anticipate that there would be legislation introduced in the Legislature.", "I want to recognize the municipalities in my riding for the great work that they’ve done to combat and address the challenge represented by climate change. Right before Christmas, the mayor of the town of Halton Hills, Rick Bonnette, attended the North American Climate Summit in Chicago. He was invited to attend to talk about the initiatives that had been started at the town of Halton Hills to combat climate change. It was a real honour, I think, for him to be able to participate.", "It was really something for our community to receive that recognition, and I commend him for it, as well as the town council and staff, who do a great job on so many environmental initiatives. It illustrates, I think, that there is strong leadership not just from the national governments around the world, not just from the subnational governments around the world, but there’s also great action being taken by our local municipalities. In the case of the town of Halton Hills, they deserve that credit.", "I would also want to point out and acknowledge the great work that’s being done by the county of Wellington. As you know, Madam Speaker, they initiated something called the Green Legacy Programme with the audacious goal of planting 150,000 trees in the county of Wellington as a celebration of the 150th anniversary of the county. They had such success and such great buy-in and support from community partners that they decided to continue it year after year.", "It’s grown to become the largest municipal tree-planting program, I believe, in North America. It’s been recognized by the United Nations. The county of Wellington deserves enormous credit for the work that they’ve done, not just successive county councils and staff, but also the people in the county who have supported it, because it can’t be done just by the county. There’s support by a lot of community partners as well as a lot of volunteers.", "I’ve been so impressed by it that I brought this forward in the Legislature as a suggestion for the provincial government of what I viewed as a constructive, non-partisan suggestion that, as Canada celebrates its 150th anniversary, as we did last year, the province of Ontario should be doing something to celebrate 150 years of being part of a confederated Canada. Of course, the province of Ontario was established in 1867 as well.", "I was pleased that after bringing the issue forward in a number of ways, including as a private member’s resolution, that ultimately the new Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, the member for Cambridge at the time, agreed to promote this idea as a provincial program. They called it Ontario’s Green Leaf Challenge. It was a little different in terms of its name, but I was pleased and obviously appreciative that the Minister of Natural Resources recognized that this was something that we could promote.", "I’m not sure that the government did as much as it could have to promote the program. I think there would have been greater participation and buy-in by people across the province had there been greater promotion. I had suggested on a number of occasions that they allocate some of the advertising money that the government uses and, of course, is planning to spend on, in this case, what we see now as self-serving political advertising. Some of that money could have been set aside to promote the Ontario Green Leaf Challenge program. We would have had much more participation and buy-in. Unfortunately, apparently, that was not possible. However, I continue to encourage the government to promote and encourage volunteer tree-planting programs across the province.", "The issue of climate change has been debated and discussed in the Legislature over the years, as you know, Madam Speaker, in your time here. I think back to the member for Ottawa–Orléans, Phil McNeely, who was here for a number of years. I think he was first elected, if I’m not mistaken, in 2003. He brought forward a private member’s bill on three different occasions. I was looking through the Hansard; we looked at it again. In 2006, he brought forward Bill 139; in 2009, Bill 208; and in 2010, Bill 6. All of these bills were suggesting that we declare April 21 as Climate Change Awareness Day. Again, this goes back to 2006.", "I had a chance to speak in the Legislature as a private member when he introduced his bill at second reading in 2006. It was on October 5, 2006. During the course of my comments—again, this is 12 years ago, Madam Speaker—I acknowledged that climate change was a fact, that it was most likely caused by human activity and that governments around the world needed to engage in the appropriate actions to try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I said that in the House. Exactly what I said was this:", "“I think it is fair to say that whether you look at it as climate change or global warming, it is a real concern of many people in the province of Ontario. Certainly, it’s a huge concern for many people in Waterloo-Wellington; I’m amongst those people.” At that time, Madam Speaker, my riding was known as Waterloo–Wellington. I was privileged to represent that riding. “The preponderance of scientific evidence seems to suggest that human activity in recent years is at least accelerating this change, if not a contributing factor. So obviously it’s something that we all have to be concerned about, any of us who care about the future—and all of us should, obviously. As a father of three children—my wife and I are obviously very concerned about the world that our children and” hopefully “grandchildren will inherit. All of us should share this concern, and all of us should be part of the solution.”", "Of course, this contradicts the basic narrative of the Liberal government on this issue. They want to suggest that the Conservative Party, the official opposition, is denying that climate change is happening and is opposed to any steps to counter the challenge represented by climate change. In fact, I remember having a private discussion with one of the former Liberal members, a cabinet minister who told me that no Conservative member had ever spoken about this issue in the House. I was so upset, I went right back to my office, found the Hansard, and went up and approached him and showed him that in fact the Conservative Party has been on the record for many years acknowledging that climate change exists, acknowledging that human activity is a significant contributing factor and that we all have to be part of the solution.", "What is open for debate, I think, in a democracy is how to best take those steps to ensure that Ontario is part of the solution. That is the subject, I think, of some legitimate debate, obviously, and so that’s part of the discussion that we’re having today.", "The Minister of the Environment and Climate Change in his initial comments on this debate made reference to the reports of the Environmental Commissioner on climate change. I go back again to my debate contribution in 2006. At that time, the Environmental Commissioner of the province of Ontario was an independent officer of the Legislature, independent of government, and was quite critical of the Liberal government and suggesting that very little had been done in terms of a plan. In fact, the Environmental Commissioner’s most recent report at that time said “that the ministry does not have a formal written plan or strategy dealing with adaptation to climate change.”", "That was in 2006. Again, Madam Speaker, when I was standing in the House and acknowledging that it was a problem, the Environmental Commissioner was criticizing the government and saying that they had absolutely no plan to deal with it. Again, I think we have to take the government’s narrative on this issue with a grain of salt.", "This report from 2016, of course, was quite—actually, the initial report in 2016 by the current Environmental Commissioner, who came to my office on a number of occasions and brought me the report and gave me a great deal of her time to go through the contents and brief me on the recommendations—I would commend Dianne Saxe for the work she’s doing as Environmental Commissioner. I think she was a very good choice to serve as Environmental Commissioner, and I always look forward to our interactions. When she is prepared to meet with any member of the Legislature, I think they would be well advised to listen to her advice and suggestions. But again, this report in 2016 was, I think, very helpful in terms of the discussion and the debate that has ensued ever since.", "She commented on Bill 172, the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016, which was passed by the Legislature in May 2016. As you’ll recall, Madam Speaker, that was the enabling legislation, really, to set up the cap-and-trade program. Our party voted against that bill because we were opposed to cap-and-trade. At the time, we were very concerned that the whole program—in fact, the evidence that we saw from how cap-and-trade had worked in Europe caused us many concerns about how it might unfold here. We believed it would be overly bureaucratic. We believed it would force companies to send millions of dollars to California to purchase cap-and-trade credits, and we were concerned that the proceeds of the cap-and-trade auctions would become part of a Liberal slush fund.", "The government, in response to that concern, was prepared to make a promise that all the proceeds from the cap-and-trade auctions would go into environmental programs. We were highly skeptical of that. We look forward to the details on that. Again, the government maintains that that is the case, but we remain to be convinced on that score.", "At the same time, we think that many of the concerns we expressed about the cap-and-trade program have in fact come to fruition." ],

I was pleased to receive this report in the intersession, when the House wasn’t in session. I think it’s important to point out some of the recommendations and observations that were in the report.", "The Environmental Commissioner indicated that since cap-and-trade was introduced, the government has raised $1.9 billion from the first four auctions, with $1.37 billion allocated since November. But the report indicated that the USA’s decision to pull out of the Paris agreement is a complicating factor in terms of Ontario’s plan to count emission reductions in California as our own.", "Of course, we all have our opinions and observations about the American political scene and what’s going on in the United States today. But it is obviously up to the Americans to decide who they’re going to choose to be president, and who is going to be elected to the Congress. We have to work with whoever is elected. But at the same time, as we know, the Americans have pulled out of the Paris agreement.", "It’s hard to predict what’s going to happen from day to day in the United States, in their current political scene. If there’s a change in the White House in a couple of years’ time, and if Congress changes over, there’s obviously a chance that that situation will continue to evolve, but that remains to be seen.", "We’re told that 99% of the $1.37 billion allocated met the requirements of the climate act. Apparently, the government has set caps on carbon allowances for every year until 2030, in an attempt to deal with predictability issues raised by businesses, and we are told that Ontario emitters can use the carbon market to raise capital to update their equipment.", "There were some observations by the Environmental Commissioner which suggested that the government needs to do more and improve its performance. She said that roughly 18% of Ontario’s greenhouse gas emissions, including methane and nitrous oxide from waste, agriculture and forestry, are not covered by cap-and-trade.", "We were told that Ontario’s current climate policy lacks clarity on how to reduce the 18% of Ontario greenhouse gas emissions not covered by cap-and-trade. Offset credits could allow capped emitters to pay these uncapped sectors to reduce their emissions, flowing money to rural communities.", "She also observed that the government’s pledge to make its own operations carbon-neutral currently covers less than half of the true greenhouse gas footprint. The Ontario government currently does not know the greenhouse gas footprint of what it buys. It does not give that greenhouse gas footprint significant weight in procurement decisions, and the current government does not set aside emissions reductions targets for what it buys or what it reports on its progress.", "The Environmental Commissioner also pointed out that freight trucks are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. They have more than doubled since 1990. Subsidies for natural gas trucking are not likely to reduce emissions. Instead, the commissioner noted, the government should encourage the freight sector to avoid trucking, through logistics and road pricing; improve diesel truck efficiency through providing incentives to companies to scrap older diesel vehicles; and shift freight away from fossil fuels—for example, providing more targeted support for zero-emission trucks.", "Many of these recommendations, of course, are quite technical in nature, but I would hope and anticipate that the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change and the ministry staff are reviewing and evaluating them, and we would hope to see an appropriate response from the government.", "I think it’s also interesting to point out the fact that we know that Hydro One has purchased a US coal plant, and the provincial government seems to miss the inconsistency that exists on this issue. They would have us believe that they’ve done wonderful things by closing the coal-fired plants in the province of Ontario, and yet at the same time, having sold controlling interest in Hydro One, Hydro One has purchased a dirty coal plant in the United States.", "I know, from my days as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of the Environment, we were always told that half of the air pollution in the province of Ontario came from US sources. Obviously, the airshed doesn’t necessarily respect the political boundaries between the two countries.", "The government has really never given a satisfactory explanation as to how this is not a huge inconsistency in terms of their climate change policy and program. It also reminds me of the fact that in 2003—this is something that the Minister of the Environment had said in his speech, patting himself on the back for the fact that the government has closed the coal plants across the province, the coal-fired generating stations.", "The government seems to forget, or wants to forget, that it was our Minister of the Environment Elizabeth Witmer who was the first Minister of the Environment to announce the proposed closure of a coal-fired electricity generating station, that being the Lakeview Generating station. She announced that when we were still in government.", "Interjection." ],

I remember the commitment of the Liberal Party at that time was to close all the coal-fired electricity generating stations by 2007. They maintained it could be done in four years.", "We had had a briefing as a government caucus by senior staff of, I believe, the Ministry of Energy—but they could have been Hydro One staff; I can’t remember—senior staff who had had a detailed briefing about the technical challenges represented by the commitment. Again, it was a consensus, I believe, amongst all three parties, that this was a desirable goal and we would try to do it. We were told that it couldn’t be done until I think 2014, if I’m not mistaken.", "During the election campaign, when this issue came up and I was asked, I answered the question honestly. I said that from what I understood, our party wanted to do the same thing, close the coal-fired electricity generating stations, and we would hope to be able to do it by 2014. The Liberal candidate who was running against me said, “Our Liberal Party is committed to doing it by 2007.”", "As you know, Madam Speaker, as it turned out, that promise was broken, and it was broken again, and I think it was broken a third time, because each time the government said it was going to be able to close the coal-fired electricity generating stations by a specific date; and then, when they discovered it wasn’t possible, practical or doable, they set another date farther out. I believe it was broken three different times. Ultimately, if I’m not mistaken, those coal-fired electricity generating stations were closed around 2014 or 2015, exactly when we had been told when we were in government it could be done.", "It was another long list of broken promises by the Liberal government. It’s ironic, perhaps, that they continue to boast about the fact that they’ve achieved this, but it took them far longer than they had indicated in that first election in 2003, and that is a fact.", "I also wanted to mention something, because this was brought up by the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, about the flooding that we’re experiencing right now in the province. Of course, the Grand River is an important geographical feature of my riding of Wellington–Halton Hills. We are all very concerned about the flooding that has taken place in Brantford and the terrible tragedy that apparently took place in Dufferin county, where the child may have been swept away by the river, from what we’re reading. Our thoughts and prayers are obviously with that family. I can hardly imagine what they’re going through right now.", "We do have the latest information from the Grand River Conservation Authority—who, I would add, do an extraordinary job. I’ve worked with their staff over the years, and they do a great job in terms of their mandate and their responsibility in terms of flood control. But this extraordinary event that we’re experiencing right now because of the unusual weather—we do have an update.", "I know that the Speaker of the Legislature, the Honourable Dave Levac, had to go home yesterday to demonstrate his concern and interest. I gather the Premier was there, too. But we’re thinking of them today, and I hope that the government is prepared to take whatever steps are necessary and whatever steps are possible to assist the community of Brantford. It appears a state of emergency has been declared. But certainly in these situations, there is an obligation on the part of the provincial government to ensure that everything that can be done is done to assist those communities.", "The flood warning is also in effect for the township of Puslinch in Wellington county in my riding and the township of Woolwich, St. Jacobs and West Montrose in Waterloo region. The city of Cambridge is also involved. There’s a long list of communities along the Grand River watershed where there’s still a flood warning in effect, and a flood watch. We would encourage everyone, if they live near the river or anywhere close, or if they’re going close by, to follow very carefully the recommendations of the Grand River Conservation Authority, as well as any of the other local authorities to ensure that they are safe.", "I also would like to inform the House of the conversations—many conversations, actually—that I’ve had with constituents who have brought concerns to my attention with respect to climate change. I have three very vocal and interested constituents who have come to see me quite frequently to talk about the suggestions and the initiatives of the Citizens’ Climate Lobby—which is, I think, a worldwide organization, but there is a Canadian chapter. Those constituents are Gord Cumming, Liz Armstrong and Ron Moore. They came to see me most recently on February 9. They’ve given me a lot of really interesting research that has been done on this issue. I really want to express my appreciation for the time that they take to study the issue—I think they’re going about it in a very non-partisan and professional way—and then to bring in turn the latest updated academic research that they would want me to read.", "They brought to my attention a study that was done by Dr. David Robinson, who is a professor at Laurentian University in Sudbury, about carbon pricing. It is something I would commend to all members of the Legislature who are interested in this issue, because what they are proposing is not a cap-and-trade program. In fact, they don’t believe that’s the best way, but they believe that a carbon-fee-and-dividend approach is the best way to not only have a fair system but also to reduce emissions effectively. I think it is something that has informed our thinking on this side of the House and it has what led, in large part, to our position that we took in the People’s Guarantee.", "Now, again, the government’s objective this afternoon is to try to sow discord and cast aspersions on the opposition parties—in particular, the official opposition—on this issue. I’m certainly prepared to acknowledge the fact that our People’s Guarantee platform, after extensive consultation with our membership and with people all across the province, was introduced to the people of Ontario on November 25. Since that time, of course, our leader has resigned, our leadership process has commenced, and there continues to be discussion about these issues—and there will be. That’s expected and that’s normal when there is a leadership campaign.", "The various candidates will take their various positions, and someone will emerge as the leader.

I was quite happy to talk about our party’s position, and here’s what I said on November 29. In fact, I was quite excited to see that the Toronto Star had in fact endorsed, at least to some degree, what we were saying in the People’s Guarantee. They called it “a serious plan that will deserve serious consideration from voters.” At this time, I said, “Included in this plan are strong statements about the need to protect and preserve our natural environment. Our caucus accepts the scientific consensus on climate change. The earth is warming, and human activity is a significant contributing factor. We in Ontario need to do our part to reduce carbon emissions.” I continue to believe that. I think all the members of the House accept that as sort of a bedrock statement on this issue.", "But we also pointed out the government’s plan for a cap-and-trade scheme will ship approximately “466 million taxpayer dollars to California.

But we also know that doing nothing is not an option.” We were aware, and still are, that the Trudeau government in Ottawa appears to be moving forward to mandate a “carbon-pricing benchmark.” I said that no one likes new taxes or new fees, and nobody wants them, but at the same time, I think it’s a practical reality that all provinces are going to have to respond if the federal government pursues this approach, and that certainly appears to be what the federal government is planning to do.", "We said that we believe that there is a better way for the people of Ontario, and that if the federal government is forcing this on us, we’re suggesting that “every dollar collected in carbon price revenue should be returned to Ontario families and taxpayers in the form of corresponding tax relief, as verified by the Auditor General.”", "I would suggest, Madam Speaker, that we need to ensure that the Auditor General has all the information that he or she needs. We know that the current government is in a fairly significant dispute with the Auditor General over accounting standards, and we on this side of the House have accepted the approach taken by the Auditor General, who’s an independent, non-partisan officer of the Legislature. We believe that the points she’s making are valid ones. We believe the government should not be challenging the Auditor General in terms of what she’s saying and in terms of what should be accepted accounting practices for our government. Her role is obviously very, very important, and I think in terms of validating the fact that if there is carbon pricing of any sort, that it is in fact revenue-neutral. To have that seal of approval from the Auditor General would do a great deal to ensure that the people of Ontario actually believe it is revenue-neutral.", "I talked about that on November 29, and then the following week, before the House rose in December, I again brought up my concerns as our party’s environment critic, suggesting that, of course, “the Liberal government is prepared to say literally anything to hang on to power.” The Premier had criticized our proposal to phase out their cap-and-trade program and replace it with a carbon-pricing program in line with what the Trudeau government is requiring but that at the same time would return all of the revenue to Ontarians. She was suggesting it would cost more and would not be as effective in reducing carbon emissions.", "But there was a huge article you may recall, Madam Speaker, in Maclean’s magazine which showed that those claims were patently false. In fact, the article, with credible evidence, suggested that the People’s Guarantee would do the exact opposite. There was a study by economist Trevor Tombe suggesting that our plan at the time would leave Ontario households better off than what the Liberals say and would reduce emissions more in Ontario than under their cap-and-trade program.", "Again, I think as we get close to the election, the Liberals are going to be making a lot of statements and observations, but we know that the Liberal Party is prepared to do and say whatever it takes to get into power, stay in power, to hang on to power. I would suggest that the people of Ontario are going to take a good, hard look at some of these statements.", "As you know, Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, our party is in the midst of a leadership process. That’s no secret. Everyone who is paying attention knows about it. The Liberal government, because they lack a legislative agenda, are trying to bring forward these government motions. The two that were tabled yesterday, the one we debated this morning and this one we’re debating this afternoon, are intended to try to create—" ],

He acknowledged the county of Wellington, but he, too, has stepped up.", "He brought a very valid point that, had the government of the day, the Liberal government, actually put some of the money from their self-serving politically motivated partisan electioneering ads, we could have gone well past that goal, to ensure that and truly show action for the environment rather than just some hot air that went into the environment.", "He talked about the cap-and-trade realities of Europe and what was tried there and the poor record that happened there that was overly bureaucratic. A lot of money went to California. Proceeds would go into a Liberal slush fund that they could use wherever they want. The sad part, that I hear from people across the province, is they see that money being used—instead of for things like mental health, long-term care or social and community services—for the some of the waste and mismanagement fiascos that we’ve heard about in this House.", "I think he spoke about, again—the Auditor General talked to it—that there could be more done to improve performance. In the report that came out, it said a lot of the things that the government has put out lack clarity, Madam Speaker. So, again, it isn’t just us as opposition; it’s us utilizing the knowledge that we’ve gained from independent officers of this House that have brought that.", "He talked about Hydro One. They actually, with this government’s support, purchased a coal plant from the United States. He talked about how 50% of the pollution in the air in Ontario actually comes from the US. So they go on and on and on about coal—I think he reiterated, as well, that one of our former members, the very esteemed Elizabeth Witmer, was the first minister to actually announce the closure of Lakeview generating station. The Liberals came to power and promised to close all plants by 2007—another broken promise, Madam Speaker. Those were not actually closed until 2014 or 2015, yet they keep coming back to us. Premier Davis was one of the first people to move the environmental movement with a lot of initiatives across this great province.", "It was interesting to hear about the Auditor General. One of the things that we’ve said from day one when we’ve had this discussion is that nobody is denying that there is a need to move forward and to do that. Particularly, what he referenced were his three children and, hopefully, someday grandchildren. I’m the same. I have two boys and I hope that someday we’ll have grandchildren, to have a better province than what we have today. But what we need is to make sure that that money isn’t just being used for those slush fund types of activities, or other endeavours. We want to make sure that it actually is revenue-neutral and that people of Ontario know what they’re getting. I think it made great sense that the Auditor General could verify all those resources and revenue sources coming in, and ensure that it’s returned to the people of Ontario.", "We want to make sure that we’re not getting into, as the current Liberals are, fighting with someone like our Auditor General—a third party, at arm’s length from the government, an officer of this Legislature—and challenging accepted auditing principles. Madam Speaker, we really owe it to the people we serve to ensure that we trust those people and that we allow them to move forward when they’re bringing up concerns in regard to something as significant as accepted auditing principles. That should raise alarm bells with everyone out there, Madam Speaker.", "I also want to, just before I move on to another thought process, ask the government—conservation authorities have been here a number of times. Dick Hibma is a fellow from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. He’s been the chair, I believe, of the Grey Sauble Conservation Authority for 20-plus years, and he is the chair of Conservation Ontario. They have had numerous discussions. They’ve lobbied us here—not just me in my riding, but all of us and, I’m sure, the Liberal government.", "Those funding levels have been frozen for many, many, many years. For a government that talks about environment, here is an agency that actually does great work out in all of our communities, to ensure that the environmental concerns are addressed, and yet they have flat-lined them for many, many, many years, Madam Speaker. That group has come numerous times with budget requests saying, “Please up the amount that you’re going to give us, so we can continue to do even more work.” They download all kinds of things—“You shall, you will”—and this will become another regulation, more red tape and administration. But they never give any money there.", "So I want to do a huge shout-out personally to Dick Hibma, who has done a great job in 20 years of service on the Grey Sauble Conservation Authority, for all that he has done. I want to carry that message on his behalf to the government again, because there is a budget, I trust. Well, it’s probably written, I would guess. We’ll see when that is actually put here in the House, or whether we actually even debate it. I hope that if they’re truly sincere about this, we actually do this.", "We want to talk a little bit again about this whole theory, and one of the challenges that we’ve had in regard to whatever we want to call it: the cap-and-trade, or the carbon taxes. They talk about all of the money coming back to Ontario. I believe it was the Minister of Agriculture—I’m going to quote, because I believe what he said was that every dollar raised goes back into the Ontario economy.", "Madam Speaker, I want to ask him some things about if those polluting companies can buy carbon tax credits from a company on the market. They may be anywhere. They could be in California, because I heard “California” about a dozen times when the ministers on the other side of the House were speaking. They can buy the credits, but they never actually have to stop creating any of the pollution. So all of those pollutants that we’re worried about keep going up into our atmosphere, but they can actually pay money to get it there, and it’s going to be millions and billions of dollars, Madam Speaker, that actually supports the California economy, not the Ontario economy." ],

I’d like to ask the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change if he’s in agreement with the veterans out there who, right now, are challenging the Prime Minister of the day on how he’s treating our veterans who have given their lives for us and who have actually sacrificed and gone to war for us—whether they have the right to challenge the Prime Minister or not.", "The Minister of Ag, again, talked about a number of things. He talked about gaps, and he talked about Houdini. Madam Speaker, I’d like to ask him—$4 billion was actually moved purposely by this government on to the OPG’s set of financial books so they could say that they balanced the budget, ironically, in the next election we’re going to have on June 7. The Auditor General has challenged those accounting principles, and yet he uses the word “Houdini” about us in here. I think the people of Ontario might wish to ask that type of a question.", "I wonder how the Minister of Agriculture can support spending $11 billion on interest payments as a result of their overspending. That’s more than the whole community and social services budget spends on behalf of the province of Ontario. Those are the people in need, the people out there across all of our great communities who need help in their time of need. Yet, he continually supports overspending and spending the third-biggest government expenditure, being debt payment, and they just added—Madam Speaker, as I trust you’re well aware—$25 billion more. They went out, knowing all of this is happening, and borrowed $25 billion to give a two-year rebate on hydro rates that actually increased between 300% and 400% over the term of their tenure over the last 12 to 14 years.", "I wonder whether that gap is something that he might wish to address in the House sometime and explain to the people of Ontario how he can support borrowing $25 billion, which is going to cost, down the road, $43 billion to $93 billion, again according to the Auditor General. This isn’t me making these up. The fiscal accountability officer and the Auditor General have used those numbers. When you look at the great pages sitting here in front of us, who are going to actually incur this debt burden, how can you comfortably do that over there and then still come out and say things like we’re the ones like Houdini?", "Madam Speaker, I’d like the Minister of Ag—because he talked a fair bit about this stuff—to come back at some point and share with the Legislature and the great people of Ontario how much the Liberals have paid to the US and Quebec to take surplus energy. A number that I certainly continue to hear is $6 billion that they’ve paid to Quebec and the US to actually work against our economy. We don’t give it away. We actually pay them to take it—$6 billion. We’ve been closing schools. You’re a former school teacher, Madam Speaker. We’ve been closing schools, but we’re paying $6 billion out to economies to make them more competitive against our own people here. I’m not certain how that gap is something he could support.", "I’d like to ask how many jobs were created by the Green Energy Act. There were large numbers when they brought this out—and let’s not forget that with that policy they usurped local autonomy. They usurped the ability for local councils to actually make a choice and the people who elect them to have a choice of whether they want wind turbines in their backyard or don’t want them in their backyard. They did a lot of it saying, “We’re going to create all of these jobs.” I’d like them to give us a definitive number that’s against the number they originally gave when they brought the Green Energy Act out." ],

So we can either use wind energy at about 15 cents a kilowatt, or solar, in its earliest iterations at 82 cents a kilowatt, now 40 to 42 cents, and it’s still intermittent. You then fire up a gas plant to actually bring the power back when you do need it.", "I try to figure out, from an environmental perspective, how can you, with clear conscience, suggest you’re going to turn off Niagara Falls and not capture clean, free, green energy sources and actually do the other side and support turning on a gas plant? It makes no sense to me, especially when you consider three cents to 82 cents in the earlier iterations of that Green Energy Act.", "I’d like the Minister of Agriculture to share with the great people of Ontario how much the global adjustment has cost the people and particularly the businesses of the province, because those businesses need to be able to be effective. They could be putting that money into more energy-efficient operation. They could be doing things that are containing and limiting their actual environmental footprint. But when they’re paying it into a tax because they have overpaid for subsidies for certain forms of power, then I wonder how much that is, and I wonder how much that total dollar value is at the end of the day.", "I know when the first debate came out about carbon, it was asked in this House if they would put a line item on the energy bills of what the cost of carbon was going to be, and they declined that. We wonder why they would decline that. And we also wonder, if they would decline that, why would they, again, not allow this to go under the auspices of the Auditor General, to be able to truly take all of those revenue sources and be the verification point, and make a pledge to ensure that the people of Ontario know that it’s revenue-neutral and that if they’re paying it out, it’s coming back in some form of service to all of the people of Ontario, who are actually responsible and are going to be the most impacted by that.", "Switching gears a little bit, I go back, because of what has happened—and I believe my colleague very appropriately acknowledged the sadness shared for the little fellow who was lost in the river recently and to all of the family who are going through that. Again, I send out a message to all people: The waters are running fast. Do not allow anyone to go. Even adults should not be going close to that fast-rushing water. Just in Chesley, Ontario, in my riding, one of the bridge abutments has collapsed partially because of the raised water levels and flooding conditions. With everyone out there, we’re going through that time right now—spring runoff or whatever we want to call it. It’s happening, so I just implore everyone to be very, very cautious and ensure that we don’t have to have any more of these tragedies.", "But it brings me back to a few years ago, with a similar type of situation. Owen Sound suffered major losses in 2015, with water mains being frozen. It was unprecedented: 317 frozen services and 50 water main breaks, costing the city $2.1 million to remedy. The government led us to believe that it would be there for municipalities when they needed it the most from these climate-type disasters. If you’re going to charge things like a carbon tax, you would expect, and I think the people of Ontario would say, that in those types of times, you want to know that that money collected from carbon tax is going back into other types of environmental challenges that the people are suffering. After all, there is only one taxpayer. Whether it’s municipal, provincial or federal, there is only one taxpayer.", "When we asked on behalf of Owen Sound, the government said no. In fact, it really did nothing to help Owen Sound constituents, despite there being a strong case for that disaster relief assistance. In the end, Owen Sound managed to replace about 1.5 kilometres of water mains. But as you can imagine, the crisis emptied their reserve fund. In a very small tax base, over years, they were doing that.", "Again, there has been a lot of gas tax money that my colleague John Yakabuski from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke has asked about, I think, eight or nine times in here. Regrettably, again, the Liberals have voted against that every time. So that could have been shared across the whole province, and there would have been more money in the actual coffers of Owen Sound to do this.", "At the end of the day, it’s very challenging for a small tax base to be able to accumulate the things to replace all of that infrastructure, and it puts great limits on their ability to respond to these types of unexpected things. It took the city 10 years to build up that reserve and only a few days without assistance to empty it. Those are the types of things for which, I think, regardless of political stripe, people want to know that in times of need your government is there for you and they’re going to come to step up for you. I’m sure, this past winter, there have been municipalities in a very similar boat. Many of the municipalities have had their own funding actually decreased and, again, will suffer from some of this type of thing.", "When we’re looking at things in regard to how we’re taxed and where taxation is used, you want to make sure that it comes to you and it’s there in time to help those people out. Whether you want to say the municipality, the county, the regional government or the people of the province, it’s about people, Madam Speaker. We need to ensure that our government is always putting the people first. It brings me back a little bit to the thought from my colleague from Wellington–Halton Hills in regard to that—and it’s blatant at the end of the day." ],

It’s unheard of that the government has already stopped debating—threw us for a loop there.", "Considering Bill 70 is such an important act—it came out of the fall economic statement. Fall economic statements aren’t usually as large as this bill that they’ve brought forward. It’s quite an omnibus bill that is really sneaking through the Legislature. I think more people should be made aware of what is actually going on in this legislation before it comes to bear fruit.", "Basically, Bill 70 is An Act to implement Budget measures and to enact and amend various statutes. This act, the Building Ontario Up for Everyone Act, amends 27 statutes, enacts four new statutes and repeals three others. It’s unfortunate that the government has had to come with such a large omnibus bill at this point, because over the last 13 years we’ve totally seen how this government has made life harder and more unaffordable for all Ontarians.", "This budget, unfortunately, is not going to do very much—or very little—to help the unaffordability of people living in this province. This bill is more of a distraction to look like this government is doing something when, at the same time, they are making life harder and harder.", "Ontario will remain in a dire fiscal state, and people are going to find it harder and harder to make ends meet at the end of each month when their bills come due. Unfortunately, the government, under Premier Kathleen Wynne, has no plan to get their books back on track that doesn’t involve higher taxes, selling off our hydro, increasing hydro rates or cutting front-line health care services.", "The fact that there was barely a mention of hydro rates in this government’s fall economic statement speaks volumes to the deaf ear that this government has given the people of Ontario, who have spoken out day in and day out with regard to the lack of policy and the high rates they are charged on their energy bills.", "This bill, after amending 27 statutes, enacting four statutes and repealing three others, shouldn’t be needed if the government was in such a great financial state. But after debate so far, which the government is not speaking to, our heads are shaking. What are Ontarians to think of this province, which is way off track?", "As I mentioned earlier, the economic statement made little mention of energy rates. Energy rates across this province are skyrocketing, and this government has done very little to deal with the outrageous hydro bills. Reports show that the wind turbines and solar panels that this government put so much emphasis on do not create or generate enough energy to sustain this province, and cause us to utilize more natural gas to make sure the baseline power is continued.", "Mr. Speaker, we are already shipping the extra energy that the wind and solar are creating and we’re paying high exorbitant prices on down to the United States. We’ve become the economic driver of Michigan and Pennsylvania, and that’s unfortunate.", "At the same time, this government continues to award contracts and wind energy to municipalities who are unwilling hosts. Today, I just delivered a petition of 1,800 signatures—which is probably close to 30% or 40% of the population in that area of the province—to this government, stating that the wind turbine contract that they awarded last March is not wanted.", "The municipality themselves had reached out to the Minister of Energy last year, leading up to the awarding of the contract, and earlier this year, to tell them they were an unwilling host and did not want this project. It’s unfortunate, though, that the government refused to listen to the people of Dutton Dunwich, 84% of whom voted no in a referendum on this wind turbine.", "Last week, the Premier apologized for her and her government’s actions on the energy file. It’s one thing to say you’re sorry; it’s another thing to follow through and show that you truly are sorry. The best way to do this would be to say to the people of Dutton Dunwich, “We are sorry. We have shot energy rates through the roof. We are sorry we didn’t listen to what the municipality wanted. We are sorry the people of Dutton Dunwich have to accept these wind turbines. We are going to cancel the project.” That’s what this government should be doing. There’s still time to do so. There are “out” clauses in the contract that was signed in March that would get this government out of those contracts. Otherwise, from our calculations, over the lifespan of this contract it will cost the ratepayers $250 million. That’s more money that we cannot really justify expending on energy that we don’t need.", "Small businesses in my riding, due to these energy rates, have seen their hydro go from $1,300 a month to $3,000 a month; and $2,000 of that bill is the global adjustment and delivery fees alone. People go, “What’s the global adjustment?” Well, the global adjustment is basically the difference it costs to make the energy rates and the amount that we’re paying the green energy companies for those wind and solar projects. In the original solar contracts we paid 80 cents a kilowatt hour. So if it’s taking six or seven cents to make the energy, somewhere that amount has to be made up, and they make it up in the global adjustment, which we’re all paying. It’s either a line item—if we utilize enough energy, there is actually a global adjustment charge on our bill. If we’re not using a ton of energy, like the majority of us, it’s into our rates.", "We were up in Kenora this past summer. There are two dams in Kenora that produce energy for pennies—one or two cents a kilowatt hour—that have shut down because of the contracts of the wind and solar this government has signed for 40 cents, 50 cents, 80 cents a kilowatt hour. But we’ve shut down the most renewable source of energy—water, which we built our province on. We’ve shut them down because we’ve created so many contracts of this high energy. This government has a deaf ear and a blind eye to what’s going on in the province.", "There are just numerous, numerous articles in the newspapers, and numerous polls. Energy is the number one topic people are talking about, and I don’t think there’s anybody who is quite happy with the role this government has taken on. So it’s time that this government steps up. If they’re going to write an omnibus bill, why didn’t they at least do something for energy in this bill? Why won’t they step forward and do something for the people of Dutton Dunwich in my riding and say, “We’re listening; we’re going to shut down that wind contract that we signed”? Unfortunately, they’ve stopped doing so.", "Mr. Speaker, in regard to health care, health care is really not mentioned in this omnibus bill. Right now in committee we have Bill 41, which will be going through the amendment process on Wednesday. It was quite interesting that, through all the deputations on Bill 41, we didn’t hear from one doctor or patient group who was consulted on this legislation. So, as I mentioned earlier about energy rates and the fact they’re not listening to people with regard to energy, they’re not listening to people with regard to health care. You just have to go back and look at how this government has mismanaged the health care sector: We’ve now started to ration health care throughout the province.", "You see in your riding, Speaker, and probably in many of the ridings here, that when it comes to knee and hip surgeries, when the year starts, on April 1, by October they’re out of money. So if you need a hip or knee replaced, you’ve got to wait for the next fiscal year, which is why the wait-list continues to grow and grow and grow. In fact, we’ll see the Fraser report that they released last week showing that wait times are increasing.", "The government over there will say, “We’re the best of all the provinces because the Fraser report has said so,” but if you look at the Commonwealth Fund, which the majority of people do when you compare countries, Canada is 12th on wait times. The States are ahead of us, Denmark, UK, Sweden—the countries that we look up to in the health care system. We’re last. If the government is happy with being the best of the worst, that’s up to them to do so, but it doesn’t benefit the patients in Ontario. We can do so much better. Unfortunately, the government is doing nothing with this bill. Bill 41 is also another bill that is out of touch.", "Mr. Speaker, this government, over time, has had many experiments in the health care sector that have failed and cost Ontarians more money. Look at Ornge; the diabetes registry this government tried to create—20-some-odd-million dollars—they just cancelled it; the personal support worker, about $10 million gone; eHealth, we’re talking billions of dollars. We’re waiting on the Auditor General report that’s coming out; it’s going to shed some light on eHealth—however, billions of dollars of what we have to offer.", "The CCACs and the LHINs: This government has truly mismanaged both of those. We saw that in the Auditor General’s report last year, stating that 39% of all the money going to the CCAC stays within the bureaucracy. We’ve seen the LHINs—with regard to the management of the LHINs, they’re unable to fully integrate health care. The Auditor General pointed out that they actually failed and didn’t come close to achieving their goals. Now the government is going to give them more power. Unfortunately, Bill 70 doesn’t really touch on health care.", "Another item that people have been talking about or debating is, in Ontario—it affects a lot of people in this Legislature—600 schools are set to close under this government, mainly in rural Ontario. In my riding, we have a number of schools that will be closing, which is unfortunate.", "I bring up Springfield in our riding. Springfield is a small, tight-knit community, way off into the east part of our county. That school is so integral to that part—I go to their Remembrance Day ceremony every year. It’s at 9:30, and the whole school comes down to the cenotaph. We have a great ceremony. Speaking with the municipal councillors there—who, by the way, weren’t consulted at all in this regard because the government has removed municipalities from having any sort of input into the closure of their own schools. The municipality is quite favourable to working with the school board to keep this school open, and what they can do to rent it out at night, perhaps, or utilize it in order to keep it open. So we have the councillors ready to go. There’s the Springfield parents association, which has been created to help fight this situation. I respect those parents who are stepping forward, because they truly believe and the community truly believes that the school should remain open. But, under this government’s mismanagement, that school is set to close.", "New Sarum, in my riding, is set to close as well. New Sarum is almost full. It’s not like it’s a school that’s dwindling down to low numbers. It’s unfortunate that they will close that. There’s a nice little community around there. The kids walk to school; they will now be bused, and who knows how long it will take them to go to wherever they may be?", "They are looking at creating another school in the Belmont area. We need that school built because they’re going to close two other rural schools. Those kids in Westminster and South Dorchester will have the choice. If they don’t build the school in Belmont, those kids will be sent into London to school. Last year, the school board tried to send those kids—because there are no supports for rural schools anymore—to London for school. It was two years ago that the school board tried to send every child taking French immersion who lived west of St. Thomas to Strathroy to school, which is in a whole different county—45 minutes, at the closest range. We fought that.", "So it’s not that this is a new problem going on in our school system where, in rural Ontario, the funding model doesn’t fit what is going on with the urban schools. We’ve asked the government to perhaps take a look at the funding formula to make a change. Bill 70 could have been a great place, with the release of the fall economic statement, to put this in there to help alleviate the pain, but instead, they didn’t.", "My hope, going forward, is that the government allows school boards to work with municipalities and listen to the parents to see how we can keep these schools open, because when you shut down some of these schools in these smaller communities, that’s the end of the community. Schools are community-builders; they can also be community-destroyers, when you shut them down.", "We’ve seen this bill come out, and there has been a lot of discussion ongoing. I went to the briefing the minister put on there, and it was quite interesting, the binder of information they’ve got. There’s so much change going on in this legislation that the binder is so huge, with the information.", "The big topic that this government sold this to the public under was the land transfer act, doubling the tax credit on the land transfer for the refund up to $4,000 for first-time homebuyers. That’s great that they’re doing that because it needs to be done; however, there are so many expenses in people’s lives that probably would have been a better break for them—and more than just people buying new homes. We’re talking about the senior couple living at home.", "Again, this government doesn’t understand. If you live in rural Ontario, the transportation networks aren’t there for these seniors. So these seniors are looking for places to get around. If they’re able to afford their high-priced driving permit, their vehicle licence sticker, which has shot up drastically under this government, and able to afford their energy prices, perhaps they would be able to buy some food, which is also heading up. So taking some of this land transfer tax and giving an extra $2,000 on the refund is great; however, the government is missing the boat on actually helping all Ontarians with regard to this legislation.", "We look forward to further deliberation, and hopefully in the committee we’ll talk more about the changes they’re making to the College of Trades. As you know, Mr. Speaker, this government came out with the College of Trades during the last—well, implemented it after the 2011 election, and the tradespeople—the electricians and the plumbers and the carpenters—were taken aback by the fee increases, the fees that shot through the roof, and the fact of making some trades compulsory. The college backed off but they almost shut down the housing industry trying to make carpenters compulsory trades.", "We’re also looking at numerous other initiatives the government has brought forward in this legislation, but to return to the initial points, people in this province are talking about energy, people in this province are talking about health care, and people in this province are talking about how unaffordable life is under these 13 years of the Kathleen Wynne Liberal government. This bill does nothing to improve their stake in Ontario.", "As an aside, we met on the weekend with a couple who were having trouble with long-term care. Again, this bill could have put in some provisions to actually build new long-term-care beds. This government has built zero new long-term-care beds. They have redone some beds, which is good, but the population is aging and the need for long-term care is expanding, and this government has done nothing in order to create situations to build more new long-term-care beds. They’ve wasted money. We saw earlier today in question period where they spent over a billion dollars to save the Minister of Finance’s seat back in the 2011 election. We’ve seen, as I said earlier, Ornge, eHealth. The amount of money—$300 billion in debt; a billion dollars a month is spent just to service the interest. It doesn’t get anything out of it; it just satisfies our debt. A billion dollars a month is $12 billion a year.", "Of the problems I’ve listed in this speech, that $12 billion a year that this government is flushing down the toilet could very well have fixed these problems. We could take care of our rural schools. We could improve health care. We could help that senior couple living at home manage their expenses so that we didn’t have to skyrocket our fees and services.", "I didn’t scratch the surface of the special purpose account. Again, there are no details on how that special purpose account is spent. Maybe an audit would have been undertaken; maybe they could have added in there that there would be a yearly audit by the Auditor General with regard to where our hunting and fishing licence money goes, because we know that 100% of that money is supposed to go back into fishing and hunting. We’ve already seen from one little report we were able to find after five years that they spent over $50,000 on psychologists.", "I don’t know, Mr. Speaker; it’s quite troubling. Our province is in trouble. The government will tell you they’re building it up but when we really look at it, this government is closing schools and closing hospitals. People are finding it harder and harder with work. We saw today that a greenhouse operator in Leamington is leaving the province because of energy rates. Things have to change. Bill 70 doesn’t address those things that need to change, and I hope the government will make some amendments to this bill." ],

What’s alarming is that they’ve rolled it into this omnibus bill—they’re creating a provision where there is no longer any critical oversight of health and safety in workplaces. What the government wants to do, under Bill 70—again, a finance bill—is make it so that an employer can become accredited and is no longer subject to inspection and scrutiny when it comes to workplace safety.", "What we’ve seen time and time again, far too many times—one time is one time too many—are people who are not only getting seriously injured on the job but people who are dying. What this Liberal government wants to do under this bill is take away the oversight and give responsibility to an employer to do inspections to make sure their workplace is safe. Frankly, Speaker, I don’t think that any worker in the province or the families of the people who have been killed on the job or who have been injured on the job would want to see any less oversight into health and safety.", "We tabled an amendment that would remove schedules 16 and 17 from the bill, and the government said no.

I think that’s really good news that Ontarians should know.", "I wanted to comment on a couple of things that are in Bill 70 that I think will be of interest to my constituents. One of them is some changes in the rules that apply to credit unions and caisses populaires. As you would know, Speaker, Guelph and environs are the heart of the co-operative movement, be it financial co-operatives or ag co-operatives or virtually any kind of co-operative in Ontario. The financial co-operatives, the credit unions, are always of interest in our neck of the woods.", "Minister Albanese, when she was formerly the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance, did some work on this, consulting with the industry. She made a number of recommendations in her report on how we can align our legislation around caisses populaires and credit unions with best practice. Some of those changes that will change the deposit insurance limits to $250,000, permit credit unions to wholly own insurance brokerage subsidiaries, and remove differentiated rules for small credit unions are captured in Bill 70, and I think that’s very good news for the credit unions and for the consumers who use them." ],

It says that the proposed act would dissolve the ORPP administrative corporation and transfer the dissolved corporation’s assets and liabilities to the crown in right of Ontario. It would also repeal provisions in all other Ontario legislation that relate to the corporation.", "When we talk about waste and mismanagement, this is a typical example of exactly how this government operates. They only spent $70 million on this thing, and that’s $70 million that they spent on a corporation that nobody wanted in Ontario, especially people in my riding. They couldn’t believe that they were going to get something else out of their paycheques, which they didn’t want—and yet the government still spent $70 million. That would have went a long way to keeping people’s hydro bills lower, and certainly it would have helped a lot of people pay their hydro bills. Instead, this government spent all this money trying to promote the ORPP and then all of a sudden pulled the plug on it.", "When the member speaks of waste and mismanagement, this is just one of the most perfect examples of how this government does things, where they spend money and spend money and never look at the consequences of their spending." ],

We brought this issue up when this bill was first introduced, and we put forward a reasoned amendment that said that we would be happy to consider this bill if the issues regarding workers and health and safety were put forward in separate bills. We brought that up at the same time this bill was introduced. That slowed the process down for a day or so, which was a good thing because it allowed us to put a bit more focus on this issue.", "There are some good things in this budget bill. There are some bad things, too. The part about credit unions? We agree. Why does this government continually take some good things and continually stick it to the people by putting a poison pill in each one of these bills—in this case, affecting workers’ health and safety in something that’s a budget bill, where they are fairly confident that people are not going to notice and are going to look the other way? Well, on this one, we’re not going to look the other way. We’re proud to defend workers’ health and safety. That’s why we’re bringing forward, in this bill—that part should not be in this bill.

This budget measures act is a classic and frustrating example of an omnibus bill. It has everything in it, including, I suspect, the kitchen sink. At first glance we don’t see it, but I get that sinking feeling when I see this massive piece of legislation, so I’m sure it’s tucked into one of the corners of one of the 26 schedules. However, I’m going to focus primarily on just a few of those schedules rather than touching on all 26.", "All sorts of people in industries are affected by this bill, but they’ve hardly had the time to react. This omnibus truck is being driven through the Legislature at lightning speed. Our research folks, our stakeholders and friends, neighbours and businesses across the province are still trying to wade through the details of this bill, and yet here we are already in this second week of debate. And you know that this government is just going to ram it through debate, will try to get it through committee and get it passed before we rise on December 8.", "Schedule 6 amends the Crown Employees Collective Bargaining Act, which creates a separate corrections bargaining unit, which essentially makes corrections essential, subject to binding arbitration. This schedule reflects the commitment made by the government to OPSEU to create a corrections-only unit.", "Speaker, you may remember that around this time last year we were counting down to a potential strike or lockout that ultimately was averted—not averted, you will recall, without the government throwing millions and millions and millions—I’m losing track; I think at last count it was over $44 million—into pre-strike preparations. Imagine how much better off this system would be if that kind of money was spent on making things safer or better resourced, but I digress.", "It is interesting, though, that this piece of legislation is tucked quietly into a giant omnibus bill. I would have anticipated it would have been a stand-alone piece up for discussion, although really this does make sense because I would imagine this government doesn’t really want to have a fulsome debate on the state of corrections in the province of Ontario. Those conversations tend to make this government look really, really negligent and incompetent, but don’t worry, Speaker; I promise we will have other opportunities to discuss the crisis in corrections in this Legislature.", "Back to the bill: Let’s focus on pension issues for a moment. Schedule 18 is the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Legislation Repeal Act, 2016. It proposes that the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan be dissolved. You know, Speaker, we’ve had a lot of time in this Legislature this session to talk about pensions. Something that I hope was accomplished by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan that didn’t happen was the discussion and debate around retirement security. I hope it helped people to better understand the need to have that financial security in retirement.", "I was very proud as a New Democrat to be part of those conversations about what retirement security should look like and what retirement security that people deserve should look like. I was very glad as the critic to talk about the importance of strong defined benefit plans. I was glad to push this government on those issues to try and make a substantial difference. Ontario deserves strong pensions, and I will continue as critic to strengthen and defend pensions and retirement security in this province.", "So, here we are at the end of the ORPP journey. An interesting and ironic tidbit is that the same day that this act came out was also the same day that the CBC reported that even after the ORPP was cancelled, this government spent $793,000 on more commercials. Speaker, $793,000 would go a long way for those who are dealing with our seniors and those in retirement with unpredictable incomes.", "This government and its priorities make me feel sick to my stomach sometimes, and that’s just one more example, but let’s dive into the next stretch, which I find really, really unsettling.", "This is schedule 16. This schedule amends the Occupational Health and Safety Act to allow the Chief Prevention Officer to accredit a health and safety management system according to standards set out by the Chief Prevention Officer. It will create a system of health and safety accreditation for employers that would remove these employers from being subject to mandatory health and safety inspections. It allows the Chief Prevention Officer to establish standards that a health and safety management system must meet in order to become an accredited health and safety management system.", "Speaker, you might have questions about what an accredited health and safety management system would look like. You might be curious about the standards that health and safety management systems must meet in order to become accredited, but I can’t tell you because those details are left to regulations.", "Labour and injured workers’ advocates have shared with us an email they received from ministry staff coming from the ministry. I’ll share it with you:", "“Businesses who set up a superior example when it comes to health and safety standards and compliance should be rewarded for their efforts, while others should be incentivized to follow their example. This program would recognize employers who implement superior occupational health and safety management systems, highlighting the great work that they are doing to protect Ontario workers and reduce the burden of unnecessary processes such as routine inspections. We would still investigate complaints and incidents.”", "Just to highlight a little bit of that again, “This program would recognize employers ... who reduce the burden of unnecessary processes such as routine inspections.” How on earth are we having a conversation about routine inspections being a burden? Where are we? When is a routine inspection an unnecessary process? What are other unnecessary processes, and why on earth does anyone who works at the ministry think that inspections are a burden or are unnecessary?", "We’ve all heard that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Not today. Not in this bill. The Chief Prevention Officer will be setting standards to circumvent prevention—just let that hang there for a second—basing the system on an after-the-fact, post-event response. Higher fines, they’ll promise. But what on earth are we talking about?", "Any changes to the Occupational Health and Safety Act should be about making workplaces safer. This will not. This will endanger workers, full stop. This should be about prevention. This should be about training. This should be about education. This should be about seeing the benefits of health and safety initiatives. They should be investing in ensuring that more people go to work and go home safely at the end of the day.", "The Ontario Federation of Labour has said, “These proposed amendment go far beyond just giving the government the power to create an accreditation process. Section 7.7 gives the Chief Prevention Officer the power to outsource.” Giving the Chief Prevention Officer the power to outsource could lead to the outsourcing of virtually the whole accreditation recognition process. He can outsource training program approval; he can outsource deciding who is an approved training provider; he can outsource the certification of the joint health and safety committee members; and he can outsource the collection of information about workers who have been trained.", "This opens the door for privatization of workplace health and safety. We know how much this government loves to privatize. They love to privatize without permission, pretend it’s a good idea when it’s pointed out that it’s a mess, and then they apologize. We cannot have health and safety be privatized, mucked up and then apologized for. People will get hurt and then, I’m sorry; no government is going to fix it.", "We want safer workplaces. Expanding power to the Chief Prevention Officer is not going to make workplaces safer. We need field visits and proactive inspections. I can personally comment on surprise inspections. I’ve been through 17 jails—through the front door—across the province. I’ll tell you, I just pop in—as MPPs, we can do that. I appreciate the surprise nature that when I just show up, the employer—in this case, the ministry—doesn’t know that I’m coming. So they don’t have time to paint, they don’t have time to clean, move people or transfer them to different institutions. There’s a real value in seeing the truth, not phoning ahead to avoid it.", "Here’s a point of contrast: When the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services arranges to tour a jail, they roll out the red carpet—figuratively, of course. The ministry makes sure that all will meet with the minister’s approval. I hear that they even painted at OCDC—shiny new paint—and then the tour was so short, incidentally, that he didn’t even get a chance to see it.", "I said it before and I’ll say it again: I challenge him and I challenge the rest of us in this House to check out the correctional facilities in our ridings and put authentic eyes in there. But I don’t think the minister will because, if he sees it, he’ll have to deal with it. This brings us right back to schedule 16 and health and safety.", "I’d like to take a moment and welcome my friend Len Elliott, executive board member and regional vice-president of OPSEU, who is joining us for the debate. Len shared with me some of his insight. He says that Ministry of Labour inspectors have written thousands of orders to contraventions—thousands of health and safety contraventions to which orders are written by health and safety inspectors on proactive field visits. Thousands of violations, thousands of contraventions and thousands of orders—and those visits and those orders might actually be an inconvenience to employers. I say, “Good.” I say that that is being proactive. That is prioritizing health and safety. I say, “Well done, and keep up the great work.” But not Minister Flynn and the Ministry of Labour: They’ve decided to say, “Oh, that’s a burden on employers and needs to stop.”", "Proactive visits lessen the number of critical injuries and fatalities in this province and do reduce health and safety concerns. They’re not unnecessary. They aren’t a burden. They are absolutely necessary and should be happening more often. Any yappy backroom buddies who are running these businesses, who are whining about inconvenience and looking for exemptions, you know what? They should have more visits to determine why they want the inspectors out. It’s so shady.", "The Minister of Labour and his team are pushing for accreditation, and using the term “burden” is shameful language to be using. So let’s paint a picture. The Chief Prevention Officer sets out what standards need to be met in an accredited workplace. They’ll determine how many binders and how many policies need to exist, which papers need to be posted, how many full-time health and safety people need to be on the books.", "The workplaces, by the way, that already have those things today would likely meet these accreditation standards in a heartbeat. But here’s the real truth: Many of the employers that today might meet these standards could still have 200 orders written. They’ve got the binders, the policies and health and safety people. They would likely be accredited, but they still have killed and injured workers.", "There it is. Accreditation is a deal made with big, heavy Ontario employers by this government. It’s shameful, it’s worrisome, and the Ministry of Labour position is that we just don’t understand. You know, if something happens, they want higher fines. Don’t worry. If someone loses an eye, at least they’ll try to get a higher fine. Speaker, that’s not acceptable. What happens after injury or fatality absolutely matters, but it should not challenge actual prevention and proactive safety measures.", "When did Minister Flynn agree to exempt employers from a program that would keep workers safe? I understand the importance of stakeholder input, but the Ministry of Labour seems to be listening only to high-level, influential companies, and guess what? The employees and workers are stakeholders too. The balance of power is and always will be with the employer. That’s why we have the external system—the Ministry of Labour—to come in and check on compliance and check on enforcement of the act. No worker in Ontario has the ability to get things fixed. The employer has that power.", "So workers go to the Ministry of Labour. But you know what? Sometimes, they don’t. They don’t call. They’re afraid to call. They have a very real fear of reprisals. These workers are getting hurt. We just had workers in Windsor lose their lives in the workplace, and here we are, standing and talking about the burden of inspections on inconvenienced employers.", "Ministry of Labour inspectors have the ability to proactively go in to inspect and come out writing orders. This government cannot take this proactive piece out. How dare the Minister of Labour consider any type of legislation that would roll back the times on the Occupational Health and Safety Act? Ironically—and I think this is interesting—when the original Occupational Health and Safety Act was passed, I understand it was also a Bill 70 that created it. Here we have another Bill 70, but instead, we’re talking about removing safeguards, removing levels of prevention and safety precautions.", "Proactive field visits are not a burden. Inspections are not a burden. There are workplaces that have critically injured and killed workers, but they would likely qualify for accreditation. To suggest that increased fines for egregious violations is somehow going to encourage employers to keep workplaces safe is absurd. We can’t hit the emergency—we can, but it’s tantamount to hitting the emergency stop after someone has lost their arm, and that’s too little, too late.", "In 2009, the Dean panel was created to look at the Occupational Health and Safety Act, and something that came out of that report was the creation of the Chief Prevention Officer. Something else is the provincial council. This provincial council, by the way, is not some whimsical thing that labour is imagining; it was Dean’s recommendation. The government agreed, and this provincial council exists. It’s supposed to have the participation of both employer and labour stakeholders. Here we have a hugely consequential amendment, and the provincial council was circumvented. That shouldn’t be allowed to happen.", "A worker a day dies in Ontario, whether from an accident or workplace illness or injury. More than two workers a day die in Canada. If this government wants to talk about burden, let’s talk about the burden of responsibility to keep workers safe. Let’s talk about the burden of loss carried by the family in the wake of tragedy. Let’s talk about the financial burden weighing on a worker who is forced into the WSIB nightmare maze after a workplace injury. Let’s talk about burden. And shame on anyone for being loose and irresponsible with language. A safety inspection is not a burden. Anyone on that team who wants to challenge training, prevention, inspections and safety I think is in the wrong ministry. This legislation is disgusting. So we will move on.", "I know that my colleagues in the NDP are not going to let schedule 16 go, so we’ll have lots of opportunity to talk about it.", "We’ll move on to schedule 17. Schedule 17 doubles down on undermining worker safety in the province. This schedule amends the Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act, 2009. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, or IBEW, shared a legal opinion with us that they sought on this because they saw it as being immensely troubling. The legal opinion stated: The amendments will “devalue skilled trades and put the public at risk by allowing unskilled workers to do the work of a compulsory trade.... [The] bottom line is, big business will benefit from cheap labour costs and the public and workers will be at risk.”", "This is about public safety. Let me put it a clearer way: If I want to check if a skilled tradesperson performing a task is legitimate, I can go on the Ontario College of Trades public registry to search them. Schedule 17 removes the teeth from the Ontario College of Trades’ ability to ensure that the workers installing or performing the tasks of the 22 compulsory trades are registered apprentices or licensed journeypersons in that trade, essentially allowing anyone to perform these tasks and rendering the skills and training of those apprentices and journeypersons meaningless.", "Speaker, would you want someone who wasn’t qualified wiring your children’s school or a community hospital? What about someone with no documented experience working on the brakes of your car? Imagine driving along, looking in your rear-view mirror past your kids in the back seat at the dump truck following you down the 401: Do you really want to wonder who did their brakes? What about the hairstylist who mixes chemicals to dye your hair? I remember a girl I used to work with had a terrible chemical burn on her scalp that she got in a salon. It still hadn’t even started to heal after months. Or what about a tower crane operator in Toronto lifting steel or a load of concrete up 50 floors above traffic, the public and the workers on the job site? Do we want someone unqualified performing this work? I don’t.", "At a time when Ontario and our country has been encouraging youth, women and our indigenous community members to seek out a career in the skilled trades, this Wynne government is trying to take us back decades. They’re devaluing the in-class and on-the-job training that Ontario’s apprentices and journeypersons have accomplished, ultimately putting the public at risk. For what? Who’s going to benefit from this—unscrupulous contractors who will hire unqualified people to perform the tasks of Ontario’s 22 compulsory trades?", "I have no idea why the Liberals are so interested in this. How do they stand to benefit from these changes? Is this another cash-for-access story and Wynne is just paying back her friends? I don’t know.", "Schedule 16 and 17 are extremely problematic and ultimately dangerous. These substantial labour bills should not be a part of a finance omnibus bill. The NDP filed a reasoned amendment to have both schedule 16 and 17 pulled from this bill. The government didn’t support that, but they need to support safety and they need to pull them out of this bill.", "Speaker, this bill is going to pass. I’m going to jump to the end. That’s what’s going to happen. We, however, will not be supporting it. We would not be able to sleep at night if we supported it because Bills 16 and 17 are substantial labour bills that attack health and safety.", "We support health and safety and so we’re never going to support a piece of legislation which is going out of its way to hurt the people of this province.

If done properly, accreditation has the potential to actually improve health and safety by incentivizing companies who, in partnership with labour and employees, do a superior job. It allows the Ministry of Labour to focus resources in other areas to prevent injuries. It allows the Ministry of Labour to focus their energies in those areas where there are more likely to be problems for workers. This actually allows us to protect more workers who are more vulnerable. This is ensuring that we’re using our resources as wisely as possible to protect workers.", "There is no replacement for getting health and safety right in the first place, and we’ll continue to do this. But again, these measures are going to actually help workers and make sure we protect those who are most vulnerable from having their health and safety infringed upon.

Her headline is, “Bootleg Butts Big Business.” In the province of Ontario—I think the convenience stores do this every year. They go around and they collect cigarette butts from different areas of the province, different businesses, municipal offices, to see how many of those cigarette butts are actually illegal cigarettes. In southwestern Ontario where I’m from, the average is 26%. But if you look at some places like Whitby city hall, which is close to the member from Oshawa, 92% of those butts were contraband cigarettes. In Orillia Square Mall, it’s 73%; eastern Ontario, 29.3%; northern Ontario, over 54%. In Sault Ste. Marie, the cabinet minister’s riding, almost 75% of cigarettes are illegal.", "Mr. Speaker, this government has failed utterly when it comes to the tobacco business in the province." ],

Thousands of orders.”", "That piece represents thousands of potential workplace injuries, thousands of potential workplace deaths, thousands of workers who could be so seriously injured, they will never work again and cannot provide for their families—thousands of families who could face not having their loved one because this ministry has stripped oversight and feels that routine safety inspections are a burden.", "I give this to the ministry—to the government—to think about: What kind of a burden is it for an employee who is injured on the job?

We’re combining those two pots of money and creating a completely new OSAP that means that 150,000 students in this province will have access to grants that exceed their tuition. Free tuition for 150,000 students; 250,000 students will be better off after these reforms than they were before.", "This is possible not because we’re putting more money into the system but because we’re getting a lot smarter and a lot more targeted.

This is a ministry that needs to be pretty careful on schedule 16 that it doesn’t undo all of the important work that it has done for years. Talking about our resources more wisely—for goodness’ sakes, the member himself said that there is no replacement for getting health and safety right the first time. There’s also no replacement for the worker who is injured by something that was preventable had there been routine inspections that they’ve decided are unnecessary burdens.

To be able to have an inspection, orders be written on a workplace that looks like it’s safe, looks fine, meets the accreditation standards potentially, has all the binders on a shelf, has all of the posters on the wall—but still there are orders that can be written and lives that can be affected.

Yongehurst Distillery is producing new and interesting products and is one of the small but growing number of Ontario craft distillers. In fact, in 2016, we now have eight times more craft distillers than we had in 2011. I had the opportunity to have a tour of Yongehurst earlier this year, in July, and met its co-owners, Rocco and John-Paul. While touring the distillery, I spoke to them and heard their concerns about how beer and wine were being treated differently in Ontario as opposed to distilled spirits, and what the Ontario government could do to grow the craft spirits industry here.", "After my meeting with Yongehurst, I had the opportunity to share their concerns and the concerns of other craft distillers from around the province with both Minister Sousa and Minister Naqvi. In those conversations, the ministers assured me of our continued commitment to fostering a more innovative and dynamic business environment in Ontario, including for the rapidly growing craft distillery sector.", "That’s why we listened to Ontario distillers and introduced legislation that, if passed, would replace the LCBO markup and commission structure at on-site distillery retail stores. I believe that this legislation is a good step forward in continuing to foster the relationship between the government and Ontario’s craft distillers. This change in the legislation would bring them more into line with how Ontario deals with beer and wine produced in the province.", "Passage of the bill will also expand sales opportunities by allowing craft spirits to deliver directly to bars and restaurants, making it easier for bars and restaurants to develop relationships with craft distillers and grow their businesses. I know that Rocco and John-Paul spoke to me specifically about this issue.", "We have been and will continue to support small producers in the spirits industry and remain committed to supporting the growth and expansion of this emerging sector. But I recognize that Bill 70 is just a first step on the road with Ontario craft distillers and that there is more work to be done.", "If the bill passes second reading, I would encourage stakeholders like the members of the Ontario craft distillers and Yongehurst to participate in the public hearings of the bill.", "I’m proud to stand in support of Bill 70. The legislation is a positive step, albeit a small first step, to be made by the government to support craft distillers, just one facet of a bill that will assuredly build Ontario up.

There is a very determined effort on the part of our government and our Premier, a determined effort that is emphasized in Bill 70, along with a number of other items, because there’s a clear understanding on our part that, for more than a generation, particularly prior to 2003, there was chronic underinvestment in all forms of critical infrastructure in the province.", "I don’t think there’s a member on any side of this Legislature who would disagree with the fact that we have not successfully kept up with the demands. I’m often fond of saying that we have a twin challenge in Ontario, because prior to 2003, we were not investing enough in infrastructure, so we have the simultaneous challenge of having to catch up and also keep up, because our population grows and our infrastructure challenge continues to grow as well. That’s why it is so important for us to be able to move forward with initiatives or legislation like Bill 70.", "I know other members on this side, including the member from Davenport and the Deputy Premier, in discussion just a little bit earlier this afternoon, talked about some of the specific items that are included in the fall economic statement or in Bill 70. But I just want to say that there isn’t a corner of the province that I have the opportunity to go to—and it doesn’t matter whether that corner of the province is held by a government member or by an opposition member. When I meet with municipal leaders and business leaders, when I have the chance to speak to individuals, whether it’s university students, college students—literally, the list is endless, Speaker, and you would know this as well—there is a significant demand to make sure that we continue to make these critical investments.", "I’m also fond, as you would know, Speaker, of listing off all the projects that we are currently involved in, again, whether they’re highway projects or they’re transit projects.

But it really is a multi-faceted accomplishment, I will say, whenever we’re able to strike the right balance. With Bill 70, when we’re talking again about specific highway projects that we’re relating to a number of the other projects that we have undertaken and will continue to undertake, we see that the spin-off benefits are considerable.", "We create jobs, of course, when we make investments in critical infrastructure. We’re fond on this side of the House of talking about the 12-year, $160-billion infrastructure plan. It is the most ambitious, and it is the single largest investment in infrastructure in Ontario’s history, and because I think it’s extremely important to convey this to people, I’m also delighted to know that because of that investment in infrastructure over the next 12 years, we will help to create or sustain 110,000 jobs right across the province.", "I know that in some of the discussion here this afternoon relating to Bill 70, there was a great deal of interest that was recognized—the member from the NDP caucus talking about some of the impacts relating to our skilled tradespeople. I’m not going to delve into that particular item of Bill 70, but I would say we are truly blessed in Ontario to have literally, not just in North America but perhaps right around the world, a global-leading infrastructure and construction sector. And right at the heart of that world-leading construction or infrastructure sector are the skilled tradespeople, the women and men who go to work every single day, who have such a passion for making sure that they not only practise their craft or practise their trade but that they are able to help us build the province up.", "Speaker, when I think of the infrastructure investments that we’re making, I realize that over those next number of years, many Ontario individuals, but even more importantly, many Ontario families, will have more opportunity. They will have more income, a meaningful employment that will last, because we have demonstrated leadership here in Bill 70 and last year’s budget and previous budgets over my time here in this Legislature to make sure that we’re getting this right.", "Here in the greater Toronto and Hamilton area, the list of transit projects that this government is investing in is truly off the charts. We’re currently building, as everyone here would know, I believe, the Eglinton Crosstown. It is the single largest public transit project in Ontario history: a capital cost of $5.3 billion; 19 kilometres of LRT through the middle of the GTA, with approximately nine of those kilometres buried below the city of Toronto; significant connectivity to the GO lines in the area, to the TTC subway stations in the area and to somewhere in the neighbourhood of 54 bus routes. That’s one transit project alone. That doesn’t even take into account the Finch West LRT.", "I know the member from Etobicoke North and the member from York West are both thrilled to know that we are making a $1.2-billion investment in the Finch West LRT. That is a transit project that will run from the new subway station that’s being built as part of the Toronto-York Spadina subway extension, which, in and of itself, is a project that this government is contributing $870 million towards. There is a new subway station that will be built right at the corner—it’s currently under construction—at Keele and Finch. The Finch West LRT will run westbound from that new subway station right at the edge of York University, all the way up to Humber College, going through two priority neighbourhoods. It will connect Humber College to York University, two of Ontario’s leading post-secondary institutions. I know, again, the member from York West and the member from Etobicoke North have shown tremendous leadership on that particular project.", "I could talk about the Hurontario LRT running through Mississauga and the southern tip of Brampton—going from the GO station in the south end, the Port Credit GO station, connecting to other GO stations and ultimately to the gateway at Steeles—or the Hamilton LRT project.", "Those are just three that I could discuss.", "The Viva BRT that runs, of course, along Highway 7 in my home of York region—a $1.4-billion contribution our government is making towards York region’s Viva BRT, which again, in and of itself, connects to multiple other existing transit lines.", "The Union Pearson Express: I’ve heard from members of every single caucus here in the Legislature about how much of a worthwhile experience it has been for them and it is for them to occasionally have the opportunity to take the Union Pearson Express. That is a train that runs 19 and a half hours a day at regular intervals, and it takes 25 minutes to get an individual from Union Station all the way out to the airport. There are hundreds and hundreds of commuters in west-end Toronto, for example, who are using that train. Since we reduced the prices and made it more affordable, they are taking that train in order to get to and from work or to get home again, and they’re just thrilled.", "I point out all of these projects not simply because I’m proud of them—I am proud of them; I think it shows that we are a government that is making tremendous progress on what has been a long-standing challenge for all governments at all levels and of all partisan stripes—but I point this out because there is clear evidence right now, on the ground, in the ground, under way, by way of construction, to demonstrate to the people of this region and to the people of the province that we are making that unprecedented contribution or investment in infrastructure. This is not simply about plans on a drawing board or hope for conceptual ideas that may one day occur. We are actually in the process right now of building that seamless and integrated transit network that the greater Toronto and Hamilton area needs so badly. It needs it badly, again, not simply because of quality-of-life demands that we all have, and I say that as someone who is a life-long resident of the GTHA; it’s also critical for our provincial economy to know that this region can continue to move, and move effectively and efficiently and safely.", "We know there are various reports that peg the cost of gridlock in the greater Toronto and Hamilton area, depending on the source we’re using, at anywhere from $6 billion to $10 billion annually in lost economic productivity. That’s a challenge that cannot go unmet. That’s why we’re making these investments—investments that are contained, in many respects, in Bill 70 and in previous budgets that this government has introduced.", "When I move beyond the greater Toronto and Hamilton area—earlier, I referenced the transit projects that we are currently supporting in Waterloo region, the ION LRT. I think of Ottawa’s Confederation Line, the LRT that’s currently under construction in the city of Ottawa. Not that long ago, the Premier was in Ottawa along with all of our Ottawa caucus members to announce that the provincial government was confirming its phase 2 funding for the Ottawa LRT. That’s an enormous investment that we’re making in our country’s capital. Again, it’s so critical with respect to that region’s economy and to the quality of life for the people who live in Ottawa and around Ottawa.", "We’ve also taken the extra step beyond the original scope of phase 2 for the LRT. We’ve also agreed to fund 50% of two extensions, one out to Trim Road in the riding of Ottawa–Orléans and one out to the Ottawa airport. I know that the member from Ottawa–Orléans and the member from Ottawa South have both been—in fact, the member from Ottawa–Orléans is also the Minister of Government and Consumer Services. They have both been champions and staunch advocates to make sure that we were able to get it right with respect to that investment.", "I’ve spent some time over the last number of months in northern Ontario. We have such an enormous and beautiful, majestic province that we are all very proud of, I know. In many of those communities, when they think of transit, when they think of transporting themselves, they of course are talking about making sure that we’re able to have the highway infrastructure that connects communities and can also be an important economic link. So again, whether it’s the four-laning of Highway 69, completing that project, which has been under way for a number of years—I know the Minister of Energy and, frankly, I would say, the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka are delighted to know that we continue to make progress on a project that has been sizable and has actually unlocked a ton of potential in that wonderful part of our province, and that work is ongoing. The four-laning of important segments of Highway 11/17—there’s so much more work that we have already completed in that regard, but there is more work still to be done. There is no doubt that we’ll continue to work with our municipal partners and our indigenous peoples to make sure that we are in the best position possible to go forward.", "Speaker, I could literally spend all afternoon talking about the highway projects, the transit projects. I didn’t even have the chance to really reference, at least not till this point, the work we’re doing around modernizing and updating the ferry system in eastern Ontario. I had the chance a number of months ago to go out to Wolfe Island with the member from Kingston and the Islands to do a town hall with people on that island, in that community, to hear in a very compelling and direct way from those individuals about how critical it is for us to get it right with respect to the ferries, and how we need to build in more redundancy and build in more capability to that network. That’s something that we’re involved in.", "Again, I could talk about this endlessly, as all of my colleagues would know all too well. I would say even in the last number of days, I’ve heard questions in this House from members from both opposition caucuses. Just the other day, I took a question from the member from Prince Edward–Hastings, who wanted to know about County Road 49 and the meetings that I’ve had with, for example, the mayor from Prince Edward county. In the past, I’ve taken questions from members of the NDP caucus, whether it’s about four-laning highways in the north or making sure that we’re providing southwestern Ontario with the investment it needs for its critical highway links.", "I would say that Bill 70 and budgets that are still to come here in this Legislature provide every member of the opposition with the ideal opportunity to put crass politics aside, to look beyond their partisan stripes, to recognize that you can’t, on the one hand, ask a question about the need for more infrastructure and on the other hand, continue year after year, month after month, to try to cut the legs out from underneath a government and a Premier that understands exactly how to get this right. So whether we’re talking about Bill 70, whether we’re talking about budgets still to come, I would sincerely hope that members in the PC and NDP caucus would put their money where their mouth is, vote with us and help us build Ontario up for everyone." ],

The Ontario Association of Food Banks notes that rising hydro rates have had a direct and devastating impact on people who live in this province who have to, really, every day face that difficult choice: “Do we heat our home or do we buy food for our children?” Food banks are seeing more and more people who are having to come to access emergency food supplies because they simply cannot afford to pay their hydro bills.", "In London, we know that there were 4,000 Londoners who defaulted, who were simply unable to pay their hydro bills last year, and the number of people in arrears rose by 1,400. There are now 12,400 people who are in arrears on their hydro bills, and that is likely to increase even more, especially now as we go into the winter season.

I know the government says that this is an improvement on the tax rate that they were paying before, but I’m still incredulous that anybody can even survive paying those high tax rates.", "The other part of this bill that I wanted to briefly talk about was the ORPP and the Ontario registered pension plan repeal act, and note that the government spent some $800,000 after they decided to end the Ontario registered pension plan. They still went ahead and spent $800,000 advertising a plan that they weren’t planning on doing.", "I note, in the Toronto Sun, that “Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk commented that the ads were ‘self-congratulatory.’ She noted they would not have been approved under an old law, which gave the Auditor General power to review government advertising for partisan content.” The only problem is, the government changed the law so that they could do partisan advertising." ],

Who wouldn’t vote for that?", "But if I go back to the Green Energy Act and wind turbines, if you look past the glossy photo and actually look at the detail of the 20-year or 50-year or inevitable never-ending story of this, it really starts to make you frightened.", "Bill 70 is omnibus legislation that seeks to amend 27 statutes, enact four new ones and repeal three others. Every failed policy decision—or what Premier Wynne prefers to call “a mistake”—the Wynne Liberals have made over the last 13 years has made life harder and more unaffordable for Ontarians. No fall economic statement is going to change that.", "The government’s omnibus legislation is simply a distraction tactic and has nothing to do with the province’s true financial state. The facts remain: Ontario is in a dire fiscal state and life remains unaffordable under this Liberal government.", "The Wynne Liberals have no plan to get our books back on track that doesn’t involve higher taxes, fees or hydro rates, more fire sales of government assets or cuts to front-line services. The fact that there was barely a mention of hydro rates in the government’s fall economic statement shows just how out of touch this Premier and her government are. Albeit the Premier shared a mea culpa—“I made a mistake”—in regard to the hydro file under her watch, I see nothing in here, Mr. Speaker, that says what significant action they’re going to do.", "If the Premier was sincere in admitting a mistake, her fall economic statement would have provided a frank and honest assessment of the reality of our province’s dire fiscal state. Most importantly, she would have said what she would do to make amends for her mistake, what actions she is taking to make amends to the many people who have suffered socially and economically because of her ideological agenda.", "At minimum, she would have been honest with the people, put their needs first and issued an apology for her colossal mistake in selling Hydro One and a directive that she would abandon the fire sale of this asset that belongs to the people of Ontario, not to the Liberal Party as a game piece to maintain their grip on power.", "If Premier Wynne was sincere, they—especially as the self-declared education party and herself a former trustee and Minister of Education—would have actually disclosed in there that they were closing 600 schools across our province.", "Furthermore, if she was sincere, she would admit that her decision to double our province’s debt over the past 13 years—to a whopping $330 billion—and burden the next generation—and the pages in front of you, Mr. Speaker, sadly—was a mistake. Her fall statement would have advised what she and her government were going to do to address their spending addiction and how they were going to make life more affordable for Ontarians.", "I’m going to speak a little bit on some of the aspects. There are too many to get everything in in 20 minutes, so I’ve picked a few that are pertinent to all Ontarians and certainly to my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound.", "On Alcohol and Gaming Regulation and Public Protection Act changes, this bill would allow the Liberal government to do what it does best: hike taxes. Bill 70 will impose a phased increase to the basic tax rate on wine and wine coolers purchased from wine boutiques and wine retail stores. This means that as of July 1, 2017, spirits from stores operated by a spirits manufacturer would be subject to a basic tax of 61.5% of retail price; a volume tax of 28 cents per litre for spirits coolers and 38 cents per litre for spirits; and an environmental tax of 8.93 cents for each non-refillable container.", "I think the government missed an opportunity with the changes in Bill 70. Perhaps the people of Ontario will deem it another mistake. This bill was a chance for them to fix the gaming act by increasing the limit on raffle table prizes from $500 to $10,000 or even more. These are raffles that are run by charity groups such as hospital auxiliaries and foundations, Royal Canadian Legions, daycare centres and service clubs across our great province. These groups, despite having a long and excellent record of raising money for activities that help to enhance the lives of all Ontarians, from health care and youth sports to arts and culture, are finding it harder and harder to operate under the act’s archaic raffle limits. The limits were set in the 1970s and have never been adjusted to today’s inflation rate. If left status quo, then our charities will keep running afoul of the AGCO rules.", "This is certainly a problem in rural communities where volunteers work hard to raise money and fill gaps left by the government. I’ve heard from many organizations about their concerns with the province’s archaic charity gaming rules. They impede the volunteers’ efforts to raise necessary funds and recruit new members. Sadly, we’re losing valued members, volunteers, because of these mistakes. Unlike in urban regions where, as evidence suggests, voluntary sectors fare best thanks to steady and stable private sector funding and higher private donations, small towns in rural and northern Ontario rely on such things as penny tables and penny auction raffles that are capped at $500. With growing shortfalls in government funding, there is increased stress on communities to keep filling the gaps; for example, a new MRI for a local hospital, new toys and books for a daycare centre, a rejuvenated cenotaph for those who served in Her Majesty’s forces.", "Again, current rules fall short of meeting the needs of communities today. I believe the government should have jumped on the opportunity to increase this maximum prize for raffles to $10,000 as a minimum from $500, to not only better reflect today’s realities but also help ensure the regulation of charitable gaming is competitive and honest and ensure volunteers are efficient in their fundraising efforts. Our volunteer sector, which is made up of many, many of our proud seniors, would have very much lauded this effort.", "On land transfer tax changes, this change does nothing to fix housing affordability in the province. It is simply a distraction tactic.", "This government has caused hydro rates to skyrocket—a mistake, Mr. Speaker—and allowed bureaucratic costs to push up the cost of housing in Ontario. As we said before, at best, all this government wants to do is offer Band-Aid solutions.", "If the Liberals sincerely want to address the cost of housing in Ontario, they need to start with their own unaffordable policies: affordable policies in hydro, for one. It is something that 10 Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound families whose hydro was disconnected last week would have embraced. Life for most—I believe even the member from Davenport admitted that people in her riding are suggesting life is harder for them currently today.", "If the Liberals sincerely want to address the cost of this, then they need to change some of the direction they’re going. Life is harder. We all, I think, have to admit that. That’s certainly what I hear when I’m out in the riding, when I’m out across the province. When I’m in this building, I hear life is harder under this Liberal government. Whether it’s soaring energy rates or more cuts to health care services, the Liberal government is making it harder for Ontario families to live and to buy a home, and for businesses to compete.", "There is one in there, Mr. Speaker, that they do have and that is a good thing, as I certainly heard from the realtors last week: The refund for first-time homebuyers has gone from $2,000 to $4,000. That’s a good-news story for a first-time homebuyer, but it’s not going to offset when their hydro costs are going to go up 40% and continue to escalate. Many people’s hydro bills are as big as their mortgage payments.", "On the municipal affairs act: The changes in the Municipal Act will require all regional chairs to be directly elected, but specifically we would have liked to see something in here about the Green Energy Act—again, a huge mistake, taking democracy away from the closest level of government to the people. This is something we’ve been talking about in the five years I’ve been here. There was a huge opportunity here. If they truly wanted to build Ontario up and give the voice back to the people we are all democratically elected to represent, they could have made a change like that. Instead, they’re tinkering with things like regions. A number of regions have chosen to change to direct election of the chair, including Halton, Waterloo and Durham. The other regions have all reviewed options, and as recently as February 2016, York regional council voted 14-5 against making the change.", "On the same day that this bill was introduced, the Minister of Municipal Affairs introduced an omnibus municipal affairs bill, Bill 68, that actually makes changes to some of the same sections of the Municipal Act. In fact, if the municipal affairs bill passes first, this bill will end up repealing some of those amendments.", "While we support steps towards increasing democracy, we have concerns that this change is being forced with little or no consultation. This is very ominous and reminds us of the way the government overrode the rights of municipal councils and local citizens when it rammed through, as I referenced a few seconds ago, the Green Energy Act.", "Sadly, Mr. Speaker, despite many, many people across the province mentioning this, referencing it to the government, letters through my office and those of many of my colleagues and, I trust, the NDP caucus—and I would think maybe even some of the Liberal backbenchers might have had some of the same types of requests. We want to return democracy, and they could have done that—another opportunity and a huge mistake to not have addressed that and shown the people of Ontario that they truly were listening. And it would have helped our financial and economic situation.", "On Insurance Act changes: Currently, the act provides that the Lieutenant Governor in Council may assess automobile insurers for the expenses and the expenditures of the Licence Appeal Tribunal relating to the resolution of statutory accident benefits disputes. Insurers must pay the amount assessed against them or will have their licence cancelled or suspended. The proposed amendment would provide that any unpaid amount is also a debt due to the crown which may be recovered by action or any other procedure available to the crown.", "This is yet another botched file by the Liberal government, or, as the Premier would use her term, “a mistake.” When we’re talking mistakes—and I note the third party also likes to wade into some of this stuff. Certainly a big mistake: voting for the 2012 McGuinty-Wynne Liberals and allowing them to stay in power, which has resulted in many of the things we’re talking about today and the mistakes that have continued to be made—so a big, colossal mistake on behalf of the third party.", "Even after three years, they are still nowhere close to meeting their promise of rolling back auto insurance rates by 15%. The Liberals’ stretch goal has turned into a failed goal, or, as I would suggest, a mistake. Together with the recent increase in licence plate sticker fees, this is nothing but an added cost for Ontarians. It’s clear that life’s more unaffordable under the Wynne Liberal government.", "On revenue act changes: I’m going back a little bit. I remember that when Premier McGuinty campaigned, one of the first things he said was, “I will not raise taxes.” We had the most unprecedented, biggest tax hike—the health tax—in the province’s history. I would suggest to you that it’s not a revenue problem that the Liberal government has, it’s actually a spending problem.", "A new section in this act is proposed to enable to the Minister of Finance to collect business information from other ministries and public bodies for the purpose of administering and enforcing tax laws and in order to conduct related policy, statistical and risk analyses. This government is taking in record revenues, yet spending continues to be out of control. The Hydro One fire sale, a colossal mistake that we may never recover from, is all about new revenue for the Liberals’ crushing deficit and out-of-control spending, a short-term fix that even the fiscal accountability officer is challenging and saying is very short-sighted and will result in structural deficits for many, many years. We can’t just pad one budget because we made a promise and try to get there. What’s that forsaking for the rest of our history?", "Ontario’s provincial government finances are a mess because of 13 years of Liberal waste, mismanagement, scandal and, yes, mistakes. This government has run eight consecutive budget deficits, a string of mistakes. It has racked up $302 billion in debt, the highest debt in the country, an unconscionable mistake for today’s taxpayers and future generations for decades to come. The debt servicing costs $11 billion in lost tax dollars every year. The payments to service the debt are the third-largest expenditure and the fastest-growing expense in government. It’s money not spent on critical and core public services, such as health care and education.", "Speaker, you would have thought, in a financial statement, in an economic statement, that those types of things would have been addressed, that they would have truly shared and been accountable and transparent with the taxpayers of Ontario. Each $1 billion of it equals the loss of one year of long-term care for 17,000 seniors; one year of home care for 55,000 people; 3,550 palliative care beds for one year; 8,000 new affordable housing units; $260 a month for one year for each ODSP recipient; or one year of free tuition for 2,000 students and 10,000 new school playgrounds.", "I ask the government: How can you defend the mistakes made by your Premier and the suffering of the people impacted above? Will each member admit to their constituents—who trusted them to do what is best for all Ontarians and put the needs of Ontario ahead of theirs, the Premier and the Liberal Party clinging to power—that they made a mistake voting for mistakes like selling Hydro One? I didn’t hear that in the economic statement.", "On the Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act changes: It was a mistake not to create legislation that would promote and support trade workers for the future rather than another bureaucracy and a cash grab. That’s what they could have done when they started the Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act changes. This schedule would alter certain roles of the college. Specifically, the college would cease to determine whether a trade is compulsory. Instead, the minister will now have the power to determine the classification of a trade, which was formerly the college’s responsibility.

New provisions would authorize notice of contraventions to be issued and require the payment of AMPs to the consolidated revenue funds. The College of Trades Appointments Council would be continued but renamed the College of Trades Appointments Council and Classification Roster.", "Mr. Speaker, like you, I trust, I am opposed to more fees and administration that do nothing for the tradespeople who are already stifled by overregulation—another colossal mistake. I believe we need less red tape and more opportunities for new workers. Ontario desperately needs a plan to fix its critical shortage of skilled tradespeople. I’m not certain that this piece of legislation is going to do that. Sadly, the Liberal policies have only worsened the looming skilled-trade shortage in Ontario—a huge mistake.", "On the Pension Benefits Act changes: Again, I get nervous when I hear that this out-of-touch Liberal government wants to meddle in pensions.

We all know that high electricity costs is the biggest issue for most of our constituents, but the question is, now what?

She didn’t come out and say, “I’m not going to close 600 schools despite being a trustee and a former Minister of Education.” She’s going to decimate rural Ontario with 600 school closures.", "My colleague from Oshawa talked about missed opportunities, and she’s bang on. There was no significant action in most of the things in that statement that are truly going to make life significantly different for the people of Ontario.

I was not expecting to debate this particular piece of legislation at this point in time, but I’m delighted to do so, because it’s a piece of legislation that I have asked our various ministers to bring in for a period of time and one which I suspect has the support of all three parties. We’ll see when the vote takes place, but I would think that all the parties would be in favour of this kind of consumer protection.", "This deals with what we have all confronted as individual members of the Legislature, and that is people going door to door and badgering or bullying or persuading, using interesting tactics, people to sign contracts which they really didn’t want to sign. Now, one of the things we want to do is ensure that there were rules in place that this wouldn’t happen.", "One of the challenges we’ve had is that every time we take some action, the people who are responsible for going door to door and persuading people to buy things they didn’t want seem to find a new wrinkle or a new foot in the door, so to speak. Now, it’s particularly cases where there are vulnerable seniors. Many people who are senior citizens in our society are very trusting people. Over the years, they have been used to people perhaps coming door to door years ago selling encyclopedias or perhaps vacuum cleaners and things of that nature. The tactics that were used then were far different than what we see today.", "We find now that people want people to purchase new furnaces, new water heating systems, new air conditioners, and they persuade people that they’re somehow going to save money by making the purchase that they are trying to persuade them to make. Unfortunately, many of the people regret signing a contract or agreeing to a contract. Therefore, cooling-off periods have been very, very helpful. The ability not to have a contract actually signed at the door when somebody comes to the door is one of the things that has been proposed. Often the complaints we receive aren’t from the people themselves, but from members of their family, who, when they find out what has been signed and what the implications are financially, have then contacted our constituency offices to ask how they can get out of these contracts.", "There are have been television programs. I’m going to suggest programs such as W5 on CTV and Marketplace on CBC as a couple of those—and I know Global has had some coverage of this as well—that have pointed out the great difficulty confronting people who are being bullied at the door. People will show up with what they say is government identification. The former minister is entering the House at the present time, and he’s well aware of this and was initiating certain actions when he had that responsibility, and the new minister now is following up with even further action. But we know these people would be very persuasive. Once they got the name on a contract, it was difficult to get out of the contract. I think that all of us in this House are very sympathetic to those people.", "Does that mean we want to block any sales forever of anything? No. But it does mean that certain tough rules have to be put in place, so that we do not have that happening, particularly to vulnerable citizens in our society, costing them hundreds or thousands of dollars more than they would have anticipated or more than they would have money to spend.", "The second is home inspectors. Nowadays, people want to have a home inspected when they are purchasing it and, sometimes, people who are selling want to have a home inspector in to be able to certify that the house they’re selling is in good shape. Home inspectors themselves—because the right-wing talk show hosts, as soon as this happens, of course, immediately say, “Oh, that’s the Liberal government wanting to put more rules and regulations in place. Isn’t it awful?” Of course, they forget when they find out later that, in fact, it was the home inspectors themselves who wanted to see a regime put in place to ensure that they are regulated appropriately, so that they have the qualifications and the credibility as individuals who do home inspections to carry out the responsibilities.", "It’s good for the consumer, it’s good for the homeowners and it’s good, of course, for the home inspectors themselves. There are a lot of very legitimate people out there who are in this business. They know what they’re doing and they know what to look for. They’re very helpful to prospective homebuyers and to those who are selling houses by providing information on everything that would be relevant to a home sale taking place.", "Of course, also in this consumer protection bill, we’re dealing with the people who have payday loans. I remember driving down a main street in Hamilton and, within two blocks, there had to be about five of these places in business, all of them trying to lure people in who were in a very vulnerable position because they needed money and couldn’t easily get it from, say, a bank or a credit union. Even though credit unions recently have endeavoured to help as many people as possible in this situation, there are those who are not credit-worthy enough to be able to do this, and they’re in desperate circumstances. What they don’t realize is what kind of provisions there are when they make the purchase—I’ll call it the purchase—of that loan. Now, there are some people who would say, “Why don’t you put them all out of business?” There’s a certain attractiveness to that, because they do prey upon the most vulnerable people, financially speaking.", "We probably all have a credit bureau within our community or nearby that gives good advice. I always advise people who are in those circumstances and call our constituency office, “Please consult with a credit counselling service in the community,” because those individuals are there to tell people how they might obtain some money without it costing them all kinds of money in interest, or how they might rearrange their finances to be able to be very viable.", "I look at the changes that the minister has proposed. In this case, I think they’re attractive to many people in this House. Some good suggestions have really come from all sides of the House. I have to pay particular tribute to my colleague from Etobicoke Centre, who brought forward a private member’s bill that I think prompted some of this legislation, and he certainly deserves a great deal of credit.", "To be fair, I think people from all sides of this House have encountered what I have as an individual constituency person, and have said that there are ways we can protect the consumer. You never want to go overboard on this, and I don’t think this bill does that. You want to ensure that you cover all of the bases. We’re always interested in any amendments that might come forward that, as a result of the bill being presented and people talking about it, it can be improved. If it can be, the government is prepared to accept amendments, but only if those amendments are going to, in fact, improve the legislation and not be counter to the intent of the legislation.", "I pay tribute to both Ministers of Consumer Services, the member for Sault Ste. Marie and the member for Ottawa–Orléans, both of whom have made this effort. They’ve consulted with people in the field. The members of the public service who work in those ministries have been providing advice, both the Ministry of the Attorney General and the ministry of consumer services—consumer and business services, as we call it today.", "I think, as a result, we’ll have a good bill here that, if accepted by the House—and I look across at another member for Ottawa who I think would be very supportive of this. This morning, she had on a shirt which was the Ottawa Redblacks. I want to take this opportunity, with the forbearance of the Speaker, to congratulate the Ottawa Redblacks on their victory in the Grey Cup. I know there were people from the West who were hopeful, because of the record during the season, that Calgary would win. We always thank them for participating, but we wanted to see the Redblacks win. As a renewed franchise, for instance, it’s been very good. They haven’t won since the 1970s—I think 1976?" ],

That’s a serious problem and it’s a serious issue in this province, and the government has an opportunity here to do something. What is their big action? Their action is to delegate authority to do something to the municipalities. That’s their big action on this file.", "When people have been talking about how payday loan companies exploit the poor, how they put people in a very difficult position—they take people who are already hard off and make it even worse. This government’s solution to the problem is just to say, “Okay, municipalities, you can go and regulate that.” That is passing the buck; that is not dealing with the problem.", "What we need to see in this piece of legislation is a hard cap on the amount of interest that these payday loan companies can charge. We need to see a commitment to creating accessible and affordable credit so that low-income people don’t rely on these exorbitantly high interest rates that are charged by payday loan companies.", "In another area, this bill is taking a step in the right direction, but we want to ensure that it’s not just incremental steps again and again. Where it comes to door-to-door sales, this government took an initiative to address this problem when it came to water heaters and furnaces, but they left open a whole host of other areas. So I ask the government: In this implementation, in this bill, let’s make sure we address the key problem, which is high-interest, long-term contracts that people get locked into for services at the door. Let’s make sure the bill covers a wide host of scenarios, so that it’s not the case that certain areas are covered but then, months later or years later, we see that there’s another area that has been left unaddressed." ],

When I started holding the meetings, I started to hear from seniors about the issues that are important to them. I heard about issues that you would expect to hear about. I heard about pocketbook issues, I heard about health care, I heard about housing and a range of other issues. But what I was surprised to hear was how often those seniors had experienced, or knew someone who had experienced, being taken advantage of at the door by a door-to-door salesperson. More often than not, the products that they were selling were furnaces, air conditioners, water heaters and water treatment devices.", "To me, it is beyond reprehensible that there are businesses, that there are people who make a living, who have a business model based on taking advantage of vulnerable consumers.", "That’s why I introduced a private member’s bill to ban the door-to-door sale of furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners and water treatment devices. That’s why I’m so proud to stand here today, because our government has taken up this piece of legislation and has included in this piece of legislation—which protects consumers in a number of areas—provisions that would ban the unsolicited door-to-door sale of certain products, like the ones I’ve mentioned. It also regulates the home inspection industry and strengthens consumer financial protection.", "These are the kinds of things that are important to the people of Ontario, but they’re particularly important to the people and particularly the seniors in my riding of Etobicoke Centre, who need to know that they will be protected when they buy products that we all use every single day." ],

Nepean is home to a community called Barrhaven, where we are fast growing in terms of housing developments. We are always in constant awe of the development that is occurring in our community. I think it’s really important that we have reliable home inspection professionals so that consumers across the province, new homeowners, before they make their largest purchase, will have a credible, reliable home inspector.", "Right now, at the present moment, there are no province-wide certifications or professional standards for home inspectors, or any recourse, for that matter, for a consumer whose home is revealed to be in need of major work following a purchase. I think, when I look at the communities that I represent, this is important for them, whether it’s a new home that they are buying or a home that has been generously loved by a previous family.", "The government, of course, commissioned a consultation on home inspections that recommended licensing the profession. We are pleased in the Progressive Conservative caucus that the government has taken some of Mr. McDonell’s advice and begun integrating independent officer oversight and salary disclosures into legislation, in compliance with the sunshine list. We’d prefer, obviously, that other independent officers beyond the Auditor General oversee the authority, such as the Ombudsman, but these points can no longer be integrated due to the committee’s procedural rules.", "Stakeholders such as the Ontario home inspectors and real estate professionals have already voiced their support of this initiative. I think that’s incredibly critical. If you have a major organization like the Ontario Real Estate Association coming out in support of these home inspections, I think that is a step in the right direction and it’s one that we certainly listen to.", "I worked with OREA many times throughout my career and, in fact, have tabled a piece of legislation on a number of occasions dealing with illegal grow-ops and clandestine drug operations because, as you probably are aware, in different parts of Ontario, my community included, there have been homes that have been abused by renters or even owners who have used those for illegal drug operations, and in some cases these are very dangerous to communities. In every case, they are illegal, and there is no recourse for the future buyer or for the current homeowner that may be leasing or renting that facility to recover anything. So it’s important that we have home inspectors that are fully licensed, reliable and credible to our consumers in the province of Ontario.", "The Ontario Association of Home Inspectors has experience; they have expertise in coordinating professional standards and education on a voluntary basis. The authority, if it is not synonymous with OAHI, must draw on this pool of knowledge. I think it’s incredible that we are now formalizing this within this legislative context in order for us to better protect consumers in the province of Ontario when they are purchasing a home or they have rented out that home, and that it provides them with some recourse.", "I’m not going to get too into detail with door-to-door sales, collections or payday lending. Many of the others will have an opportunity. I have a limited amount of time, Speaker. But I did want to point out that I was once a Girl Guide and I am the mother now of a graduated Girl Guide. I must say, I have gone door to door many a time, not just to door-knock in a campaign to try to get myself elected but to actually go door to door to sell Girl Guide cookies. Last year, when she finished, I realized I had a case of these in the trunk of my minivan. People love Girl Guide cookies but they didn’t want to take two or three boxes at a time, and I wasn’t prepared to go door to door to sell them, Speaker, because I frankly didn’t have that much time and they were a little bit out of date. Thankfully, my faithful assistant Kayla Fernet did take those cookies and now, whenever she has people visiting her home, she’s able to give those cookies out. That’s obviously very important.", "When I look at the rest of this bill, looking at, for example, door-to-door sales, which is a direct-selling industry of $2 billion annually in Canada that employs thousands of law-abiding salespeople who care about their customers, it’s us trying to deal with those bad actors in the system. And they may not be deterred by new regulation. They could be continuing to go after vulnerable consumers. That’s why it’s important for the ministry to take its duty to educate and reach out very seriously.", "In terms of collections, this industry must have a rock-solid consumer protection provision and strong enforcement to deter wrongdoing.", "Finally, with payday lending, it is a last resort, as one of my colleagues had stated earlier, and it’s one where we must ensure that people understand through their own financial education and awareness that it is probably more difficult than they may think once they’re involved in it. I think that’s why it’s important for us to reduce problem access for consumers so that they’re seeking more legitimate types to assist them.", "I know, Speaker—and I’ll speak to this in my closing remarks—times are tough and people are vulnerable.

One of the concerns we have is, are we really addressing why they need it? What I see and what I’ve heard a lot in my riding and across the province is that people, sadly, are needing more and more of those services because of their inability to pay their bills, particularly their hydro bills. The Minister of Energy stood in the House this morning and was almost proud that there were 300,000 people on a list to get energy assistance in the form of government programs. I would hope that they’d actually be more proud of trying to get that list wiped out so they don’t have anybody having to put their hand out looking for assistance, and taking away the stress. Cold weather is coming. The Christmas season is coming. People need to see some relief on their hydro bills and the ability for them to live a better life.", "The other thing that I certainly have heard—people have come to me to say that one of the biggest door-to-door issues they have is something like when a politician knocks on the door and doesn’t talk about the big things, like selling Hydro One, for example. What are they going to do about those door-to-door salespeople? It wasn’t even in the discussion when we campaigned in 2014. It wasn’t even brought to light. And now they’re going to actually sell that asset, which results in even more people needing relief, more people needing payday loans, because they are saying, “Can I can afford food or can I afford my heat?”", "Interjections." ],

It’s a big mouthful, but it covers three main areas.", "The first one is home inspections. I think a lot of people in Ontario probably didn’t know that home inspectors right now aren’t regulated. I have a confession to make: I didn’t know that before this act was brought in. I think it’s a good thing that this industry is being regulated.", "There are a lot of good home inspectors out there, but there’s no real bar, except a voluntary one. That’s a problem, especially when you consider that buying a home is probably the biggest investment of many people’s lives. They need to be reassured that this home is actually what it is shown to be.", "Sometimes houses can fool you, Speaker. I’ll give you a couple of examples. We’ve bought and sold several houses, my wife and I, but usually they came with farms. We weren’t as concerned with the house as we were with the farm. We lived in this house for a while. It was a nice house on the outside. It’s still a nice house. I was busy in the field, and we were going to put a door in it, an extra door, a patio door. I told Ria she could knock out the drywall and then she’d find studs and insulation. I’d come back and I’d put a header in, and we could get somebody to do the work to put in a door.", "She knocked out the drywall and then she came to the field with the truck. She said, “John, what you told me was going to be there wasn’t there.” She took over in the field and I went to look, and there were boards. I cut the boards away, and then there were beams. It turned out that we lived in a log home, but we didn’t know. It turned out that log home was built—we had a huge fire in 1922 in Timiskaming where several people died, thousands of acres were burned and several towns burned, and that house was built right after the fire. The whole house is built with three-by-sevens—the roof, the walls, the interior walls, everything. I never knew that but we found that out; the first couple of winters that was a very cold house. But we never would have known that. If someone was just buying that house for a home, they maybe would have had second thoughts that it was a log house. I’m not sure a home inspector would have actually caught that. That’s a point.", "I know of another home—and I never asked permission to use the person’s name so I’m not going to use it, but I’m going to use the story. He went to purchase a home. It was 17 years old but a beautiful home. He bought it and he noticed a little while after that right by the chimney, the roof seemed to be failing a little bit. I think it was a leak. He thought, “I’ll just go up and tar the roof.” He walked on the roof and he noticed that there was much more going on than what he thought. It turned out that, somehow, how it had been built, dry rot had set in and all the walls had to be replaced and the first four feet of the trusses. It was a $100,000 bill. I hope that a home inspector would have caught that. That’s truly where a home inspector is worth their weight in gold.", "The last house I purchased, where I now live, is the first house that we ever bought for a house.

I remember when we first got elected—I was elected at the same time as the member from Kenora–Rainy River. I know that in our neck of the woods, her part of northern Ontario and my part of northern Ontario, we spent a lot of time fighting door-to-door sales on energy contracts.

I’m sure that it’s happening to other people too.", "Again, it’s incumbent on us to make sure that we put guidelines in place—I was going to say “roadblocks”; maybe “roadblocks” is better, because people will try to go around it. But it’s incumbent on us to make sure that we identify a problem like that, and door-to-door sales are a problem.

Because unless you woke up at 6 o’clock that morning wanting a new water heater, and if somebody comes at 11 o’clock, saying, “You need a water heater”—if you didn’t think of that at 6 o’clock this morning, maybe you should hold the phone." ],

It can cost as much as $100,000, if it’s as significant a flaw as he described.", "That’s why home inspections have become even more important today than they ever were. Having people who are well-qualified, as he points out, who know what they’re doing, who have the training, who have the experience and who have the trust of both the buyer and seller is exceedingly important. This bill goes a long way to address that.", "There are suggestions with other parts of the bill that we simply ban anything door-to-door. I don’t think that we could probably constitutionally get away with that.

That probably impacts the amount you’re paying on your mortgage and probably does suffocate the odd real estate sale as well.", "Presently in Ontario, a first-time homebuyer with a rebate will get about $2,000 back.

I would recommend to any consumer who’s buying a house that they get people in qualified trades, if they know anybody or find somebody, and have them just go over it and take a look before the building inspector comes so that they can do comparative analysis to make sure that the qualified building inspector—which he doesn’t have to be nowadays—would be able to catch it." ],

I started to hear from seniors who had been the victims of aggressive, misleading and coercive sales tactics at their doors, or who knew someone who had been the victim of aggressive, misleading and coercive sales tactics at the door.", "One constituent pulled me aside at the end of a meeting and said, “You know, all these issues we’ve been talking about”—because we talked about a range of them—“like health care, like education, like the environment, like transit, transportation—these are all important, but if you really are serious about helping seniors, the government needs to do something about seniors and other vulnerable consumers who are being taken advantage of every day at their very own doorstep, in their own home.” That’s when I decided to take this issue on, Speaker.", "I want to share with you a story that I heard from one of the seniors in my community that I think brings this to life. This person is a member of my seniors’ advisory group. One day, a senior in my community had a knock at the door. She opened the door, and there was a man standing there in an orange jacket, in a uniform. As she looked out beyond him on to the street, she saw a number of other men in matching orange jackets, knocking at the doors of her neighbours throughout her community. The gentleman said he was there with the energy company. He said that the energy company’s analysis showed that energy use was unusually high in that particular neighbourhood and that they believed it was due to non-compliant furnaces, and so he asked if he could inspect her furnace. He had a jacket, a badge and a name tag and everything like that. He looked very official. So she allowed him to come in and inspect her furnace. He went down to take a look and immediately determined that it was out of compliance, that the furnace was not consistent with requirements.", "But he said that he had a solution for her. He said that if she paid $129 a month right away and signed on the dotted line right there, on the spot, he could get her existing non-compliant furnace replaced very, very quickly and that, as it so happened, the government of Ontario was offering a rebate to people who replaced their furnaces for more energy-efficient ones, and that the rebate was $1,300 to anyone who signed up right away to get a new furnace. Of course, that rebate was a hoax, but she agreed to this. She thought he sounded legitimate and credible. He, of course, promised her that replacing her non-compliant furnace with a new one would allow her to save money on her hydro bill.", "After thinking about it, after he’d gone away and she had signed the contract, the next day she realized she thought she had been duped and she should have taken more time to make that decision. So, as is permitted by the law, there’s a cooling-off period that every consumer is entitled to. So she called the company back the next day and said she’d like to cancel, and they wouldn’t let her cancel. They weren’t allowing her to cancel. They gave her all kinds of excuses. Coincidentally, as she was on the phone with the company trying to cancel, the installers came with a new furnace. They came in, they tore out her existing furnace and they put in the new one. Throughout the whole period on the phone, the company refused to cancel, refused to stop the installers and they took away her perfectly fine furnace.", "She started getting billed immediately, $129 a month. She never got the government of Ontario rebate that he had talked about, of course, and even though she was told that she’d be able to save on her energy bill, no such savings ever materialized. She just started paying $129 a month for a furnace that replaced her existing furnace, which had been perfectly fine. When she complained and complained and complained, eventually the company who sold her the furnace said, “Well, listen, if you don’t want to pay the $129 a month, we can sell you the furnace we’ve already installed for $9,000.” Basically, they were offering to allow her to keep the furnace that she didn’t want if she paid another $9,000. That was how this company dealt with her.", "As I did more research, Speaker, I found out that stories like this are all too common, that people across Ontario continue to receive unwanted marketers at their door who use misleading, aggressive and coercive sales practices to entice people into contracts to take advantage of them. Under the guise of saving consumers money, many dishonest marketers dupe consumers into contracts that are more expensive than they should be, that have harsh cancellation fees or provide inferior products or services that don’t work at all, or certainly don’t work as advertised, as was the case in the story I just told you.", "The problem is particularly concentrated in a handful of products: in the sale and lease of air conditioners, furnaces, water heaters and water treatment devices. These four products alone cost consumers—those who reported their experiences to the government of Ontario—$3.2 million in 2015 alone. Now, these are just the people, for those four products, who reported what had happened to them to the government. You can imagine that there are going to be tens of thousands of consumers who wouldn’t have reported what had happened to them, who wouldn’t even realize that they had been duped. This number, this $3.2-million figure, really understates how impacted people are by these misleading tactics.", "So I decided I needed to do something about this and, after doing a lot of research and consulting with CARP, with the Consumers Council of Canada, with the Public Interest Advocacy Centre and with my own consumers, I introduced a private member’s bill in the spring, Bill 193, and I reintroduced it this fall as Bill 14 after the prorogation, which would have banned the sale of those four product categories that I talked about. Again, this is all about protecting vulnerable consumers from these tactics.", "Speaker, to me, it is beyond reprehensible that there are people, organizations and businesses out there who make a living, who have a business model that’s based on taking advantage of the most vulnerable people in our society. It has to stop. That’s why I introduced Bill 193 and then Bill 14, and that’s why I’m proud to stand here today in support of this bill, because I think this bill will do a tremendous amount to protect consumers from those very tactics.", "It’s important to strike a balance. I come from a business background, and we want to protect Ontarians from coercive sales tactics, but we also want to ensure consumers have choice and that small businesses are still able to thrive and that we, of course, don’t limit the activities of charities or not-for-profit organizations. I want to be very clear: This bill does not impede charities or community groups from going door to door and advocating. It doesn’t prevent the local student who wants to mow your lawn from coming to your door and selling you those services. It doesn’t prevent Girl Guides from coming to your door and selling you Girl Guide cookies. This is really talking about a few product categories where we know that there are consistently coercive practices being used. To me, this bill strikes the balance.", "Speaker, I started by talking about how I came here, like all of us came here, to make a difference for the people of Ontario. In my riding, in Etobicoke Centre, we have among the largest number of seniors of any riding in the province. Like I said, when I started hearing from members of my seniors’ advisory group that this was happening to them, that this was happening to people they knew, then I knew I had to do something. I knew that we had to do something. I’m proud to stand here today, Speaker, because this is a bill that indicates that our government wants to do something to protect seniors from these misleading, aggressive and coercive sales practices. This bill is making a difference for consumers and for seniors." ],

We talk about door-to-door sales, and a few months ago the government passed a bill giving a cooling-off period with regard to water heater sales, which was a good idea, and now they’re going to give the minister the power to ban whatever he or she may see fit at the door. It still doesn’t do much to educate the people of Ontario through the ministry of consumer affairs on the dangers of people going door to door or the phone calls you receive. I couldn’t tell you how many people get the phone call and end up giving a credit card to someone who doesn’t know what’s going on. Or the Internet: I couldn’t tell you how many aunts and uncles I’ve had die in Africa with an inheritance for me, where all I have to do is give them my bank number. This goes on.", "I say it’s a spoof, but someone out there is falling for these tricks. Otherwise, it wouldn’t continually happen over and over again. So hopefully the government, while they’re banning everything, can step forward and come up with an educational program, utilizing the ministry of consumer affairs. I bet you that 90% of the people don’t know this ministry exists.", "I’m hoping that maybe they can create an educational program to teach them, because the next step will be banning anybody phone-calling you, wanting to address any sort of sales. I don’t even know how you would start to ban sales via the Internet or these emails we get.", "You want to nip the problem as quickly as possible. The best way to do it is utilize the advantage they have as government, their ability to outreach to people throughout Ontario and to educate them. Let them know. Work with the local police forces and the health units. Let’s get some education out there so that people won’t be fooled by these door-to-door salespeople or the phone calls or the Internet. I don’t know why they don’t do that." ],

One principle that I’d like to see highlighted—and if we can focus in on this principle, we can provide some legislation that goes beyond the specifically defined areas and captures the heart of what we want to capture in terms of unfair practices—is high-interest, long-term contracts that people enter into, that provide a service and that people don’t have a vehicle or an avenue to get out of.", "That’s what we see again and again: People get into these high-interest contracts that are long-term. There’s really no way to get out, and they end up paying far more than what the item is worth, in terms of the interest. There’s no way to then extricate yourself from the situation; you’re forced to pay a significant penalty. That’s really the principle that we want to address.", "I think this bill does certainly address the specific areas where we’ve seen complaints—water filtration systems, other home services, energy services—but we need to make sure that the bill is broad enough to cover the concept of the unfairness.", "The other area that I want to reiterate—though the House leader mentioned that the bill does provide some specifics around payday loan companies, the key issue that is not addressed by this legislation is the interest rate. That’s really at the heart of where people are being exploited. It’s the high interest rates that are charged by the payday loan companies.", "That’s where we need to see this government step up and provide some leadership. That’s the area where we would see some significant protection to those who are vulnerable. That’s what I call on this government to do with the amendments. Moving forward, we look to addressing that high interest rate." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to rise and speak for a little while on Bill 59, the Putting Consumers First Act.", "I think that I want to start my remarks on the home inspection business. A number of years ago, we purchased a property up in the Bruce Peninsula. It had a house on it, but it needed some work, if I can put it that way. Fortunately, my wife and I had been involved in the renovation business for a number of years, and I have two sons in the trades. So we took a chance on this and we thought we would tackle it. We did our own inspection on the house and we saw a number of issues that certainly were there and priced it accordingly.", "If you saw the movie on TV a number of years ago where Griswold—I think that was the fellow’s name—plugged the Christmas lights up, well, that’s the number of lights that were around this place. It was all down the laneway. He was a very nice man who owned this place, and he was very proud of this. But we saw some wires hanging out of the socket, which is the underpart of where your eave comes over, and we were a little suspect as to the wiring that was in there.", "Anyway, we made the purchase and we decided to start fixing this place up to what we wanted. My one son is an electrician, so he started to repair some of the wiring. We found extension cords used throughout the eavestrough to light the Christmas lights up. It wasn’t an expensive extension cord that was used; it had orange coating on it, and usually that’s about the cheapest you can buy. So that was wired back and hooked onto a couple of other spots, because I’m sure when it was wired up the first time, he probably didn’t have enough power to run all the lights, so he continued on to go here and there with this extension cord. So we disconnected that.", "Then we got into doing some things around the kitchen in this place and we noticed some—and we had seen this before we bought the place, but it looked like smoke or black soot. We took the covers off and, sure enough, there were some issues with the plugs back there.", "My son the electrician got busy and did a lot of rewiring of the place and certainly tore out a bunch of these extension cords that were used to light up the Christmas lights and other things. While he found that, in the ceiling we found some exposed—I believe they call them junction boxes. They’re round and wires come into them. They had just actually put the ceiling up over that without putting a cover on. So those all got ripped out.", "By the time my son got done the rewiring of this place and fixing up the panel box, there was quite a considerable amount of money involved that we had to pay him. But this was payback time with my family, with my sons, so I get this labour for free, which is kind of nice. Certainly, the ordinary person would be paying $40 or $50 per hour for a qualified electrician to do this, and maybe more than that.", "We were very fortunate that I had the help, and, as I say, Jane and I have been involved in the renovation business for quite a few years, so we were able to spot some trouble spots in this place. But we could do it ourselves. We could fix these places up. I know the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound saw this place, and it was quite a transition from when we bought it to what we have now. But again, it was because we had our own labour.", "I can imagine somebody buying this place—there’s quite a lot of land involved here; that’s basically the reason we bought the property—and falling in love with the fact that it had all this land, and, “We can deal with the house later,” and getting into a mess without having somebody go into the place and look at it and say, “Look, I think you’re going to be spending” however many dollars on this place before it was livable. Because certainly, with some of the wiring connections especially that we’d found before we purchased it, it wasn’t safe. I can imagine that there would have been a lot of money spent.", "So I’m glad the home inspection business is addressed here because, as has been previously stated, I could hang a sign out at my place and say I’m a home inspector right now, and do that without being regulated. That is going on right now across the province. In fact, we have run into that a couple of times in our business, where homeowners have said to us when we’re in there, “Well, we had this inspected,” and we hadn’t really ever heard of the fellow that did it—and found some issues. So I’m glad this is being addressed in this bill.", "The other thing I would like to talk about too is the payday lending part of this bill. Education plays an important part, certainly, in any financial transaction. Being educated as to how finances work when you take a mortgage out or when you borrow money at a bank for a car or whatever—and certainly, to do with the payday lending industry, you should be educated on just exactly what you’re getting into. I do know that there are people who use this because they can’t get deals through the normal lending institutions.", "But, you know, Speaker, our member from Nipissing has tabled a bill on educating high school children in financing. I think that’s just an excellent idea, that they get a basic understanding of how finances work and how to work through the process so that they understand what they’re getting into before they sign on the dotted line. I believe it goes through the use of credit cards and that type of thing so that, if they decide to purchase something on credit versus cash, they know the ramifications of the whole thing and what they’re going to pay at the end, because as you well know, Speaker, if you buy something for $1,000 and borrow the money, it’s going to cost you more at the end because of interest rates. I do believe that this bill that the member from Nipissing has before the House—I hope it comes up for debate soon because I think it’s quite important that we start young, in the high schools, and that we start teaching our young folks the ins and outs of the lending business so that they can make informed decisions if they choose to borrow money for what they need.", "There are a couple of other issues I would like to speak about in this bill. One has to do with door-to-door sales. There many people that make their living off door-to-door sales who are quite reputable. They’ve done it all their lives, and people get to know them. I hope it doesn’t affect them too much. It’s the door-to-door sales—because we always get calls. I know in my office I get a couple of calls every year about some couple being ripped off on siding or windows or something in their house. They pay a bunch of money up front and then they never see the guy, sometimes. So I think we have to address that problem, but again, that’s education. You should only deal with people that you know. Before you hand out cash or write a cheque for anything, you should maybe call the Better Business Bureau or something like that to see if it’s a reputable company and that you’re not just dealing with a fly-by-nighter.", "Again, that gets back to education. The public should be educated that way, or should educate themselves. We can’t protect everybody against everything. The public has to take some responsibility as to what they do and what they get into. But these high-pressure salesmen that deal with this shifty door-to-door-sales business are very good at what they do. They’re very high-pressure people, and they’re very good at their job. We can see that this has happened, actually, with the wind farm business, where people have signed over their land to some of these salesmen. They’re very good at what they do. Then they find out they can’t get out of their lease of their land. They find out that there are some things in the lease that they’re not very comfortable with, but unfortunately they can’t get out of it. I think this bill does address some of these things." ],

We don’t need that at all.", "What we do need is access to affordable credit, credit that’s reasonable, and we need a government that regulates the insurance that’s charged and doesn’t allow these payday loan companies to misleadingly say, “We’re just charging $18 for every $100 you take from us,” making it sound like it’s only 18% interest, when in fact if you annualize that interest, it’s literally closer to 400% interest. That is unacceptable. It’s reprehensible. In fact, according to the Criminal Code of Canada, it’s a criminal offence, usury, to charge more than 60% interest. But due to certain loopholes, the government allows payday loan companies to charge—if you annualize the interest rate—400% interest. That’s completely unacceptable.", "What we do need to see, though, is this government taking steps to make sure that people don’t need payday loan companies in the first place. We need to make sure that the government makes life more affordable—and that when people can’t afford, they have access to real alternatives, like credit unions and financial institutions, which provide loans at reasonable rates. That’s what we need. Any company that charges a 400% interest rate should not be allowed to do that. That’s what we need to regulate.", "When it comes to the member’s comments around education, I think that’s a very solid point with respect to any sort of contract. I think the consumer needs to have the ability to make the decisions about getting into a contract and if it makes sense or not. But again, that doesn’t dismiss the fact that this government has a responsibility to ensure that people are protected.", "When it comes to door-to-door sales, this is a step forward. We need to ensure that the principles, though, that we are trying to implement are—the long-term, high-interest contracts that are pressure-tactic sales at the door are the types of sales or types of strategies that are prevented." ],

Certainly, we don’t want to overregulate something. We want to make sure the regulations are good and that people are still able to make a living at what they do.", "Speaker, I can speak a little bit about overregulation and what it has done to the Perth part of my riding. Did you know that there are no abattoirs left in Perth county? They’re gone—except there are a couple of big abattoirs. We used to be able to take a cow and a pig over to an abattoir that was close to us, but they’re all shut down. Some of them have been due to retirement, but a lot of them have been due to regulations that have been imposed upon them. They just said, “We’re not doing this anymore,” because it seems that when an inspector comes in, he changes something or he does this or that. We never, ever got sick off the meat that was brought out of that plant that we used. We used that abattoir for years and never got sick off it. I don’t want to see that happening with what this legislation is proposing here—that we get it so regulated that it feels like you’ve got somebody looking over your shoulder all the time and wondering what you’re doing. Let’s make the regulations simple so that you can understand them, that those who want to be involved in the business—either the home inspection business or some of the other things that we’re talking about here—know the rules, they’re easy to follow and they can make their living off it. That’s what we need to do here, because it’s really sad when we have the most animals, I believe, in Ontario in our riding of Perth–Wellington, and in Perth county, you can’t take one to slaughter. You can’t get it done." ],

We’ve had, I think, only seven hours on Bill 70. It’s going to be voted on tomorrow, and the committee is already set to meet on Bill 70. It’s an omnibus piece of legislation which deserves our full attention and full debate, and it does not look like that piece of legislation is going to get there. It’s also unfortunate, though, because Bill 70 does have some consumer protection issues contained within it, which I touched on last week.", "But I do think we just need to take this debate back to a place around: What is consumer protection? What does the government think of consumer protection? What do we think of consumer protection? But more importantly, what are the expectations of the citizens that we serve, and what should they be receiving as a benchmark, if you will, from the government? I think it’s safe to say that there are some outstanding gaps.", "The door-to-door sales of water heaters and other services, which have become more and more aggressive over the years, particularly on those people who are vulnerable in our communities—we’ve been dealing with many of these issues in the four years since I have been elected.", "One fellow in particular was very much taken advantage of, and I would describe that situation as being very predatory against him. The door-to-door salesman identified a weak individual, who had some issues around dementia, and completely took advantage. Helping that individual undo the damage of that aggressive action against him—because it certainly wasn’t for him—through legal aid and having an advocate, was a huge amount of work, to try to secure justice for him.", "As it relates to Bill 59, New Democrats are, of course, very supportive and welcoming of legislation that would raise the bar, if you will, on protection against aggressive and predatory door-to-door sales folks who knowingly entrap particularly seniors, in this instance, into contracts that they can neither afford nor do they need. It’s very concerning.", "The issue of consumer protection—even driving in this morning, I was driving in on my 3:45 a.m. drive from K-W, because I need to get here. I know you know this drive very well. On CBC, there was a lady who was discussing the fact that she had been a victim of credit card fraud. There was an investigation, and it was found that it was not her—she didn’t put this exorbitant amount of money on her credit card—yet her credit rating remained damaged because of that action for years. There were no checks and balances on securing an appropriate credit rating.", "One other fellow came to me, and he said he had booked reservations at a hotel. He arrived a little bit late, and his room was gone. They had already resold the room. If he paid for the room, he should get the room.", "There are inconsistencies, from a consumer protection perspective, across this province.", "I think it would surprise a lot of people to discover that home inspectors are not a regulated sector, that the qualifications are very minimal and that no one is watching the home inspectors.", "Now, this isn’t to say that there aren’t some ethical, principled people out there who take a lot of pride in the trade, as they would describe it. However, there are others who charge exorbitant rates, who deliver sub-par services and whose own interests trump the interests of the homeowner, and that is most unfortunate.", "Bill 59 on this, though, is going to create another administrative authority for home inspectors. It’s going to regulate a class of debt collectors not previously captured under the Consumer Protection Act—and I’ll talk about that quickly in a minute—and it regulates and bans certain door-to-door, high-pressure sales tactics.", "The regulations that are set forth in this piece of legislation on the payday loan industry mostly download powers to regulate industry onto municipalities. The issue of the increased number of payday loan organizations—private companies, private businesses—it’s really a tell-tale sign that your community is hurting when you see these organizations and these companies pop up in your city, because they are very strategic about where they go, where they set up. They recognize where there are certain vulnerabilities in the local economy such that people will eventually have to seek out some fast cash. What Bill 59 fails to do is, really, to set out the rules of engagement. If the government is going to be supportive of this industry, of this sector, what are the rules of engagement for them? What are the true guidelines around protection for consumers?", "Schedule 2 of Bill 59 amends the existing act overseeing the industry and opens up the Municipal Act and the City of Toronto Act to prevent payday lenders from operating in designated areas where municipal bylaws have been passed. This is a small control factor that will now be in the hands of municipalities.", "It does create a regulatory framework to set limits of how many times payday lenders can loan to individual borrowers in a set period. Also, it would extend payment plans for repayment and it limits products that payday lenders can market, like cash cards, though they are not specified. I’m sure that we all remember last Christmas in Hamilton, where there were a number of payday loan companies that were accepting gift cards from people and offering them 50% on the value of the card. We call that stealing, really. It’s a form of theft. If you brought in your Starbucks card for $50, they would give you $25 for it. That’s still within the rules, and we don’t know if those rules have been changed, because it’s all been set to regulation.", "What the bill doesn’t do—I think that hopefully this can be amended at committee; we certainly will be trying to amend it—is cap the interest rates on loans. The ministry suggests that the schedule is already set to lower January 1, annually, in 2016-17. However, anti-poverty advocates who have been pushing for reform on payday loans organizations forever, it seems, don’t think that lowering the borrowing rates to $18 for every $100, as proposed, is enough, as that would result in a 390% interest annualization, as the member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton has spoken about. This is well above other lending products and impossibly high for Ontario’s most vulnerable workers.", "This is the classic case of a government bill coming before us which incorporates three other private members’ bills. All the speakers have acknowledged that the loan interest rates are exorbitant, that they are problematic, and yet it is not included in the legislation. This always begs the question. The government side will always concede, “Well, we can always do more,” but you have an opportunity. It has been a long time coming for the Putting Consumers First Act (Consumer Protection Statute Law Amendment). This is An Act to enact a new Act with respect to home inspections and to amend various Acts with respect to financial services and consumer protection, and yet they have left it open for interpretation.", "This leaves me feeling that if you can always do more with a piece of legislation, why don’t you do it? Why don’t you create a piece of legislation which actually meets the needs of the people of this province? Why do we have to keep revisiting some common themes around affordability? When I think of the elderly man whom my office was trying to help—that man was facing high hydro costs. His house needed to be renovated. He hadn’t been able to access the previous renovation tax credit. He was isolated, because there was a lack of social programming in the community. So when somebody shows up on his doorstep and says, “I want to help you,” those are magic words to a senior citizen, Mr. Speaker.", "If anything comes of this legislation that is very productive, I would hope that the focus would be on having a comprehensive definition of consumer protection." ],

He gets pretty emotional when it comes to matters of consumer protection, and in his opening remarks he made references to “shysters” when it comes to this particular legislation. He of course completely understands that there are many well-intentioned people who work in this particular field, but it is a very difficult piece when we know that there are people in the field who are giving the rest of them a difficult time and a bad reputation. As such, the need for this kind of legislation to come forward to protect consumers is incumbent upon government. So that’s what we have before us here today.", "I think perhaps “disreputable” might be a better word for us to describe some of those who are in the field. We understand that there are a lot of people who work very hard and make a good living and contribute to the economy of Ontario in this particular field, but unfortunately there are a number of people who do not act in such a good fashion.

For whatever reason, Hydro One was having a very difficult time three or four years ago getting it right. I can tell you that the staff at my office were working diligently, as I am sure is the case in a number of other offices across the province, to deal with that particular issue.

I think that is a good thing, as I think all would think.", "When it comes to home inspectors and the single largest purchase, likely, that anyone is to undertake in their lifetime, we find ourselves in a situation where people are buying these homes, sometimes, on the advice of a home inspector. Some are very good and some are not. I would say that this is a great example of where we need regulation and we need protection, because there are some really, really good suppliers of information and work in this sector. They are the people who would be most interested in seeing this regulation come in because they want their industry to be protected and not to have reputation that they’re providing bad advice when people are making purchases hundreds of thousands of dollars in value. So we’re doing that.", "I have just about a minute left, but one of the things I would say is that there has been some criticism that perhaps we shouldn’t do this because you can’t get it perfect, you can’t get it right, and the bad guys who are out there who are unscrupulous and practising poorly will always find a way to end-run the legislation, will be creative. There is always some truth to that, but I don’t think it means that we shouldn’t try. I don’t think it should mean that we shouldn’t be bringing forward consumer protection regulation.", "I remember when the deep recession hit in 2008 and one of the advantages that Canada had over the United States was the regulation that existed in our banking sector. One of the reasons that Canada came through the recession—I won’t say as well as we did, but perhaps we didn’t see the carnage that occurred in the United States in that particular sector—was because of the regulation that was in place at the time governing our banking sector. I know there are some political parties that would not have brought that sort of regulation into place. Thank goodness we had it in Canada because, as difficult as that period of time was, without that protection, the situation that occurred in our country through the recession would have been much worse.", "So consumer protection is very important.", "I see my time is up.

I met with the Ontario Real Estate Association last week, and they were supportive of licensing home inspectors, and I know that the association of home inspectors is in favour of that.

A lot of them don’t necessarily make any difference, but they do make a difference in the lives of businesses and individuals and the cost of trying to do business in the province of Ontario.

I think it’s really important that the general public knows about things and we start with the young people, young people like the person here from the St. Thomas area, so that he could be educated on some financial matters so he wouldn’t be getting into any trouble. I think that’s something that we have to concentrate on, to make sure our young people are educated in financial matters so they don’t get themselves into jams.", "We also have to protect people who are older than us who get involved with salesmen who come to put windows or siding in and expect a big down payment and then you never see them again. That’s certainly something that’s very important.", "And it’s a great idea to regulate the home inspection agency. These guys want to do a good job. They might as well be on the same page, because they want their reputations as good as they can be. I’m sure that this bill will help strengthen that." ],

When people are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars—the largest single purchase they are likely to make in their entire lifetime—I think it’s incumbent upon us to do what we can. I believe home inspectors are perhaps the only industry related to a home purchase that is not in some way, shape or form regulated. It’s a gap. It’s a hole that we need to fill.", "When it comes to consumer protection, I just think, as I said in my opening remarks, it’s important for us—I like to do this occasionally—to give a shout-out to the staff in my constituency office, because one of the core services that they have provided to my constituents for 13 years is when it comes to matters of consumer protection: Karen O’Connor; Sharla Knapton; Norine Carroll, who is no longer with me; Jeff Howie; and Lindsay Fron. They do a terrific job of representing me as the MPP and our office, as we do our outreach for the constituents of Thunder Bay–Atikokan.", "We have a good piece of legislation here.

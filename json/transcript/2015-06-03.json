  "text" : [ "Speaker, I’m glad to come back and finish the debate I started last night. I only have a few minutes left, and I hope to just review what I spoke about for the last 15 minutes in the House. That’s basically discussing that this legislation, unless fully utilized and brought out to the people of Ontario, might only amount to photo op legislation, where the government can pass this bill, have the Great Lakes Protection Act, get a good photo with it and make the headlines. As we’ve seen with other bills this government has brought forward, there’s usually no action after instituting them. I’m hoping that we can look back at this bill three years down the road and see some tangible results, instead of it just being passed at one part of this year.", "As my constituent Mark Wales has said, we need qualitative and quantitative end points so that we can look back and see how we’ve achieved this. I’ve outlined the fact about the funding model that isn’t present to ensure that some of these initiatives go forward. I refer back to the Invasive Species Act where, in speaking with many conservation authorities throughout the province in my critic portfolio, they’re concerned that no money is going to follow the Invasive Species Act. While the powers might be there to deal with invasive species, there’s no funding to actually carry through and deal with much of the invasive species that the conservation authorities are looking to deal with, especially in my area near Long Point, where phragmites has basically taken over the entire area that was once a beautiful place to go duck hunting. They had a great habitat for ducks to come, but unfortunately the phragmites is slowly just diminishing the habitat.", "There was a bit of talk on the other side of the House about nutrient runoff, mainly blaming the farmers of this province, that I’d also like to quickly talk about. That’s kind of concerning, considering these guardians’ councils are supposed to be composed and decide what’s going to go on around the Great Lakes. We need to ensure that farmers are adequately represented on these councils, because you can’t just blame the farmers for nutrient runoff. They’re trying to do their part with improving their farming practices to minimize nutrient runoff. In particular, they usually have moved away from tilling the property, which greatly enhances the maintenance of nutrients in the soil. However, with the neonic ban coming forward from this government, you might see that practice diminish and therefore increase the nutrient runoff.", "However, we’ve got to look at other sources of nutrient runoff in this province. As I mentioned before, when developers come in and build a new subdivision, the first thing they do is take away all the good soil on top of the land, build their subdivision and then only replace a small amount, which prevents proper runoff of rainwater, in washing their lawns, because the ground underneath is usually clay, and it doesn’t soak in quite well. So you’ll see a lot of the nutrients that they do put on with fertilizers and such run right off into the catch basins, into our water systems and out into the lakes.", "We also have to look at municipalities and ensure that their sewage treatment facilities are on par and working well. Too often you might see a bad rainfall, or flooding in some instances, that overruns sewage maintenance plants and unfortunately ends up in our lakes and streams, causing quite a bit of the increased nutrients in our Great Lakes.", "Of course, we’ve got the Americans on the other side of the border, who have their own farming practices that aren’t as superb as the ones in Ontario.", "In culmination of all the various items I have mentioned, you can’t just blame the Ontario farmer. I would hope that the government moves away from focusing on the Ontario farmer. They are the economic engine of this province; the only industry that seems to be able to make a go of it at this point in time. Particularly in my riding, they are definitely keeping our area employed, per se, as they are the ones who are able to buy new trucks and equipment and spend money in the cities, because this government hasn’t found a way to destroy their industry yet, although I’m sure they’re looking to do so.", "As I said earlier, just to recap: the funding model is not there; there’s no local autonomy being returned to the municipalities—we’d like to see them stop putting up industrial wind turbines without the permission of local municipalities; there’s no respect for landowners—being able to go on anybody’s property without a warrant is a slippery slope to head down; again, I mentioned the guardians’ council—the Ministry of Natural Resources can’t even form a fishing management zone council over the last seven years. Zone 16 is still unformed, per se. It’s a smaller council than the Great Lakes council.", "I look forward to questions and comments." ],

He’s in Elgin–Middlesex–London; I’m in Essex—a lot of rural agricultural land. We are adjacent to Lake Erie, and so we understand the complexities of living near a lake and also living in a very high density of farmland. We have to understand and know the impacts this bill potentially could have on our agriculture community. That’s why, as New Democrats, we’ve called for this bill to not only have broad consultation, given that it is broad in its scope and far-reaching, but also to travel this bill to all quadrants of the province so that we have good information from those who will be impacted by the bill and we can collect the right amount of data.", "Last night, I heard the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change talk about the fact that this will be a mechanism to collect further data and to address some of the issues related to climate change and to new processes coming about, whether they be industrial or agricultural, and to ensure that we can mitigate against those processes and ensure the protection of the Great Lakes. Now, that’s all well and good; however, if we don’t have the resources tied to this bill—meaning money, frankly—then our fear is that it won’t have the desired effect and certainly won’t carry the protection that the title of the bill states." ],

She will see her name now in Hansard and be pleased with that.", "We have to look at all of the sources. I think the member is correct in saying, “Don’t concentrate on just one source or another.” There are significant sources everywhere. But governments, and particularly environment departments, wherever the jurisdiction happens to be, must be prepared to take significant action, because those who do reside on Lake Erie, for instance, in the case the member mentioned—when you have Lake Erie nearby, you know the problem that the algae is having along there. It’s not just the odour and the look of it, which is very unattractive, but it’s the fact that it can become quite toxic as well.", "So looking for all ways to be able to deal with this is important. The Great Lakes, as we know, are a real gem that we share with the United States. They’re exceedingly important. We’ve made some progress over the years in terms of the cleanup, but population increases new substances that are introduced to it. When this bill was introduced a few years ago now, it seems to me, when I happened to be Minister of the Environment, we were looking at all of those opportunities to deal with this.", "I think the comments of all members of the House have been valuable in dealing with this particular piece of legislation, and I thank the member for his contribution." ],

They have something that they talk about as being so important, but there’s no funding in it, so what are the real plans?", "My riding runs along the St. Lawrence. We have five or six water treatment plants that draw their water from the St. Lawrence River in our area, so water is very important.", "But it is also a collaborative affair. We’re one of many jurisdictions on the water, on the Great Lakes, that have an input, but certainly, the neighbours to the south—we have committees where they’re already involved, and I wonder if it wouldn’t be better to work more with that instead of just forming another committee to look after the Great Lakes. How many applications and how many expert panels do you have?", "I was somewhat surprised when my colleague talked about the possibility of not having an agricultural rep on it, but I guess when you look at the track record of this government, there’s good reason why the agricultural community is somewhat concerned that they won’t have a rep on it. They get mentioned many times as being one of the causes, although when you drive along the Great Lakes, you see many good farms being bulldozed and houses being put up, so I don’t know if you look at the total picture. Really, the impact of agriculture—agriculture is a green industry, and it’s probably our number one industry. I think that if you are going to go with a guardians’ council, they should be a very big part of it, in a percentage that’s reflective of the industry and the impact they have on it." ],

That’s 95% of the agricultural land in Ontario. This bill covers the majority of my riding, and I’m six hours straight north. Eight hours straight north of here: This bill covers it. So it’s a very important bill for agriculture, depending on how it’s implemented.", "I’ve seen some of the press releases, and reading the bill—sometimes they’re acting like this is the first step to protect the Great Lakes, and that’s patently untrue. Specifically, the agriculture sector has been working for years with the government—with various governments—to do their part to protect the environment, and specifically the Great Lakes, with nutrient management plans. Most farmers have environmental farm plans. We have to be crystal clear that those are taken into account, and that they’re not simply superseded when someone comes up with a bright new idea out of nowhere, and thinks they’re going to solve all the problems. That’s where this bill is dangerous. We have to make sure that the regulations under this bill actually make sense for the industry." ],

However, we’ve got to ensure that it’s definitely a bill that’s actually going to do something other than create a photo op for this government. We do have to remember, when they create these local councils to oversee areas—these guardians’ councils—the fact that this bill is giving them the power to supersede so many other laws in our area, including planning bylaws. This could actually affect the development of certain cities and areas, which we do have to be concerned about. Hopefully, these guardians’ councils do not become like the LHINs have become in our health care system, where they’re these far-off groups of people who are making decisions about health care.", "On our local LHIN, one person out of all of Elgin county is the voice for the people of our area with local health care concerns.

It’s the fastest-growing Great Lakes jurisdiction.", "If the Great Lakes regions, including Ontario, Quebec and the eight Great Lakes states, were treated as a single economy, it would be the fourth-largest in the world, with a GDP of $5.1 trillion and 56 million jobs.", "The Great Lakes waters help generate 80% of Ontario’s electricity, including hydroelectricity and cooling for power plants.", "Ontario’s commercial Great Lakes fisheries contributed about $234 million to Ontario’s economy in 2011, and Great Lakes regional anglers—of which I’m proudly one, Speaker—contribute more than $600 million annually to Ontario’s economy. I can attest to that on how many lures I lose.", "In 2010, Ontario’s Great Lakes region attracted over 73 million tourists. These tourists spent approximately $12.3 billion.", "Great Lakes shipping routes stimulate nearly $16 billion in annual economic activity in Ontario and Quebec.", "The watersheds of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River basin include all of southern Ontario and a large section of northern Ontario, as well as large sections of the United States, including eight Great Lakes states, and Quebec. These watersheds are home to 40% of Canadians, 75% of Canadian manufacturing, and one third of Canada’s agriculture and processing jobs.", "Over the last 400 years there have been accelerated stresses on our Great Lakes ecosystem. These main stresses include overfishing; nutrient loading; excess phosphorus and nitrogen due to human waste and urban and agricultural runoff; toxic chemicals; land use practices—for example, filling in wetlands and modification of shorelines; invasive species and animal species—the sea lamprey, Asian carp, zebra mussel; hydrologic alterations—diverting water flows with dams and channels; and climate change, of course, where we see higher volumes of climate-related weather patterns. Those stats should show us quite clearly that our Great Lakes are literally our lifeblood not only to our own personal and communal health but to our economic health as well. We rely on them maybe more than we even know. All the more reason for us to do everything that we can.", "As I stated in my previous hit, this bill is far-reaching. As my colleague from Timiskaming–Cochrane stated, it has the potential to be either a really, really good bill, and something that can be incredibly functional, or it could be a waste of time, and potentially disastrous if it isn’t done in the right way with the right consultation and the right emphasis.", "We, certainly, as New Democrats support this bill and we support the Great Lakes. We believe that access to water is a basic human right, and the Great Lakes are a shared public good. I don’t think anyone in this House would disagree with that. The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin is obviously hugely important to our ecology, tourism and economy, and we need lakes and rivers that are drinkable, swimmable and fishable.", "In terms of being potentially comprehensive legislation, we would say that this bill is long overdue. However, if you look at what exists in Great Lakes legislation and protection, we have several mechanisms that prescribe different controls and acts of law to protect the Great Lakes.

The Conservation Authorities Act—I was talking about my colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh who spent many years on town council and also sat on the Essex Region Conservation Authority board and dealt with some of those issues in our region. He mentioned some of the great work that ERCA has done over the years to enhance our Great Lakes area and the surrounding areas of Windsor and Essex counties.", "I just want to give a shout-out to those who work at ERCA and who continue to endeavour to protect our Great Lakes and our watersheds, specifically Tim Byrne who is a long-standing member and conservation officer with ERCA; he does a great job. He’s a wonderful spokesperson for our region and is very knowledgeable and has a lot of experience in rural affairs as they pertain to the health of our Great Lakes. He’s someone who has put a lot of thought into the effects of human activities and what they do to our Great Lakes and our water systems. He comes from a farming family—the Byrnes are well-known, long-time farmers in Essex county—so he gets that juxtaposition of the protection of water as well as ensuring that we have economic development in our agriculture development. He certainly would take that balanced approach.", "What we’re asking and calling for the government to do, certainly within the context of this bill, is to find that balance. We would propose that the balance could be found through broad consultations. Travel this bill; get it out there. It’s too far-reaching to just contain it in this House with the knowledge that we have and that our researchers can dig up for us. We have to talk to people like Tim Byrne. We have to talk to farmers out there who have been ensuring best practices—not only ensuring them but actually were the innovators of them: no-till practices that contained nutrients and ensured that we were able to avoid runoff into our watersheds. There are a lot of lessons to be learned out there that we can take from those on the ground. I hope that the government is confident enough in this bill and the prescriptions of this bill that they can go out and talk to people. We certainly would appreciate that and would support that in all measures.", "One of the things that the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change spoke about yesterday—he hit on a lot of issues. He came in for a two-minute hit and he kind of elaborated on why we need this bill. I appreciated the information that he delivered to us. He talked about nutrient runoff. He talked about some of the invasive species that are micro-organisms that we don’t even know about. We talk about the zebra mussel, the round goby and the Asian carp as being invasive species, maybe because we can see them, but there are potentially other micro-organisms that we don’t even know exist that have a detrimental effect on our water system.", "He hit on one that I don’t think we have paid enough attention to: the increased use and volume of pharmaceuticals that are found in our water treatment centres or facilities, municipal water treatment facilities. Our water treatment facilities are quite high-tech; they can do a lot of things. They use ozone. They use chemicals. They treat our water. By and large, you have seen that the drinking water quality in Ontario is among the very best in the world. However, when it comes to pharmaceuticals in our water system—when you go to your doctor, your doctor may prescribe you a certain medicine. They’ll give you the prescription, and maybe you might even get another prescription for another ailment. But what they’ll say, what they’ll clearly tell you, is, “You can take this pill, you can take this pill, but make sure you don’t mix it with this third pill, because that can have some detrimental and contraindication effects within the pharmaceuticals.”", "What we’re doing is, we are all pouring our own various pharmaceuticals into our water system, and it is having some very serious effects on the various ecosystems within the Great Lakes. We’re seeing reptiles in certain areas feeling the effects and having various potential mutations because we’re not able to treat pharmaceuticals. We just don’t know how to do that; the science isn’t there within our water treatment system.", "It’s something that I would love to see this government take a clear focus on and be the leader in Canada and around the world in terms of how we deal with this huge problem, the increased use of pharmaceuticals through human activity—how we’re going to deal with that, going into the future.", "The bill prescribes a lot of regulation through the Lieutenant Governor in Council, so we need to ensure that those are given due consideration. It’s always tough when we see a bill come through that prescribes so much to regulation, because there’s so much that is unknown. I think you heard it here today during the debate: We don’t know how much potential downloading of responsibility onto municipalities this bill will prescribe. There’s some concern out there within the Association of Municipalities of Ontario that this will, again, be another job that they will have to take on and find the resources to be able to do that. That’s certainly not a partnership that our communities in and around our Great Lakes are looking for. They’re looking for some leadership, through the provincial government, to actually tackle some of the issues that we see.", "Many have talked about nutrient runoff and its effects. We know that in other jurisdictions, mainly in the United States, they’re just starting to tackle this problem. We’ve had the Nutrient Management Act since 2002. It’s a statute that was enacted following the Walkerton inquiry. It requires farmers and those operators to develop nutrient management strategies as part of source water protection, and large livestock operators in Ontario have had to be in compliance with the act since 2005.", "We’ve been ahead of the curve on this, and our agricultural community has done a lot of work in ensuring that they maintain the nutrients that are on their fields. We’ve heard why. Certainly, as stewards of the environment and of the land, they understand that they have a vested interest in maintaining not only the health of their plots of land but the health of their communities so that we can all enjoy, ultimately, the fruits of their labour. They get that circle of life, or that economic circle.", "What they also do not want to do is waste any money. They would literally, if they didn’t embark on those best practices, be flushing it down the drain. We understand that in the New Democratic Party, and we certainly want to support those farmers and recognize them when they are utilizing those best practices. That’s something we don’t do.", "Of course, we understand what happened in Toledo, Ohio—I believe it was close to two years ago—where they had such massive agricultural runoff that it actually shut down their water treatment system and they had to have bottled water for a number of days, potentially weeks. It gave them cause to enact legislation to ensure that farmers were not spraying nutrients onto their fields when there was a high level of saturation or when there was an anticipated level of saturation due to the forecast.", "Speaker, we’ve been doing that in Ontario for years now. We understand that, and it’s certainly something that we see our farmers in Essex county utilizing, that type of nutrient management system.", "There are some things that the bill talks about that are new and potentially innovative, and one is geographically focused initiatives. We’re not quite sure what that specifically means. I guess it gives the minister the ability to identify specific projects in areas that they want to tackle. So whether they be acute issues in some areas—I don’t know how they plan on funding that or supporting that, through which mechanism, through the Ministry of the Environment, whether they’ll have sort of a SWAT team to go out and actually address these specific, geographically focused initiatives, because there is currently no type of body that does that.", "The other aspect that I guess is novel in this bill is the implementation and establishment of the Great Lakes Guardians’ Council, which will be made up of the Minister of the Environment as well as other stakeholders with connections to the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin. The council will meet at least once a year to discuss priorities for action, funding measures, targets and initiatives. This is a great idea. We should all get together and talk about the health of the Great Lakes. But what teeth will it have? We know the IJC, the International Joint Commission, is solely focused on the health and maintenance of the Great Lakes in an international context. They’ve done a lot of great work. There is a ton of research that comes out of the IJC. Will this council have the ability to embark on research projects? Will they have, again, legislative teeth to uphold some of the laws that are currently on the books? We’re not quite sure.", "What we do know is that the stakeholders who make up the Great Lakes Guardians’ Council should be very broad. We should see a broad segment of those who are in the agriculture industry, municipal leadership, and some laypeople too. Let’s just hear from normal people about what their effects are. Let’s bring in our community members who can spread that message about the fact that we may actually be doing something tangible to support the health of our Great Lakes.", "Speaker, I think I’m nearing the end of my time here.

When my father was a young boy, he’d fish for speckled trout in that lake. As a young boy, I was able to fish for bass in that river system.", "I would challenge people in today’s world to even find where that creek is, because it has dried up, the fish are gone and it’s nothing more than an algae-filled series of little ponds. So we see first-hand what happens when we don’t take care of our water systems.", "I’m hoping—and I believe—that this proposed legislation will go a long way to making sure that the water within the Great Lakes is protected and that future generations don’t see the degradation of water systems that I witnessed and my father witnessed over, really, a fairly short time of probably only 80 years or so.", "I know that in my riding of Newmarket–Aurora, even though we sit on the Oak Ridges moraine—known as the rain barrel—about 75% of our water in our riding is pumped from Lake Ontario and makes its way up to our distribution system.

That’s how we protect Lake Simcoe. Of course, it works, and it slowly is improving. However, when you look at the multiple jurisdictions that are on both sides of the border on the Great Lakes, I think it’s almost an impossibility to ever properly implement this bill.

That’s who is responsible. That takes in people from all across North America. As well, we have the Great Lakes mayors, who are also a group that’s trying to protect the Great Lakes. However, one province creating legislation when there are probably 75 other jurisdictions that are impacting this I think is a cause for concern.

The proposal by the federal government to create a nuclear waste depository along the basin of Lake Huron, miles under the ground, is frightening. That’s a nightmare waiting to happen, literally. Those who are opponents of this have been quite vocal. There are a lot of folks in the bordering United States who are making a lot of hay of this issue.

That’s discouraging.", "I would like to see a clear plan on this issue, specifically.

The implementation of this bill will result in the further erosion of local autonomy for communities across Ontario. The continual destruction of local autonomy by the provincial government is based on the demonstrably false premise that the environment continues to degrade, that local municipalities and private landowners are the cause of that degradation, that municipalities are either incapable or unwilling to successfully address environmental issues, and that a minister in Toronto and his hand-picked people know what is best for them and needs to set them straight.", "Many, many rural and northern Ontario residents and municipalities disagree with that flawed and, quite frankly, insulting assumption. To that end, in an effort to inform policy-makers of the needs of rural and northern Ontario, the Rural Ontario Municipal Association developed the Rural and Northern Lens to assist policy-makers to evaluate proposed policies. I want to focus on three specific questions included in the Rural and Northern Lens to illustrate a number of my misgivings with this bill:", "(1) Does the proposed initiative benefit or hinder the fiscal realities of rural and northern Ontario?", "(2) Does the proposed initiative have a business case that accounts for low and sparse populations?", "(3) Does the proposed initiative have adequate human and financial resources to be effective?", "The truth is, we don’t know the answers to any of those questions. Funds have not been allocated to Bill 66. In fact, the bill instructs the guardians’ council to recommend potential funding mechanisms—that would be the taxpayer, because we know one way or the other that is the one who will pay, whether through higher taxes or through higher product prices.", "In addition, there are no assurances that rural and northern municipally elected representatives or residents will be invited to participate, and even if they are invited to participate, that they will be listened to.", "Lastly, designated policies and regulations included within geographically focused initiatives will override the decisions of local elected officials, including local official plans and zoning bylaws.", "The structure of this bill is eerily similar to another provincial government boondoggle called the Green Energy Act. If the industrial wind turbines are so wonderful, why did the provincial government remove municipal decision-making authority with respect to wind turbines? Even after promising to stop imposing industrial wind turbines on unwilling hosts, the provincial government continues to do so, deaf to scientists, deaf to residents, deaf to taxpayers and deaf to municipalities.", "Given the open-ended nature of this bill, the question must be asked: What surprises does the provincial government have in store for residents that they feel it necessary to remove local decision-making authority? Time will tell, I’m afraid.", "Existing legislation: The provincial government claims that they need new legal tools to deal with emerging priorities. Yet when asked what those priorities are, the government states that the guardians’ council will identify priorities sometime in the future. So the provincial government needs legislation to address priorities that they cannot currently identify. That sounds very suspicious.", "The provincial government is in the habit, when introducing legislation, of insinuating that a hole exists with respect to environmental protection. This claim could not be further from the truth. Legislation, policies, regulations, agreements and organizations protecting the environment, and the Great Lakes specifically, have been in place for decades, including the Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Nutrient Management Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Water Opportunities Act, the Water Resources Act, the Conservation Authorities Act, the Planning Act, the provincial policy statement, the International Joint Commission, the Great Lakes committee of the Canada-Ontario Agreement and the US-Canada Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, to name just a few.", "To say that this bill will create overlap, duplication and conflict is an understatement, and all without the oversight of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. This is a very concerning trend: open-ended, vague, arbitrary legislation that allows the minister to consolidate power and essentially legislate on his own with little, if any, oversight.", "Accountability brings me to another concerning trend: the increased creation and/or use of outside groups. Groups that are unelected and unaccountable to the electorate for regulatory functions is not an innovative governance tool. It is nothing short of the creation of a shadow corporatist governance structure, the function of which is to bypass the legitimate legislative process.", "We have very telling examples of what happens when outside groups are given power and authority with too little or no oversight. For example, the lack of oversight and accountability of the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that resulted in an organization run amok, an organization that destroys people’s lives because they can, because they do not face the consequences for bad behaviour.", "The inherent conflict of interest created by delegating police powers to an organization that relies on fundraising, while addressed by the courts, still has not been addressed by the provincial government. In fact, despite their blatant abuse of power, the provincial government has recently decided to give the OSPCA more power—this heavy-handed, biased, unaccountable government.", "What conflicts of interest will be created by Bill 66? We don’t know yet, but we do know that NGOs are not above using their lobbying power and appointments to target political enemies, including local businesses. An appointment to the guardians’ council could potentially be used to encourage and legitimatize politically motivated attacks.", "Centralization and private property rights: Private property rights are the foundation of western civilization and democracy. Private property rights are the underpinning of our prosperity. Private property rights and the resulting prosperity are the reason our environment has improved and continues to improve. Centralized collective control of land inevitably leads to a worse environment. This is demonstrable. Unfortunately, in Ontario we have seen the incremental destruction of private property rights by all levels of governments over the last several decades.", "I fear that this bill, with its ill-defined and arbitrary authority, is the final nail in the coffin of private property rights in Ontario and, therefore, our prosperity and our environment, because without the wealth to fund investments into the environment, they won’t happen.", "A self-evident truth is that private property owners are the best decision-makers with respect to their property as they have a vested interest in investing in and improving their property compared to remote, centralized decision-makers who are unaccountable for the outcomes of their decisions. The best decisions for communities and the environment are made at the local level, whether by a local municipality or a private landowner.", "We know that increased centralization of decision-making and collective control of property results in decreasing prosperity and a degraded environment.", "One of the best, most visible examples of this phenomenon is just a couple of kilometres east of Queen’s Park, in Cabbagetown. In the 1940s a large swath of Cabbagetown was torn down to build Regent Park, a collectively owned and centrally controlled public housing project. It is true that Cabbagetown was a slum at the time, but it wasn’t because the residents were lazy or didn’t want a better environment but because they lacked resources.", "Over time, as the residents of Cabbagetown accumulated wealth, they invested their individually accumulated resources in their individual properties, and today Cabbagetown is a beautiful, green neighbourhood. Currently, homes in Cabbagetown routinely sell for well over $1 million. Also currently, Regent Park, collectively owned and centrally controlled, is being torn down. Regent Park degraded over time because its residents did not own the land and so did not have an incentive to invest in and improve their environment. Centralized decision-making authority and collective control of private land will remove the inherent incentive of private property owners to invest in their land and will inevitably result in a degraded environment.", "Censorship: What is rarely talked about in this House but what concerns me is censorship. This bill not only removes the decision-making authority of local authorities, including municipalities, it requires public bodies to support the decisions of the minister. In other words, elected officials, land use planners and other professionals working for a planning authority or local municipality cannot submit a dissenting view, even if the public is in disagreement, even if in their professional opinion, a designated policy is unwarranted and will result in bad outcomes. The question needs to be asked: What ugly surprises does the provincial government have in store for residents and municipalities that they felt it necessary to remove the ability of local decision-making authorities to dissent?", "Public consultations: Notice for the public hearing for Bill 6, the predecessor to Bill 66, was given approximately 36 hours prior to the hearing taking place. The hearing was held for one day, in a committee room at Queen’s Park. The short notice period limited hearing time, and the location of the hearing disenfranchised many resource user groups, landowners, municipalities, residents and other interested stakeholders who were unable to attend due to time and travel constraints.", "Given that the scope of this bill spans 105 of the 107 ridings in the province and so could potentially adversely impact the well-being of the vast majority of residents, municipalities, people and businesses in Ontario, I strongly recommend that the hearings be held in a variety of locations across the province and that ample notice be provided to the public prior to public hearings being held. People have a right to be heard, not simply to send in a submission which can be safely ignored, but to be heard by MPPs and other citizens alike, particularly rural and northern residents, who routinely feel ignored by this government.", "Again, I will refer to ROMA’s Rural and Northern Lens. There are just three questions that need to be answered prior to this bill being passed:", "Does the proposed initiative ensure that rural and northern communities are receiving equitable treatment or services relative to other parts of the province?", "Does the proposed initiative accommodate the aspirations of residents from rural communities and the north?", "Does the proposed initiative build upon the input and advice of rural residents, communities and municipalities?", "The provincial government needs to hear from a whole lot of people prior to passing and implementing this bill, so that Ontarians may ask questions and hold the government to account.", "In conclusion, a constituent sent me a very powerful quote the other day that sums this bill up quite nicely: “If you can’t trust people with freedom, how can you trust people with power?” The centralization of power in this bill, similar to the Green Energy Act, will not just disenfranchise private landowners, but also local communities. Rural Ontario doesn’t trust this government, and for good reason: Past behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour. We have witnessed communities devastated by the imposition of industrial wind turbines, which chop up birds, devalue property and make people sick.", "The arbitrary nature of this bill begs the question, what further environmentally destructive policies is the provincial government planning to impose on rural Ontario through this bill? Rural people are tired of being bullied by this government, whether it’s the utter mismanagement of Hydro One, the Green Energy Act, the imposition of industrial wind turbines on unwilling hosts, high and rising energy prices, the loss of 300,000 good manufacturing jobs, the Caledonia land dispute, the unnecessary College of Trades, the eco tax, the HST added to hydro bills, the cancelling of the OLG slots program at horse racing tracks, the carbon tax, the Ontario pension plan—the list is endless.", "Here is my last question for the provincial government: Crown land already comprises 85% of the province of Ontario.

In fact, I would say the people of this province want that to happen.", "The concern that I and others have is whether or not the government actually would act to protect the Great Lakes, given a number of events and initiatives on their part: the deep geologic repository that my colleagues from Algoma–Manitoulin and Essex have mentioned, putting a major nuclear waste dump along the shores of Lake Huron, using a technology that has already failed in the United States—there was a substantial fire and a release of radioactivity to the surface. We have to recognize that if we’re going to protect the Great Lakes, we have to do it in partnership with the other Great Lakes jurisdictions: Michigan, Illinois, Ohio. Frankly, they object to us threatening the Great Lakes with this deep geologic repository. They’re the people we’re going to have to depend on if we’re going to have a cohesive, comprehensive plan to actually protect the lakes.", "The other concern I have is that there was an oil spill this winter in Gogama. A CN train went off the rails; large amounts of oil were spilled; there was a substantial fire. There has been a cleanup going on, but to this point there has been no talk, no indication of an investigation that would lead to charges against CN for irresponsibility.", "I haven’t investigated it all.

First of all, I listened to the Conservative member opposite, and he seems to feel that there is no role for government in the environmental protection of our Great Lakes. But when we think of it, we have five Great Lakes. We have a huge population base. We have the cities of Toronto, Cleveland, Chicago, Thunder Bay, Detroit and numerous other towns in numerous jurisdictions—Ontario, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, a little piece of Pennsylvania, New York. The only way to coordinate a transnational response to this crisis is through what’s contemplated in this legislation, and that’s the Great Lakes Guardians’ Council. It’s not just Ontarians who have an interest in this; it’s all of those other jurisdictions and subnational jurisdictions, the Canadian government and the American federal government. If there ever was a place for government to play a role, it is in something like this.", "The second point that I wanted to address is the consultation with the First Nations and Métis communities. For thousands and thousands of years, the First Nations have been resident on the shores of the Great Lakes: Lake Superior, Lake Ontario and so on. In fact, Chicago is an aboriginal name; Toronto is an aboriginal name. Many other cities have aboriginal names. There are many, many First Nations that are situated along the various shorelines of the Great Lakes. They have built up knowledge over thousands and thousands of years about how to treat the water and how to manage these issues, and they should be consulted." ],

We are a big part of it—the largest part of it—but I heard earlier talk about the algae blooms in Lake Erie. That originates in Ohio, so we need to work with our partners to get those issues under control.", "It’s a great photo op. We can talk a lot about this. There is no funding in this.

We’ve got another title here that we can stand in front of the camera.”", "Ontarians are looking for results.

There is a chapter on a residential school at Six Nations, near Brantford, in your riding.", "Just let me, for a second, read one paragraph: “The British North America Act ... gave” the Prime Minister of the day “and the Canadian government complete control over the country’s aboriginal people. The government began” to establish “Indian boarding schools. Living at these schools, away from their families, the children could be completely controlled by the staff. Through a process known as assimilation, the children’s beliefs and behaviours would be forcibly adjusted to the European way of life.", "“The model for these schools”—that is, throughout Canada—“was the Mohawk Indian Industrial School (also known as the Mohawk Institute), in Brantford, Ontario.", "A former British army officer was in charge. The harsh daily routine, rules and regulations, were based on strict army training`... the Mohawk Institute inspired the system that followed.”", "Speaker, I was invited by Chief Ava Hill at Six Nations to visit the remnants of that school. It’s in a building now—it’s still there—and I was given a tour of the building. It was a visceral experience for me.", "I will tell you two things that I saw. One, the students at the school had a nickname for the school. It was called the Mush Hole. Why was it called the Mush Hole? We were taken down to the basement, and there were huge kettle drums in which mush—food—was prepared. That is what the students at the school ate, hence the nickname for the school: not the Mohawk Institute, but, in the aboriginal community, it was known as the Mush Hole. The students had great fear of being picked up or sent to the Mush Hole.", "The other part that stood out in my mind—and it was an emotional experience—I was taken to the third floor. Some of the students had pried out the bricks. There was an inner wall and an outer wall. Normally there would be insulation between the two walls. They had pulled out the bricks and made a little cave between the walls. We went in there, and what we saw was a hiding place for young students. Littering the floor of this hiding place were the bits and pieces that a child experiences in their life. There were a couple of candy wrappers; there were some torn pages from a comic book; there was a glove; there was a sock. There were the other things that children leave behind in their play places. These children hid out between the walls to escape the harshness of this residential school.", "In the book, there is a short quote from a resident of the residential school. His name was Geronimo Henry. He was a resident there from 1942 to 1953. He said, “They tried to convert me in there. They took away my ceremonies, my rituals and my language. They tried to assimilate us. They told us our religion and our rituals were the devil’s work ... they took away my language, my own spiritual beliefs, and my culture.” He lived in that environment for nine years.", "It was a harsh, bleak and loveless setting. That’s what I felt when I left the environment. It was a visceral experience—one of the most moving that I’ve had—that puts this in a real, real, live context.", "We are doing a number of things to ensure that Ontarians and the rest of Canadians have their own experience or understanding of what has happened in the residential school system. We’ve done a lot of things, but the thing that I’m most proud of, as I know the Premier and the Minister of Education are, is we have designed a curriculum to include the aboriginal residential experience in the curriculum.", "Our sense is that if students and, indeed, their parents and members of this Legislature were to leaf through this book, they would have a whole different, qualitative sense of what the residential school system was about and why the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was so important.", "There are many other things that we’ve done.

When taking a step back and considering what the individual children must have felt as they were forced into residential schools, you can’t help but share part of their pain. To me, this report is about those children.", "The first-person accounts of children and the way their families were changed and torn apart by the enrolment in residential schools is truly tragic. Of the over 150,000 First Nations children who passed through the Indian residential school system across Canada, the human toll is staggering. One out of every 25 First Nations children who attended residential schools died there and were buried there, oftentimes without their families being notified.", "Just as the legacy of the residential schools spans generations, so too must the subsequent education of future generations. I’m pleased to see the government including that in the school curriculum.", "It is our hope that our collective attitude has changed in this country and that greater understanding of the lives and traditions of our aboriginal peoples will continue by building trust and contribute to the healing process.", "I was proud in 2008 when Stephen Harper made the historic apology, on behalf of all Canadians, in which the federal government recognized that the great harm caused by Indian residential schools had no place in Canadian society.", "I’m also proud that Canada is one of the very few countries in the world where treaty rights are enshrined in our Constitution.", "Even with these national strides, it is impossible to read the tragic stories and first-hand accounts without emotion. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, we cannot undo what has been done in the past.", "The work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will help future generations to learn from this element of our collective history and, in time, bring some closure, we hope, to the terrible legacy of residential schools.", "Mr. Speaker, the PC caucus believes that the report is another step along the path to promoting reconciliation between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians, and we look forward to continuing the work it will take to bring forgiveness, healing and true reconciliation to all.

Residential schools denied children the sense of self that comes from being proud of one’s heritage, language, culture and traditions. These children were neglected. They were mistreated. They were abused, and sometimes they were killed.", "Tearing families apart, stripping away language and culture, substandard education and the destruction of community, all led to widespread poverty, which remains rampant in First Nations communities today.", "For too many, neglect, mistreatment, abuse and death remain the present realities of aboriginal people, particularly women. New Democrats are proud to join with Justice Sinclair in his call for a national inquiry into murdered and missing aboriginal women across this country.", "The findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission demonstrate more than simply a historic wrong. They demonstrate an ongoing failure to live up to our responsibilities to care for every person in our province. There are First Nations communities in Ontario that still rely on diesel generation for electricity, that lack access to clean drinking water, proper education, proper health care and good-paying jobs. It is unacceptable that there are people living in Third World conditions in a province as wealthy as ours, Speaker", "So, yes, today we do stand on the traditional territory of the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, but too often that recognition is as close as we get towards realizing our responsibilities to First Nations families.", "It is incumbent upon all of us not to allow this report from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to gather dust somewhere on a shelf. This report should be seen as a call to action. It should drive us to recommit to building a stronger relationship—as equals—with First Nations governments and First Nations peoples. We owe it to all of those who suffered and continue to suffer. We owe it to them to continue to work to build a better future together with our First Nations partners—a future based on mutual respect, equality and truth.", "I know the minister spoke about the curriculum initiative.

Building modern infrastructure is part of our government’s plan to continue growing the economy and create jobs.", "I know that in my community of Ottawa Centre, infrastructure investments, and specifically those in transit, are top of mind for many of my constituents. That’s why I’m proud that our government has made significant investment and will continue to make even more.", "There are three important infrastructure investments that I just want to quickly highlight, that are taking place in my community of Ottawa Centre and that are not only going to benefit my community but also the entire city of Ottawa, one being the building of phase 1 of the Confederation Line LRT in Ottawa. Our government is investing $600 million in building this state-of-the-art LRT system that will start in my community of Ottawa Centre and then weave into the community of the member for Ottawa–Vanier, the Attorney General, and then into Ottawa–Orléans.", "This project is the single largest public infrastructure project in the city of Ottawa since the building of the Rideau Canal. It just shows you the significance of this project, and how much it’s going to redefine our city for years and years to come, because our government is investing in this very important project.", "We are also, of course, helping to expand bike paths and improve pedestrian walkways across the city. That complements well with the building of the LRT.", "The other very large infrastructure project that is taking place in my community, which impacts the entire city of Ottawa, is the building of an addition to the Ottawa heart institute. It’s a state-of-the-art medical facility providing specialized heart care, not just in Ottawa but entire eastern Ontario. We’re investing $200 million in building a brand new expansion extension to the heart institute, with six brand new heart surgery operating rooms. It is, again, going to revolutionize the delivery of health care when it comes to heart health in our community.", "I want to thank all the people who work at the Ottawa heart institute for their incredible work and diligence in helping us live healthy lives.", "The other project that is extremely important to my community, and again benefits the entire city of Ottawa, is the building of Innovation Centre. Our government is investing over $15 million in the building of Innovation Centre. This is going to be Ottawa’s equivalent of Communitech in Kitchener-Waterloo—a place of incubation; a place where we bring our entrepreneurs, our innovators, our students and all the other experts together, so that they can create the next big breakthrough.", "We’re working very closely with the city of Ottawa and Invest Ottawa, which is our economic development agency in the city of Ottawa, in developing Innovation Centre at Bayview Yards.", "All these three investments are critical in helping to make my community of Ottawa Centre and our city of Ottawa—in fact, Speaker, I would argue, all of Ontario—the best place to live, work and raise a family.", "I’m excited that we are now going to be investing over $130 billion in public infrastructure over the next 10 years. That is just incredible, to see the kind of emphasis that our government is putting on building public infrastructure that will benefit every single community that we all have the privilege of representing.", "These investments will build much-needed infrastructure in every corner of the province and will support over 110,000 jobs annually. Experts agree: Investing in our infrastructure is an investment in our economy and in our future.", "An April 2013 report from the Conference Board of Canada found that each dollar invested in public infrastructure in Ontario raises the gross domestic product by $1.14 in the near term. In addition, our own studies show that the returns on this dollar grow to $3.10 in the long term while supporting jobs and facilitating private investment. That’s a three-time increase as a result of investments in public infrastructure.", "Bill 6, if passed, would require our government and future governments to regularly prepare long-term infrastructure plans. This will ensure that all governments recognize the importance of long-term planning for infrastructure.", "The Infrastructure for Jobs and Prosperity Act is part of our plan to continue building a well-educated and highly skilled workforce. The proposed legislation would increase the opportunities for apprenticeships for a wide variety of trades.", "As the Minister of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure has stated in the House before, our government was willing to accept amendments from the opposition and stakeholders to strengthen this important legislation. Bill 6 is now a stronger piece of legislation because of our collaborative work during the committee process. There are now provisions in this legislation around social housing, health and safety, accessibility and asset management, to name a few.", "Speaker, I will conclude by stating that this bill represents our government’s key priorities: to build Ontario up by investing in people’s talents and skills, building new public infrastructure across the province and creating a dynamic business climate. I sincerely hope that all members of this House will support this important legislation during third reading." ],

I want to thank them. Normally, within our caucus, the critic for the bill—in that case, me—would have been subbed in on the committee, but because the committee was time allocated and the committee met on the Monday of this week and the previous Monday for public hearings, I, of course, Mr. Speaker, was in the Chair. We’re doing double duty many days here, trying to get it all done, and I want to express my thanks to my colleagues who are actually the members of that committee for our party, generally speaking. They carried on and did the work in committee.", "There were public hearings. The minister who I follow, the government House leader, indicated that there were hearings. Yes, there were, and at the same time, I want to acknowledge the work that has been done by my colleague the member for Dufferin–Caledon. She has been assertively bringing forward the idea that we need to do more to recycle aggregates. There was actually an amendment to Bill 6 that was passed by the committee. It’s now section 9.1: “Infrastructure planning and investment should endeavour to make use of acceptable recycled aggregates.” Again, this is an amendment that was based largely on work that was done by the member for Dufferin–Caledon, and she deserves enormous credit. I think we need to recognize the opportunity that recycled aggregates represent and ensure that that opportunity is reflected in this legislation.", "Bill 6, the Infrastructure for Jobs and Prosperity Act, 2014: This bill, if passed, enacts the Infrastructure for Jobs and Prosperity Act, 2014. The bill would enshrine a series of principles, requirements and authorities to promote improvement in infrastructure planning in the province of Ontario.", "As you know, Mr. Speaker, the provincial government, in the absence of Bill 6, brought forward recently a long-term infrastructure plan. That was, I think, appreciated by the people of Ontario whose projects were referenced in the plan.", "We pointed out at second reading that, in fact, the government was able to do that work before the election in the absence of Bill 6. So there’s nothing stopping them from bringing forward a long-term infrastructure plan, even if Bill 6 doesn’t pass. But, certainly, the government wants to appear to be committed to ensuring that there is, on an ongoing basis going forward, long-term infrastructure planning, hence the need for Bill 6.", "The government, in Bill 6, outlines a number of specific principles upon which infrastructure plans would be developed. That has been thoroughly canvassed, I think, in the second reading debate. But, certainly, as I said, as the official opposition, we support the idea of long-term infrastructure planning for the province of Ontario.", "The government tells us they’re committed to a $130-billion long-term infrastructure plan over 10 years. We see, in this year’s provincial budget, the government, in its capital plan, is committing to an expenditure on infrastructure of $13.536 billion. That’s maybe where you get the $130-billion figure—times 10. The government is committed to around $13.5 billion in infrastructure, when you look at the list; for example, about $2.5 billion on provincial highways, $2.7 billion on hospital infrastructure, $1.9 billion on education infrastructure; justice, $243 million. So, of course, the government has committed in the provincial budget to this kind of expenditure.", "I think it’s therefore reasonable for us, as members of the opposition, to point out some of the infrastructure needs that we have in our ridings. This is something that I’ve repeatedly raised in the Legislature on a number of occasions over the last several years now, and that is the need for the government to put the Highway 6 Morriston bypass project on the five-year plan for capital construction for highways." ],

I’ve raised it in the Legislature; I’ve raised it in committee.", "We have put together something called the Morriston Bypass Coalition, which had a number of meetings in recent months with key officials within the government, including senior staff and several of the ministries.", "The Morriston Bypass Coalition is a group of businesses, chambers of commerce and municipalities: Con Cast Pipe, Sleeman, Guelph Chamber of Commerce, Canada Bread, the Private Motor Truck Council of Canada, Nestlé Waters, Tim Hortons, Maple Leaf, the Freight Management Association of Canada, Fluke Transportation Group, the Grain Farmers of Ontario, the Hamilton Port Authority, the city of Hamilton, the Hamilton international airport, the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce, Cargill, the county of Wellington, the Ontario Trucking Association, the Southern Ontario Gateway Council, the township of Puslinch, the city of Guelph and, of course, the county of Wellington.", "They have done a good economic analysis of the need to proceed with this project, and we are currently waiting to hear back from the Minister of Transportation on a recent request that we have made. We know that after the budget has passed—and, of course, the budget bill passed in the House this morning. The Ministry of Transportation now knows what its capital allocation is going to be for new highway construction in the year ahead. When they have that information, they’re in a position to look at modifications to the five-year capital plan—the southern highways program, as the ministry calls it. Each year, they do projects that are on that plan, and that makes room for new projects to be added.", "I would, again, respectfully request to the minister that he, as soon as possible, agree to meet with the township of Puslinch council representative—hopefully, the county of Wellington could be represented at that meeting, as well as the Morriston Bypass Coalition—so that he could hear for himself the important urgency of this project. I would hope that he would be in a position, then, to add it to the five-year plan of the ministry.", "I want to, again, talk about the economic study that was done by the township of Puslinch—Mayor Dennis Lever and the township council and staff who took the lead on this to get this done. There was a report that was prepared by Dr. Clarence Woudsma of the University of Waterloo, which underlined the need to move forward with the Morriston bypass. The study included reference to the current traffic logjams through Morriston, which are costing commuters tens of millions of dollars every year, and the commercial traffic costs are in the millions of dollars annually. This report documented that the economic cost of the current logjam that exists through the hamlet of Morriston, in the township of Puslinch.", "I also want to again remind the government that the Premier herself, in question period in July, implicitly acknowledged the importance of the Morriston bypass project. I had raised it in the Legislature the previous day, and in response to a question from our Leader of the Opposition, she said she felt that the issue I had raised the previous day was an important priority. As a former Minister of Transportation, we know—hopefully—that she has an understanding of the transportation needs of the province, perhaps better than some, and she would, hopefully, want her Minister of Transportation to follow through on this implicit statement that she made, that it should be made a priority. Again, I would ask the minister to do that.", "Again, the Highway 6 Morriston bypass needs to be added to the Ministry of Transportation’s five-year plan for new highway construction. Again, the Premier has acknowledged that the project is needed. The Morriston Bypass Coalition includes the township of Puslinch, the county of Wellington, the cities of Guelph and Hamilton, as well as chambers of commerce and prominent businesses such as Tim Hortons, Maple Leaf Foods, Nestlé Waters, Sleeman Brewery, Canada Bread, and Cargill.", "Again, the township of Puslinch has done their homework, as was requested by a previous Minister of Transportation, who, of course, now serves as the Minister of Energy, who suggested that they put together this business coalition and study the economic impact. This has been done, and it is now finally up to the government to respond.", "Another important infrastructure priority in our riding is the need for a new courthouse in Halton region. The existing courthouse in Milton was built more than 50 years ago. It’s no longer adequate to meet the needs of one of the province’s fastest-growing areas.", "I have had the opportunity to visit and tour the courthouse myself, and I encouraged the court users to also invite the other Halton-area MPPs, who subsequently had an opportunity to tour the Halton courthouse and see for themselves. We’ve tried to work together, across the aisle, setting aside partisanship, to advocate with the Attorney General on the need for a new courthouse. I think all of us—the member for Halton, the member for Burlington, and the member for Oakville, who serves as the Minister of Labour—are in agreement that this needs to be a priority.", "I’ve raised this in the Legislature in question period. The Attorney General indicated again that—she said it was a priority. We’re trying to find out what that means. Obviously, we would have expected some greater commitment in the provincial budget. It wasn’t there, but we continue to identify that as a priority, as local MPPs, and we will continue to do so until the government finally does the right thing.", "I would also want to acknowledge the good work that has been done by Halton regional council and Halton regional chair Gary Carr. They have worked hard to raise this issue with the government.", "Courthouse users, including judges, lawyers and staff, and all of us, as I said—the Halton-area MPPs, the four of us—are behind the project. We would identify that as a priority in our area and urge the government to respond and announce that a new courthouse has been approved, and then proceed with the planning for it, and then we would look forward to seeing it built.", "I’m pleased that the Minister of Education is in the House today. I would again call to her attention the need for a new Holy Cross Catholic school in Georgetown. In 2013, the Holy Cross Catholic school in Georgetown was the Halton Catholic District School Board’s number one priority that they submitted to the government. They had a number of conversations with the minister, and I raised it in the House on a number of occasions. They put together a good business case. But unfortunately, they were not successful in getting approval for a replacement school.", "I have had the opportunity to visit this particular school. I’ve toured it, I think, three times or maybe four times, working with the local school board trustee, Mark Rowe, who does a great job. The school was built in the late 1950s. It’s currently in a deteriorating condition. A recent facility condition survey indicated that the building will require over $5 million in repairs over the next eight years, to maintain it in an acceptable condition.", "Then there is also insufficient room on the current site to expand the school, to support anticipated population growth in Georgetown. So even if they don’t get approval for a new school, they’re going to have to spend $5 million just to maintain it in an acceptable condition for the foreseeable future, for the next eight years.", "Certainly, the school board wants to go ahead and build a new replacement school. I tried to do everything I can, as a member of the Legislature, to draw attention to this issue, working with the school board trustee and the local school board, and I will continue to do so.", "I’m also privileged to represent the town of Erin. The town of Erin’s waste water management system is an important infrastructure project on the horizon in our riding. The town of Erin has been working for years on a servicing and settlement master plan—they call it the SSMP—and an environmental assessment appears to be the next step. The town of Erin is probably the largest southern Ontario community without a communal waste water management system. They still have septics in their backyards, and we need to move ahead to modernize the waste water treatment in that community.", "The lack of a sewage system and communal waste water treatment system is impacting the town’s ability to attract commercial and industrial investment and, currently, it’s forcing ratepayers to pay increasingly higher taxes. But the town cannot afford to build this system without the support of the provincial government. According to published reports, the potential capital costs to provide sewage treatment/sanitary services for both Erin and Hillsburgh are estimated to be as much as $58 million, with annual operating costs of $900,000.", "The town of Erin currently has a population of around 11,000 people, and approximately 4,500 people live in Hillsburgh and the former village of Erin. They need to move ahead with this project, but they cannot move ahead without substantial financial support from the province of Ontario. This is something that we’ve raised in the Legislature on a number of occasions now in the context of this discussion on Bill 6, and I will continue to raise it until we receive a satisfactory response.", "Also in the town of Erin, we have a situation that has arisen in recent years: the Station Road bridge. The Station Road rehabilitation is an urgent project due to significant safety concerns. This is in the hamlet of Hillsburgh, in my riding. Station Road is located on top of an earthen berm which creates a dam. There’s also a bridge within the dam to allow the Upper Credit River to pass underneath the road. There are significant structural concerns with the dam, and a hazard assessment recently done identified a high hazard potential should the dam collapse. There’s also a fire station located adjacent to the bridge, and when the road was closed previously, an incident occurred which delayed emergency response, and nobody wants this to happen again. The Station Road bridge has been identified by the Credit Valley conservation authority as a safety concern.", "The Ministry of Natural Resources has issued a temporary permit for the repair of the failed culvert, which requires a permanent solution to the entire dam situation. An article that appeared in August 2014 in the Wellington Advertiser indicated that the town had received an 18-month extension from the Ministry of Natural Resources to come up with a permanent solution. So the clock is ticking. It’s almost a year now since that edict came down from the ministry. Of course, the town council and the town staff want to do something, and they’ve come to my office to discuss it with me. I’ve written the government many times seeking financial support from the province for the town of Erin for this project, and I’ve been advised that the town cannot complete the project without “the financial assistance of other levels of government.”", "The town of Erin sought funding under the ministry’s small, rural and northern infrastructure capital program, but they’ve been denied funding. They were told that their expression of interest did not pass the pre-screening process because other applicants had “highly critical projects” with “more challenging economic conditions.”", "This is totally unacceptable to me. It’s totally unacceptable to the people of the town of Erin and the council. I think there has to be room for support from the provincial government for a project like this, especially when the provincial government is ordering the town to deal with it within an 18-month time frame and, of course, at the same time denying them the financial support they need to make it happen.", "I would also like to talk about GO Transit service. In December 2008, I tabled a private member’s resolution calling upon the government to extend GO train service to include stops in Acton, Kitchener and Waterloo by September 2011. Again, it was in 2008 that I brought that forward in this Legislature. While the new service was finally operational in January 2012—in fact, Mr. Speaker, I had the chance to ride that first train from Acton to Toronto and Union Station to come to work that day—there are only two trains in the morning and two in the evening. There are six in the morning from Georgetown and six in the afternoon, but only two trains morning and afternoon serving the community of Acton.", "During the lead-up to the most recent provincial election campaign, the government promised full-day, two-way GO train service between Waterloo region and the GTA. However, their promise at that time lacked details and no specific time frame was committed to. When the House resumed sitting in July, after the provincial election, I raised this in the Legislature in the form of a private member’s resolution; actually on the very first day it was possible to do so, the day of the throne speech. I asked the rhetorical question: How does the government define full-day, two-way service? Does it mean trains every hour through the day, every half-hour? And what is the time frame? I tabled that resolution, and it continues to be one of the top three private members’ notices of motion on the order paper.", "Subsequent to that, and in response to a series of questions from our opposition critic for transportation, the member for Kitchener–Conestoga, we were informed that it might take as many as 10 years before this commitment will be achieved, and that is apparently the government’s commitment now. During the election campaign, I don’t think anybody expected that it would take 10 years. And while it’s fair to say that they weren’t giving us a specific time frame, to suggest it was going to take 10 years was not something they told us at that time. I commend my colleague the member from Kitchener–Conestoga for at least getting that much information, but we would encourage the government to proceed more expeditiously than that and get this done as quickly as possible.", "I also want to mention, because it has come up at meetings with the Ontario Federation of Agriculture this week, another initiative that I brought forward in the Legislature with respect to high-speed Internet. There are still large parts of the province, particularly in rural Ontario, that do not have access to high-speed Internet; at least high-speed Internet that’s affordable. The Internet service in rural Ontario is often slow, unreliable and expensive, and there are some residents of Ontario who still have no alternative but dial-up Internet.", "I would say that reliable access to high-speed Internet is essential in today’s economy. Whether you own a farm, run a business or use the Internet at home, we all depend on being connected. This is another issue I have raised, and will continue to raise in the House, trying to get the government to bring forward a provincial strategy to ensure that all residents of Ontario have access to affordable high-speed Internet.", "There are a number of other projects.", "In conclusion, I need to acknowledge the fact that the government, in its budget, has reinstated the Connecting Links Program. It was something our party called for, for a long time, and I want to express my appreciation for that. I wish I had more time, Mr. Speaker, because I’ve got a long list of projects that I’d like to talk about." ],

Bill 6 falls under that umbrella. Bill 6 is the Infrastructure for Jobs and Prosperity Act. In my briefing notes, I have written down here, “It’s all very nice, but where’s the beef?” Essentially what we’ve come to think about this bill is that it is yet another bill to create a plan to be able to create more plans, similar to the bill we discussed this morning, the Great Lakes Protection Act.", "Nevertheless, we can’t fault the government for trying to prioritize or put some emphasis on the importance of infrastructure-building in the province of Ontario. In fact, they have staked a lot of ground on it: roughly $130 billion worth over the next 10 years. It always amazes me that a government can project 10 years into the future, in terms of what they’re going to spend, assuming that they’re going to be here in perpetuity. Why don’t you make your plan 100 years in advance and tell us you’re going to spend a trillion dollars? It’s quite interesting.", "However, they’re going to spend $130 billion or so, which roughly equates to about $13 billion per year, on infrastructure in the province of Ontario. Undoubtedly, we know we that need it. There’s a deficit in infrastructure. I would submit to the government: Why don’t you start by stopping to waste so much money on public-private partnerships? You’ve wasted $8.2 billion over the last nine years. Don’t take my word for it, Speaker. Take the word of the auditor. There are lots of reports. If the members want to take the time to actually read the reports from the Auditor General, she clearly states that $8.2 billion has been essentially vaporized under the watch of this government when it comes to funding and financing infrastructure projects. Our concern is that this will allow them to plan to vaporize more of that money.", "We would like to see them take a more prudent approach to planning, and maybe this is what, hopefully, gives them that opportunity, unlike what we heard, I guess, prior to the last election. We heard the government and several ministers tout their plan to develop and to bring about the high-speed rail network between Toronto and Montreal. Speaker, this was brought about with much fanfare. It was a promise to bring in new high-speed rail. It was unfunded. I remember it was just prior to the election. They were going to bring people from London to Toronto to Montreal. It would only cost half a billion dollars, be ready within 10 years and cost within $10 a ride. What a stretch. What an incredible stretch.", "And then we reminded them that we would like some high-speed rail between Windsor and London. They said, “Okay. We’ll throw that in too as well,” just as a teaser. It made quite a joke of their ability to plan and to really understand what the needs are of our community. That’s why we are supportive of this. We hope it actually gives them a road map and the ability to project and to take into consideration municipal concerns, municipal needs, economic development concerns, the status of our infrastructure as it is—a whole host of things.", "Speaker, I sat on the committee just this week in which we had some amendments to the bill. There were two recurring themes. One was the specific prescription about apprenticeships being allocated within the context of building public infrastructure projects. The government has proposed a quota system. As much as I understand and appreciate the need to bring apprentices online, a quota system on a hard measure potentially will not work. I would much rather take the government’s direction on this and what they have implemented through the College of Trades, which is the ratios that are currently brought about through the College of Trades. That is what has been done, as we are aware. They did turn around on the quota system. Now it will be factored in through the College of Trades. I truly appreciate that that change has been made.", "The second recurring theme was one which many community members requested. Those who are involved in community development, community engagement and economic development requested that the government make consideration for the use of a community benefits plan, something that would be structured, targeted, something that had a model that those community partners could be involved in specifically, a direct pipeline, as it were, to infrastructure projects, to talk about how they can bring about new jobs for new immigrants, for those with disabilities, those who have not ever worked in that sector, and then address the apprenticeship issue. They were paid lip service too, Speaker—", "Interjections." ],

I just wanted to get your attention, because this is really important, what I’m talking about right here.", "The community groups were talking about a community benefits plan. They were paid lip service by the government, actually. They were not given a community benefits plan. They were told that inherent in infrastructure planning and development are community benefits. You can see them. There are jobs. You can dig up sewers and there are jobs associated with that. People are spending money. But that doesn’t actually deliver on what these folks were talking about. They were talking about a structured, measurable plan that had targets, benchmarks and thresholds.", "I guess we’re not going to see that through, so they’ve ultimately let down many community groups that made a good business plan for the involvement and implementation of community benefits plans within the bill.", "Speaker, talking about apprenticeships, we know that we need to make a serious effort to bring new skilled trades and young workers into the skilled trades and to keep them here. Not only is there a demand side for skilled trades, but unfortunately, there has been an exodus of skilled trades to other jurisdictions. We’ve raised that alarm. Many have talked about the need to enhance the apprenticeship program and the supports that are given to apprentices.", "What has the government’s answer been to that need and to the demand that is in place? In the 2015 Ontario budget, the changes to the Apprenticeship Training Tax Credit, the ATTC—here’s how they’re going to respond to it—are going to decrease the general tax credit rate from 35% to 25%. That’s not really going to help bring new apprentices online. It decreases the tax credit rate for small businesses, with salaries or wages under $400,000 per year, from 45% to 30%, so they are no longer incentivized to bring on apprentices. They’re cutting there again.", "It decreases the annual maximum credit for each apprentice from $10,000 to $5,000. That directly affects those apprentices who are able to deduct the costs and fees to their apprenticeship program.", "Fourth, it reduces the eligibility period from the first 48 months of an apprenticeship program to the first 36 months of an apprenticeship program.", "Again, they talk a lot of game about enhancing and supporting apprentices in the province of Ontario. At the same time, the 2015 Ontario budget makes some drastic cuts to what we currently have under our apprenticeship regime. We don’t understand the logic there.", "Again, the bill essentially is a bill that creates a plan to be able to create a plan. I don’t know if that makes sense to anybody. Certainly, it doesn’t really make sense to us, especially given that there’s nothing that prohibits the government, especially a majority government, from creating a plan today. They can create a 10-year plan, a 20-year plan, or they can create a 100-year plan. There is absolutely nothing that stops them from doing it. However, they felt the need to be able to have to structure themselves, so let’s see them do that.", "They’ve had different plans before. One of the plans is called the southern highways plan. Built into that southern highways plan are different infrastructure projects in the south that communities have identified that need to be done. They are not yet prioritized; some of them actually are, but some of them have been on the books for quite some time.", "One of them, the Highway 3 bypass, in my riding of Essex, passed environmental assessment in 2006 and has been on the plan since 2006. It is a highway in Essex that is two-thirds done. It’s completed two thirds of the way, from Windsor to Leamington, in its widening and expansion.", "It’s a highway that was long championed by my predecessor, Bruce Crozier. He spent 19 years in this place. I would submit and argue that of the 19 years—and he sat on the government for many of those years—he spent the majority of his time lobbying the government to actually start this project and then see it to its completion. Unfortunately, he passed several years ago. Actually, you know what? If memory serves me correctly, he passed two years ago today." ],

We have the Herb Gray Parkway, a $1.8-billion infrastructure program that will link the 401 to the new Detroit River crossing, which will be called, as we now know, the Gordie Howe bridge, as Stephen Harper decided it would be named. Why not call it the Tim Hortons bridge or something? I don’t know, but he decided to call it the Gordie Howe bridge.", "We have the Herb Gray Parkway, a massive infrastructure program. It’s been transformative for our community. It’s changed the landscape drastically. We know that it will improve, eventually, the flow of goods and services across our border, and we know that it will eventually support economic development.", "However, despite the enormity of the price tag on that project, our region, in Windsor and Essex county—our unemployment remains unacceptably high. It’s around 11.5%. The government claims that the $13 billion per year will be the panacea of job creation and economic development, and undoubtedly it does; however, they’ve got to do a lot more strategic thinking in terms of what they put into place for economic development. We need an automotive strategy. We need an agriculture strategy. We need a local procurement strategy. These are all things that the government can no longer take a laissez-faire approach to when it comes to supporting our economies. They have to actually be on the job. Unfortunately, we’ve seen them outsource many of those vital components to other entities, and it’s got them into a lot of trouble.", "This is, again, about creating a plan. If it is to be that, I certainly support it. If it is a plan that is bulletproof and something that cannot be tampered with, and something that brings in broad consultation with various stakeholders—specifically municipalities—we are happy to support that initiative and to see it well-nuanced so that it really addresses our highest-priority needs.", "Unfortunately, up to this date, we, again, have seen the government utilize infrastructure as the carrot, so to speak. Whether it be pre-election or post-election, at any given time they will dangle various infrastructure projects in front of communities, I believe, and I would say more so for political benefit than for the practicality of it.", "One of which, I will remind members—I don’t know who in this chamber at this moment actually canvassed and campaigned in Sudbury in the most recent by-election, but I can—yes, I see one hand over there. Do you remember your government proposing and promising that they were going to finish Maley Drive? What a melee you guys have created with that. You campaigned on it.

We will see what that plan is, going forward. The government has staked a lot of ground on it. Let’s ensure that all stakeholders are duly consulted and a broad segment of the public gets to actually have their voice heard when it comes to prioritizing these infrastructure projects in our communities.

I’m very pleased to rise in the House for the third reading of Bill 6, the proposed Infrastructure for Jobs and Prosperity Act. Indeed, one of the reasons why I chose to run for a seat in this House was to ensure that we had a government that would continue the momentum of investing in the much-needed infrastructure that this province requires.", "At the heart of it, Bill 6 is about applying the expertise we’ve gained over the past decade as we move forward with the next generation of infrastructure investment. I see infrastructure investment as one of the most direct forms of economic development that a government can engage in. Building modern infrastructure is directly linked to building a competitive economy.", "For instance, a 2013 Conference Board of Canada report found that each dollar invested in public infrastructure in Ontario raises GDP by $1.14 in the near term. Our own studies show that each dollar invested in infrastructure more than triples our return on investments in the long term. But unfortunately, for too long Ontario has relied on infrastructure that was outdated and deteriorating.", "Since 2003, our government has invested nearly $100 billion on infrastructure, focusing on what makes our communities stronger: assets like hospitals, schools and transportation infrastructure. In the past decade we’ve built 23 new hospitals, and 650 new schools have opened or are under construction. That is a tremendous record of achievement.", "We’re currently constructing 11 major hospital projects across the province, and we’ve expanded or rehabilitated over 9,100 kilometres of highways. That’s more than the distance from Toronto to Vancouver and back. Together we’ve built or repaired over 950 bridges across this province. We’ve accomplished a lot, but we recognize that there is still much more that needs to be done. That’s why our government is investing an unprecedented $130 billion in infrastructure in the next decade. This is the largest infrastructure investment our province has ever seen.", "Unlike the opposition, who say they support infrastructure but have no concrete plan to fund it and have consistently voted against budget measures that would fund it, the Premier announced our plan to unlock the value of certain public assets to help support investments in transit, transportation and other priority infrastructure projects. Together with other asset optimization strategies, this will provide us with $5.7 billion; that’s about $2.6 billion more from asset optimization than we had previously assumed. This increase of $2.6 billion brings our unprecedented investments in Moving Ontario Forward from $29 billion to $31.5 billion over the next 10 years. That’s going to help communities like Etobicoke–Lakeshore, Hamilton, Mississauga, Brampton, Kitchener-Waterloo, Ottawa and many others.", "Just as asset optimization is part of our long-term infrastructure plan, moving forward with Bill 6 is part of the same path forward to ensure Ontario has the infrastructure it needs to promote a modern economy and build a dynamic business climate. At this legislation’s core, Bill 6 is about enshrining solid principles for long-term infrastructure planning in Ontario to guide our path forward. I note that the member for Essex spoke about the need for this type of approach.", "Under the proposed legislation, the government must prepare a long-term infrastructure plan that covers at least 10 years. Mr. Speaker, the rigour of this process will ensure that the needs of our changing province are reflected in our infrastructure planning.", "I’m very proud to say that during the committee process, we’ve strengthened the legislation by adopting amendments from both stakeholders and the official opposition, though I do wish to note for the record that the third party, the NDP, did not bring forward any amendments." ],

I think that’s a very important step forward, and I can only hope that when the federal government decides to invest significantly in infrastructure, they will invest in social housing as well. This will accurately reflect in legislation the importance that we place on the building of social housing as infrastructure. Since 2003, our government has committed over $4 billion to affordable housing, which is the largest investment of its kind in the province’s history. Including social housing in the definition will encourage future governments—and as I said, I dare say the federal government—to take this type of infrastructure investment seriously.", "We also amended the legislation to ensure that consideration to accessibility is incorporated when we build infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, today is the 10th anniversary of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act. I cannot think of a better day to remind MPPs and Ontarians collectively that we must constantly think about how we can improve accessibility in the province. This amendment to Bill 6 is one of the many changes we need to make in the coming decade.", "One concept that was raised numerous times during public hearings was that of community benefits. I’m very encouraged that all parties agreed to accept an amendment that infrastructure planning and investment should promote social and economic benefits for local communities. As MPPs, we’re all focused on improving our constituencies, and this amendment will encourage local benefits from local infrastructure projects. Unlike the assertion that the member from Essex made, in fact, this government is entering into community benefit agreements on various projects throughout the province. We will be using that as a tool in future infrastructure planning to ensure that communities, that young people, that people seeking employment get the full benefit of the infrastructure projects being built in their communities.", "In consultation with the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, we also accepted an amendment that will allow the government to create regulations requiring municipalities or any other broader public sector entity to develop asset management plans. This builds on the work that we’ve been doing with municipalities to prioritize infrastructure through asset management planning. Now we will have the ability to standardize asset management planning, which is necessary to realize the full value of this work.", "As we move forward on this, we’ll continue to consult significantly with municipalities to ensure these regulations are crafted to improve municipalities’ ability to deliver on their infrastructure needs. This is not only good planning, it’s good business practice and it’s nothing less than what the taxpayers of this province would expect from all levels of government.", "We also adopted an amendment that recognizes the crucial role that the professional engineers in Ontario play in implementing the government’s infrastructure investments. This amendment creates equal authorities for both professional engineers and architects. And we improved the legislation to promote apprentices. We did this through the committee process. This legislation encourages—I’m tripping over my remarks here, Mr. Speaker. What I meant to say—I wanted to continue on the issue of design professionals.", "This legislation encourages the broader use of architects and other design professionals to be used in large-scale infrastructure projects so we might derive further value from the money that we’re spending on infrastructure, to improve urban design, landscape design, the resiliency and the durability of these infrastructure projects that we are building.", "On the issue of apprentices, we are moving to a plan-based approach. I believe we’ve now struck the right balance of promoting apprentice training while at the same time taking into consideration the industry’s concerns.", "Today we have a situation where many young people face great challenges in finding stable, well-paying jobs, and meanwhile there are shortages in many of the skilled technical trades. The skills training and apprenticeship provision in Bill 6 is a smart and strategic way to help close this gap.", "Lastly, Mr. Speaker—and, maybe the official opposition will argue, most importantly—we adopted a PC amendment that will consider the use of recycled aggregates for infrastructure projects. Our government understands the economic and environmental benefits for considering recycled aggregates for infrastructure projects, and this amendment will ensure that recycled aggregates are considered as part of infrastructure planning and investment. I do want to thank members of the PC caucus for bringing this forward as a very good submission to the process.", "Our government views Bill 6 as a landmark piece of legislation in helping to shape Ontario’s future. I encourage all members of the House to support this legislation.", "As I said at the outset, one of the key reasons why I decided to run as a member of provincial Parliament is that I saw the damage that was done to my community, to my city, to my region through the lack of infrastructure investment: a transit system that was outdated and underserving the communities; roads, highways, bridges that were falling apart or were not keeping up with demand; schools that were deteriorating; and a lack of health infrastructure for the future. So I ran to support a government that is investing in this. I ran because this is a government that is supporting the people and businesses of Ontario by providing the key infrastructure that’s going to ensure that this province is a wonderful place to invest in and to continue to live, work and play in.", "Interjections." ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, good afternoon. Again, may I say I’m humbled to be able to stand in this House, as one of 107 voices in this Legislature, to have the privilege to speak to this bill.", "I spent 35 or 40 minutes speaking to the bill yesterday morning, and by way of a brief summary, just to bring you up to date, a lot of what I had to say then was about inclusionary zoning, and that’s a major way that I thought this Bill 73 could be improved. Municipalities that wish to create more affordable housing could use inclusionary zoning as a tool when developers come into the planning department to apply for new housing developments. You can establish your goals—for the sake of argument, say, 10%. If you want to build a 100-unit development, you might have to set aside 10 units and make them available to qualified people who need affordable housing, from an established waiting list.", "We can debate whether 10% is too high or too low, but I believe the principle is sound on inclusionary zoning and it’s something we should all take a look at. As we all know, there are just too many people in Ontario looking for safe and affordable housing. Inclusionary zoning could solve some of that problem—not all of it, Speaker. There are so many other things out there. But this bill would really be something to brag about, really something to hold up to the rest of the country, if, finally, the government did more than just listen to the argument on inclusionary zoning and actually added something in here to address the problem of the lack of housing.", "There’s a crisis in affordable housing, and it’s something we should be addressing. It’s only going to get worse. The municipal housing stock across the province is really starting to crumble. No matter where you go, municipalities that provide subsidized housing and rent-geared-to-income housing—there hasn’t been a lot of money spent on maintaining these properties in recent years, and private landlords certainly aren’t rushing forward to build new housing stock for those who need it the most. They say that they would if they had more government partners with them on various schemes. We could create some more housing stock for people who need affordable housing and rent-geared-to-income housing, but private developers need incentives. They can’t do it on their own. I think that if you worked it the right way, inclusionary zoning is one of the incentives that could be used to address this problem.", "I also spent a good deal of my time yesterday outlining the need for real reform at the Ontario Municipal Board. I know they’ll be looking at it elsewhere, but I still think we could have seen more by way of OMB reform within this bill, because I believe you can’t fix planning problems in Ontario until you harness the extraordinary powers of the Ontario Municipal Board.", "There are other aspects of Bill 73, the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act, that we should be talking about this afternoon. As I said yesterday, there are a number of parts of this bill that are worth saying some nice things about, and I’ll do that at some point this afternoon.", "It’s easy to be critical. I guess that’s why they call us critics. If you’re the critic of a portfolio held by a minister, you’re expected, at some point, to stand up and criticize what’s on the table. On the other hand, it’s easy to say good things. I believe that if there are good things in a proposed bill, you should highlight those as well, and I will be doing that. It’s easy to state that you agree with something, just as it is easy to say, “I disagree.”", "Speaker, I mentioned to you that before becoming a New Democrat MPP, I was a member of city council in Windsor. One of the first committees I signed up for, as a councillor, was the planning advisory committee. I was very proud to serve for seven years on the PAC for the city of Windsor. I wanted to do that, because I always thought it was one of the most important committees that any municipality can have.", "Planning is really sneaking a peek into the future of your community. It’s a snapshot of what is to come, or it offers an idea of what could be possible. Don’t get me wrong: I know that we’ve all believed in projects that never developed and never got off the planning pages. They looked good on paper.", "I remember that years ago—Bill Davis was Premier; I think his friend was Gerhard Moog. They brought forth a proposal. You’ll appreciate this, member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore: It looked almost identical to Toronto city hall; you know, the dome and the towers. That was to be the new Holiday Inn on Windsor’s waterfront. We accepted, of course; the city of Windsor at the time did. But instead of that, we ended up with the Plywood Palace, a basic box. It stood there for many years until it burnt down. But what was accepted by the municipality later led the municipality to put in a lot of changes to make sure that in the future we would get what we were promised. At the time, we were promised this great vision, and we ended up with the Plywood Palace, as I say.", "I’m still waiting for some pretty imaginary proposals that were presented to city council. Even back when I was a reporter covering city hall and covering planning council advisory committee meetings, you would see these plans on paper and say, “Wow. Wouldn’t that be good?” But just because they were accepted didn’t mean they were going to be developed and built. Life gets in the way: A funder drops out, for some reason; priorities change. But, at least at the planning stage, there are sets of rules and guidelines, standards, statements that establish the parameters of what sort of proposal might fit into or onto a certain parcel of land.", "The way I see planners, I see them as the visionaries. They have the imagination to see what most of us can’t. For them, it’s more like a game of chess as opposed to us playing checkers." ],

Once those plans are set in place, they should be set in stone. This bill would establish criteria to delay challenges to official plans and policy statements, and I’ll speak to that a little bit later on as well.", "I will mention at this point that in Windsor we always made sure that non-elected representatives sat on the planning advisory committee. For many years, that was the way we did our business, and that’s part of this bill, that a non-elected member of the public and administration would sit on a municipal planning advisory committee. In fact, in Windsor our committee was chaired for many years by a non-elected person. Now, this changed somewhat when we adopted a new governance system and created more standing committees of council, but for me the principle was sound then and it’s sound today, that non-elected reps should be included on planning committees. This bill will see that this happens in all communities on a go-forward basis—of course, if it’s adopted and accepted.", "If we turn our attention to the section requiring a parks plan and the cash-in-lieu provisions of parkland dedication, no one seriously questions—I would hope no one seriously questions—the need for parkland in urban settings. We need our green space. We need our trees. We need our playgrounds. We need our dog parks. For most people, it’s just a basic quality-of-life thing. Official plans speak to this issue. And don’t forget, Speaker, developers are used to paying the price. No matter where they build, if they don’t have the land to develop parkland as part of their proposal, they’re used to and are required to put up cash in lieu of dedicating certain land for parkland; nothing new there. The money is supposed to go into a reserve account, and it’s supposed to be used to create parkland, hopefully nearby. That’s how it’s supposed to work. It doesn’t always, apparently, work out that way.", "Late last year, there was a bit of an exposé in Toronto on the Toronto situation. Those who write for a quarterly magazine and an online blog called Spacing blew the whistle on Toronto’s cash-in-lieu reserve fund. Sure, the money is collected from the developers, but for the most part, it just sits there earning interest. Now here’s an excerpt from that Spacing article I read. The quote is:", "“The city likes to boast about its open spaces, citing how its 1,600 parks and 600 km of trails encompasses 8,000 ha, or 13% of Toronto’s area. As every park entrance sign duly notes, Toronto is ‘a city within a park.’", "“Yet it’s become apparent that there simply aren’t enough parks within the city, or at least certain parts of the city. In areas of high growth, and the dense older neighbourhoods that abut them, the city of Toronto has largely failed to create new networks of parks and substantial public open spaces sufficient to accommodate the needs of tens of thousands of new apartment dwellers.”", "In this Spacing article, written by John Lorinc and Alex Steep, it was revealed that Toronto’s parkland acquisitions and development reserve fund stood at more than $248 million. Don’t get me wrong, Speaker; the city is spending some of that money, but because the land is so expensive in the areas where green space is needed the most, the parks get developed in other areas where the land is less expensive.", "This Spacing article also suggested that some people in the planning areas, in planning departments at city hall, warned against creating new parks because they couldn’t afford to maintain what they already had. I think that’s an issue that—I know I ran into that when I served as chair of the Essex Region Conservation Authority. We had a parkland land acquisition reserve fund, and yet some members didn’t want to spend it because we were having trouble maintaining what we had. There wasn’t always enough money to fix the boardwalks in certain parks or along the waterfronts or in our green water spaces. Some members, rightfully so, questioned why we would be buying more waterfront property to maintain if we couldn’t afford to maintain the conservation areas that we already had.", "So in the defence of those who say, “Why dedicate more parkland when you can’t look after what you already have?”—I’m sure they would point out that, for example, an acre of land in downtown Toronto goes for, what, somewhere between $30 million and $60 million? And, you know, to develop that—or just to find it, first of all; there’s not a lot of land out there for parkland these days.", "If the money isn’t being used, the flip side of that coin is that instead of the cash in lieu, then perhaps municipalities should just say to the developer, “We’re going to force you to acquire more land on your own and create this parkland on your own dime,” instead of paying the city so many cents on the dollar for not providing it.", "Let me say some nice things about Bill 73 for a moment. Now, I’ll say off the top, I like the bill, I’ll be supporting it, but I do think it needs improvement. For example, it removes the arbitrary 10% discount that must be applied to transit-related growth, the growth costs when calculating development fees. It allows you to prescribe services where costs could be estimated based on future plans and not past policy. It pulls back the drapes, as we just talked about, on how the money collected in lieu of parkland is saved and spent; it makes that more transparent.", "Like I say, I’m not convinced with the aspect I’m not happy with at all—in one part of the bill, it reduces the parkland dedication payments from a rate of one hectare for every 300 residents to one for every 500. That weakens the intent, as far as I’m concerned.", "I referenced yesterday, for those that were here, the OMB’s weird ruling in Richmond Hill. This falls into that category, as far as I’m concerned. To refresh your memory, Speaker, the OMB overruled Richmond Hill’s elected council. They wanted developers to provide or pay cash in lieu of parkland when new developments were proposed. We all know we need the green space, as I’ve mentioned, and more of it, but the OMB ruled that there should be a cap on what a developer has to provide.", "I used the example of a cap working something like this. If you can, in your mind, just get a picture of a bit of green space, a small grassy park. If you can now picture 75 families having a picnic on this small property, and now, in your mind, get that picture, not of 75 families, but of 750 families on that same—", "Interjection." ],

Developers can appeal a specific section but not the entire plan. Municipalities will have more powers to protect what are called “employment areas.” It makes planning decisions more transparent by making approval authorities explain how written or oral submissions affected their final decision. It makes single- and upper-tier municipalities establish a planning advisory committee, which we talked about. And as I said, it insists that at least one member of those committees not be an elected or paid municipal official.", "Currently, provincial policy statements are updated every five years; this bill will change that to 10. Just like new official plans, they’ll be good for 10 years and updated every five years thereafter.", "Minister, like I said, there are some good points, and I can support the bill, but I think a lot of us on this side of the House would really like to see it improved in other areas, especially around the themes of real OMB reform and inclusionary zoning. I can’t believe that your Toronto-area members haven’t lobbied you personally for better language around inclusionary zoning. They’ll be the ones feeling the wrath of the voters because of the crisis that we know currently exists in Toronto when it comes to affordable housing.", "Minister, allow me to thank you once again for supporting the private member’s bill brought by the member for Essex, Mr. Natyshak, regarding the improvements to the Bruce Crozier highway. In my opinion, you, sir, have earned a ton of goodwill with your vote, as far as I’m concerned.", "I know you’ve got a whole bunch on your plate these days. You have your mandate letter. You’re reviewing plans on the greenbelt, the Oak Ridges moraine and the Niagara escarpment, and I sincerely hope that we won’t see much in the way of any degradation, any deterioration of land set aside and protected from future development, when those plans go through their review process. I think the farmland has to be protected. The green space has to be protected. I just hope, Minister, that the OMB doesn’t get involved and overrule all the good intentions of what most of us want to protect when it comes to those plans.", "I know the city of Toronto has some concerns about the bill. I won’t go into all of them. For example, we talk about the planning process and having a non-elected member on the planning advisory committee. As I understand it, in Toronto they have a much more mature, if you will, planning process, and they are, in their opinion, much more advanced than what is being proposed in the bill. I think they are asking for a clause allowing for exceptions to municipalities which can prove to the minister that his intent in some of these proposals has already been met, are being met in certain circumstances.", "And in some of Ontario’s municipalities, they’re doing much more than what is laid out in here, and that shouldn’t be held against them.", "Yesterday, the member from Oxford, the critic for the official opposition, spoke about my friend Dave Canfield, the mayor of Kenora. Ernie reminded us that the mayor’s office in Kenora is actually closer to the city of Calgary than it is to the city of Toronto, so when those that call these types of bills a cookie-cutter bill that we all have to come out of in the same kind of shape—there are other parts of the province. Toronto has Toronto’s issues, but other parts of the province have different issues, different restrictions, different ways of doing business that seem to be working, but if you come out with exceptions to some rule, that will cause problems for some.", "I know that I talked to my friends at AMO and we talked about the Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund—since we’re talking about strengthening municipalities. They were hoping that there wouldn’t be as much of a download, as much of a cutback in that fund, and I know the original cut has been somewhat diminished; it’s not as bad as it could have been, and I know that they’re very appreciative of that. But, again, municipalities are struggling. Even in my community of Windsor, when a factory closes down or a plant shuts down and they have this empty space—and it happens in the northern communities as well in logging mills and so on, when most of the plant is not being used or all of the plant is shut down. MPAC says, “Okay, now the value of the assessment on that property, that could be going to pay for the region’s tax base”—all of a sudden it’s negligence. When you lose, in a small community, $1 million or $2 million in an assessment, you’re really struggling to pay the bills and really struggling to keep on providing the services that we’ve all come to expect.", "Municipalities are struggling, Minister—I know you’re well aware of that—and we all know money is tight, not only in the province but with our municipal partners as well. Yesterday I mentioned the crumbling housing stock where Mayor John Tory is looking for $1.5 billion from federal and provincial partners. We know that hundreds of thousands of people are on the waiting lists for subsidized housing, let alone the people who are in there now.", "I know, Minister, you and I have talked about—I think it was in Medicine Hat, Alberta, they’re getting rid of the homelessness problem. Things happen in the rest of the country that we can look at here which would help with affordable housing as well. It takes money. I know sometimes it’s tough to get cabinet colleagues on the same page, no matter the portfolio.", "Just let me mention the private member’s bill, Bill 39, that the member for Etobicoke–Lakeshore has on the table.

I know the member from Windsor–Tecumseh touched a little bit on it, and that’s the part where we’re taking away some responsibilities from the municipalities. Quite the contrary: We are giving the municipalities more responsibility, more control. One is by certainly increasing the review of our official plan from five to 10 years, but the fact of amending that official plan—the member from Oxford yesterday said that municipalities would not be able to touch it for two years, and everybody else won’t be able to touch it. Frankly, municipalities and their elected councils are the only ones that will be able to make any amendments or suggest any amendments.

While I was mayor, we accumulated over 100 acres of wetland and built this most beautiful conservation area with boardwalks so people could walk through, and then we built an industrial park in a wetland. As businesses came, they built their business. Well, Bill 26 said, “Right across Ontario now, no more building on a wetland, even if you replace it.” We have a $40-million industrial park, fully serviced, that cannot be built on.

It will create an authority to identify services for which an alternative service level calculation would replace the historic 10-year average service level, and it will create an authority to identify ineligible services exclusively through regulation.", "The other piece we constantly hear concerns about in this chamber is about enhancing transparency and accountability. If passed, this legislation would require municipalities to reflect capital projects funded through development charges in a more detailed report. The other piece is, it will require development charges to link to municipal asset management planning.", "I hear all the time with regard to transparency, “What did they do with the development charges? Where did the money go?” More importantly, this particular legislation will restrict payment outside of the development charges regime for the capital costs associated with servicing new development and require municipal treasurers to certify that no payments have been received that are in contravention of this restriction.", "Furthermore, it will create an authority for the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing to investigate a municipality in relation to compliance with the act. Finally, this authority will allow the minister to investigate but also require the municipality to cover the costs of this compliance investigation. I think those extra teeth, as we often say, will force the municipality to be accountable and to be transparent, and they know the consequences if they’re not in compliance. At the end of the day, I’m sure no municipality wants to pay for that investigation.", "At the end of the day, I believe that we’ve heard very clearly that every member of the House will support little bits and pieces of this proposed legislation, Bill 73. I am sure that every member of this chamber would agree that, as we go to committee and more public hearings on Bill 73, we are going to get improvement of the proposed legislation.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m going to stop.

But congratulations for bringing forward a tremendous bill which will help so much in planning in Ontario.", "What I’m particularly interested in speaking to is this whole section 37 opportunity. As the member from Scarborough–Agincourt was saying, what you see so often in the city of Toronto, with the section 37 monies, is that it’s always sort of left in a vacuum about where they actually ended up going.", "In my neighbourhood, we’ve got a beautiful development at Dundas and Carlaw going up—Streetcar—where their section 37 money is going to a fantastic theatre, conditional on them getting additional extra funding for that development to make it whole. If that funding doesn’t come up, you always wonder: Then what happens to that section 37 money?", "What we know is going to happen with this bill is, it will be absolutely crystal clear, on a project-by-project basis, and on some level of an annual reporting at the municipal level, that all the section 37 monies that are collected are being used in the way that was intended and that was projected, so that there is an accountability to it.", "I think it speaks so much to how our party, this government, does go down this route to try to clarify, to bring accountability and oversight into decision-making, through all the boards and agencies that it operates within, and the municipalities, which are essentially creatures of the province.", "We go to the Ontario Municipal Board questions. The member from Windsor–Tecumseh talked about the private member’s bill of my colleague over here from Etobicoke–Lakeshore. The question came up: Why wasn’t this included as part of it?", "Of course, as was very clearly said by the minister, that’s part of a continuing review, which is coming forward. I’m sure, and I’m positive, that the very thoughtful insights that the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore has put into his thinking around the OMB, from his considerable experience at city hall, and as a trained architect and planner—no doubt, his considerable experience will be involved in populating what the right language and what the right opportunities are, with the Ontario Municipal Board.", "I remember, when we spoke to the member’s private member’s bill, Bill 39, that there was a very interesting exchange I had with the member from Oxford. In my community, it’s so important that we rein in how the Ontario Municipal Board works, because it tends to go overboard in reversing and rejecting plans that the neighbours and the citizens have put together with the municipality, whereas, in his view—he spoke at length about how they need the Ontario Municipal Board in order to correct misbegotten plans at the municipal level.", "There is almost a rural-urban split on how people perceive it. I’m confident that we’ll find the capacity to make sure we get the rules right, so that both rural and urban opportunities will be looked after.", "In the Beach, in Beaches–East York, I have sort of two different worlds: that which is south of Danforth, and that which is north of Danforth.", "South of Danforth, and you learn all through the election—it’s a beautiful community. They’re extraordinarily well organized, and they almost universally are organized around opposition to development. Or, maybe to put it more succinctly, they’re there to try to make sure development is right and it fits into the character of the neighbourhood.", "We have a group that we call the Greater Beach Neighbourhood Association, which is really an amalgam of 14 or 16 different residential associations in the south end, at Queen Street or at Kingston Road, Gerrard Street, and south of Danforth, where those communities often react to a development. They gather and they organize so that they can take matters to the OMB, to make sure they get the planning right.", "I believe this bill will help, because you’ll have planning advisory committees which will go to making sure that the secondary plans and the official plans, as they affect these individual neighbourhoods, are well thought out, so that when they go to the board, there won’t be an opportunity to overturn them, because they’ve got them right.", "We’ll also have local appeal bodies, so that many matters—within the Planning Act, we can’t change how the OMB operates, but we can change the kinds of things that it has oversight over. That’s what I think we’re doing—and doing very effectively—with this bill, so that local municipalities will have an appeal body, so that for some matters coming out of the committee of adjustment, it’s not necessary to go to the OMB. We can look at and deal with them where they are, at the local appeal level.", "With that, Speaker, I’d like to turn over the time to the member for Mississauga–Streetsville." ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, I’d like to begin with just a little anecdote. A number of years ago, I was at a seminar in the United States, and it was being conducted by a transit guru who had planned transit systems all over Asia and in parts of the United States, and he was talking about the preconditions necessary to effectively and economically, and in a timely manner, deliver transit projects on budget and on time. He said you can summarize these principles in three words: “Density is everything.” Density is something that stems from a good, well-supported municipal plan. One of the things that the province won an award for, almost 10 years ago, was in fact its own plan for Ontario. In this vein, I’m looking at some of the clauses that are proposed here in Bill 73.", "Very clearly, as a municipality develops and tries to implement things within that award-winning plan, which is called Places to Grow, one of the things that the GTA will do—which are very clear, if you have travelled in Europe or in Asia—is to densify. As soon as you propose densification, one of the things that you know at present is that you’re likely to run into an appeal to every conceivable board.", "Just to resolve some of these disputes—I’m just going to quickly run over a few of the measures that Bill 73 proposes. For example—and this may seem self-evident, but it isn’t the case now: Require appellants to provide clearer reasons for appeals. At the moment, you can take a municipality’s official plan and appeal it, really, without any basis, and you can take it one or two levels and then have your appeal dismissed and dismissed. All you do is basically say to the municipality, “You may get what you want, but we are going to be able to slow this thing down.” But if what you need is that density, to be able to build the kind of community that’s going to be a sustainable one, you’re hoping to yourself, “Would the province please give us the tools to ensure that people can’t appeal our municipal plan for reasons that are either meaningless or frivolous?” That’s one of the things that this plan does.", "It also removes the ability for appellants to appeal an entire new official plan. If you’re a municipality, one of the things that you’ve asked the province of Ontario is, “Can we have some sort of autonomy in choosing what developments happen within our borders?” There’s a series of checks and balances in doing development in the province of Ontario, but once we’ve achieved that compromise, one of the things this does is it says to people who wish to appeal it, “You can’t appeal the whole thing. You have to tell us what is in there that you don’t like, and you’ve got to show that you’ve got grounds for an appeal.”", "Hopefully, this should take some of the frivolous and vexatious cases away from the Ontario Municipal Board and from other forms of appeal, and also be able to resolve them and allow a city not merely to have control over development within its borders but to be able to get on with the job in a timely manner.", "It also provides enhanced opportunities for alternative dispute resolution. What that means, in very practical terms, is, does this actually have to go before an adjudicatory body? Must it go to a judge, a tribunal, the Ontario Municipal Board or anything equivalent? Is there a way that the parties can get together and, in the presence of an arbitrator, a mediator or whatever, come to a conclusion that this particular dispute either does or doesn’t have basis, and be able, in a cost-effective and a timely manner, to resolve it?", "If you’re sitting on a municipal council, you really want to read this bill, because there are a lot of things that you’re going to be looking at and saying, “Thank heavens. We’ve been asking for this for a long time.”", "Bill 73 is an important piece of legislation. I look forward to it getting speedy passage.", "I thank the Chair for his time." ],

We have buses in our community, but we don’t have mass transit. Most people rely on cars to move around. It’s a beautiful community. We have a number of developments that have recently been proposed for our community that would really shape or affect the communities to which they’ve been proposed. Developments in a community like Etobicoke Centre are something that have to be looked at very, very carefully because the community is a community that’s established and people enjoy a certain way of life. People have moved to that community because they value the quality of life in that community, and when developments get proposed, that can be very impactful on the local community and the quality of life.", "When I think about some of the developments that have recently been proposed in our community, I think about Humbertown plaza, which some of you may be familiar with, around Dundas and Royal York, where a developer applied to build a large condominium and retail complex. The Humber Valley Village Residents’ Association very effectively raised money, brought forward and advocated on behalf of the community and was able to negotiate a reduced development with the developer.", "I think about what’s happening now in Markland Wood, which is in the southwestern part of my riding, where a development has been proposed, and many of the residents are very concerned.", "I know that I’ve met with members of the Glen Agar Residents Association. That’s a group of residents who have come together because they’re concerned about a development that is in the initial planning stages in that community.", "These are three parts of my community that represent thousands and tens of thousands of people, and residents’ associations have advocated on behalf of those communities because they’re concerned about the impact on the community of these developments.", "If there’s one thing that I’ve learned from going through this process and working with the various organizations and communities that I’ve talked about, it is that the communities have a very important role to play, or should have an important role to play, in how their communities get developed. When applications get filed for development, particularly in an established community, those communities, those residents, those community associations who speak for the residents and advocate for the residents, can play a part in that planning process and can play a part to be able to respond to what’s been proposed.", "I know there are a number of components to this bill, but the one that I’m particularly interested in and want to speak to today is the role that communities will be able to play in the development process and this element that I think the ministry refers to as “enhancing citizen engagement”; for example, requiring that municipalities and approval authorities explain how public input affected their planning decision. It’s one thing to have a meeting, to listen and then make a decision; it’s another thing to link that input with the decision and help residents understand that. That’s really requiring, in my mind, accountability to the residents. I think that’s a really good thing and an important thing.", "Require that municipal official plans include locally designed public consultation policies: It’s not enough to say we consulted. You have to have a policy and an approach. Again, this requires accountability to the residents to be able to say, “Here’s how we’re going to consult with you.” I think that’s important.", "Increasing the use of planning advisory committees and ensuring citizen membership on these committees: I think that’s another important mechanism through which communities can have input into the planning process.", "I started my remarks by talking about how developments can impact a community. I gave three examples in my community of Etobicoke Centre. Like I said, if there’s one thing I learned, it’s that communities must have a voice and a meaningful role in making sure that these developments are handled responsibly and that the communities can maintain the quality of life that they’ve become accustomed to.", "These changes are particularly interesting, and I think as we look forward to the consultations around the OMB and some of the reforms that may potentially be proposed there, it’s really exciting for a community like Etobicoke Centre." ],

AMO has yet to really make a decision on how they feel about this bill.", "So where was the consultation?

In particular, it would change the parkland dedication rate for cash in lieu and try to incent the actual acquisition of parkland, and it would require more municipalities to prepare park plans in consultation with school boards and the public to facilitate planning for parkland green space and park facilities.", "So let me put that in English, because it’s not at all clear what that means. In my municipality, in Guelph, in my hometown, the two school boards and the municipality actually do quite a good job of working together on planning issues, because the municipality, when a new subdivision is being planned, actually has the authority to ask for some of the land to be dedicated to parkland. The two boards and the municipality will often work together to have some land dedicated for parkland and then the two neighbourhood school sites co-located with the parkland, which means that in the long haul everybody can use the parkland. There’s a good parkland plan for that.", "But that doesn’t happen in every municipality. In lots of municipalities, the municipality just takes some cash from the developer. They don’t create parkland, and there’s a bit of a mess in the long haul when all of a sudden you’ve got development after development after development and no parkland.

When you’re dealing with small subdivisions, and we’re talking 10, 15 lots, it doesn’t make sense—you know, parks in a rural area are done generally by area. We don’t have the benefit of the large subdivisions.", "So sometimes it may have to be looked at, because I know there are some terms around trying to quantify what the cash transfer should be or whether it’s a finished lot or unserviced land that should be transferred over. But the basis is, we like to create regional parks that would fit all the small, little subdivisions in one area, because that’s the only thing that makes sense in rural Ontario.", "I think it’s a good point. It has to be addressed and clarified because, I know from our side, there’s a lot of confusion. Developers aren’t happy, municipalities aren’t happy, and in the end, it wastes a lot of time. But for the most part, I always saw the OMB as a necessity, something that is in a way a kind of sober second thought. It made sure that councils were following the regulations. It takes some of the political side out of it. Especially maybe in some of the smaller councils, it can be a little bit of, “Well, it’s Joe down the street. But Harry up the road is a little bit different,” and that’s not right.", "So I think we want to make sure that that opportunity is there.

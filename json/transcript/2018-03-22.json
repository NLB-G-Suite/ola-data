  "text" : [ "Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to rise today and discuss the throne speech.", "With my time, I’d like to go over some of the things that were in the speech, but first I would like to begin with things that are not in the speech and how they affect my communities. We know that this budget is going to have to have a lot of spending in it, but I still worry that the priorities aren’t there. This government has had 15 years to figure out what their priorities are, so I want to go down the list of issues in my communities and raise them in response to the throne speech and before the budget is released.", "Let me start with Fort Erie, Madam Speaker. You changed very quickly; there you go.", "Working together, we have accomplished some incredible things in Fort Erie. We’ve managed to build a state-of-the-art educational institution for our children. There is still work to be done there to ensure that there are no capacity issues as the town grows and that kids have access to the very best as it becomes available to them. But we’ve made progress. Now we have the opportunity to use those old schools as community hubs and bring a number of community groups under one roof and expand those services.", "This is an incredible opportunity and one I am proud to work with the community in supporting. This is a way we can ensure that the services offered in Crystal Beach, Ridgeway, Stevensville and Fort Erie itself can be expanded and made accessible to everyone in the town while using a property that is currently empty.", "On the issue of the Fort Erie Race Track—and I know I’ve talked about this constantly for the last four years but it’s an issue I’m passionate about—we’ve made a lot of progress. Working together with the town and the residents, we saved the track from closure, and we have been able to reverse Woodbine’s damaging stalling policy, which threatened our track. But let me say this clearly: We need gaming back. There are 300 jobs if we do that—300 jobs if we do that. I want it to be slots. If I could put them in there myself, I would, but we need this government to commit to returning gaming to Fort Erie. This budget could provide for the people of Fort Erie and it could create good-paying jobs.", "Madam Speaker, I’m going to talk about something else that’s incredibly important to me: long-term care. Seniors—our parents, our grandparents—built our communities. They built our communities with their bare hands and raised their families, yet when they need to rely on this government for long-term care or home care, they are being let down. Waiting lists for long-term care have exploded. There are over 30,000 residents on waiting lists right now. In some cases they’re waiting over a year. The Premier should be ashamed of that record.", "Seniors deserve better, and their issues must be championed. We need a new direction that actually respects seniors and puts them first. Forget these wasteful privatization schemes that this government is focused on. Solving the long-term-care crisis in Niagara needs to be put at the top of their priority list. The PCs have absolutely no right to comment on this. The last time they were in charge, they froze hospital budgets, cut home care, closed 28 hospitals and fired 6,000 nurses.", "We also need to talk about health care more generally in the province of Ontario. Right now across this province we have people waiting in hallways to get the medical care they need. Let me say this clearly: Not one person in our province should have to wait for hours in a hallway to see a doctor or to get the care they need. Health care is a right, and so is getting the health care you need when you need it.", "We can solve this problem in Niagara. If we move up the build of the new hospital, we can eliminate hallway medicine in Niagara Falls. Not only can we provide a higher standard of care for residents, but we can create good-paying jobs for local workers. If we move up the build, we can provide residents with a decent standard of health care, and working families with a decent income. There is absolutely no reason why the ministry should not focus its attention on making this happen.", "Madam Speaker, another health care issue is mental health supports. I can’t stress how urgent the need to deal with the lack of mental health supports is. We have thousands of children on wait-lists trying to see a doctor who need our help. They can’t wait for the support they need. They need it now. People are struggling, and they feel like they’re struggling alone. We need to reach out and tell them that they’re not alone, that we’re here for them and we’re taking this very seriously. That means investing in these supports immediately. If there’s one thing we can justify spending government funds on, it has to be providing mental health support to residents. We can do this in coordinated fashion and put these all under one ministry with a mandate to fix the crisis.", "When people are struggling with mental health issues, they begin to struggle at work or find it even harder to find a job in the first place. It isn’t hard to see how this impacts our province, so it makes good economic sense to provide this service as well. I know the PCs don’t support this action—because they were the ones who closed mental health facilities down in the first place—but this is too important to ignore.", "In addition to moving up the build of the new hospital, we must also move up the GO train deadline. Again, the quicker we make these projects happen, the sooner we can put people to work. If you understand what I’m trying to say here—whether it’s in Fort Erie, Niagara Falls or all of Niagara, what are we talking about? Putting people to work with good-paying jobs they can support their families on.", "We’ve been meeting with Metrolinx executives and the executives from Niagara Health on both of these issues to try to move up the dates, because it’s clear to the people in Niagara Falls that they need these services sooner rather than later.", "On the GO train file, we should be extremely proud. All of the actors across a number of levels were able to come together and make this project happen—everyone except the PCs, who were opposed to the project. Regardless of that, we were able to show what we can accomplish when we all work together. I invite those members to work with us on this project and to move these deadlines up. Our cities are growing; we need those services now to keep up.", "Madam Speaker, as you can tell, I’m going through my riding, if anybody was wondering.", "Let’s talk about Niagara-on-the-Lake. In Niagara-on-the-Lake we have the best wineries, the best craft brewers, and some of the best food and hospitality you can find anywhere in the world. Now is the time to invest in these businesses and remove the barriers they face. They’re growing at an incredible rate and, more importantly, they’re providing jobs for our residents." ],

Niagara-on-the-Lake’s arts and culture industry is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Places like the Shaw have created an industry that not only draws in tens of thousands of visitors to support our local industries but provides careers for young people in the arts. It provides a soul for our province. I know that many politicians overlook how important the arts and culture industry is in communities, but that’s a mistake. I’ll say that again: That’s a mistake.", "If they want an example of how well that industry supports towns and cities, and why they need government investment, I invite them to come to Niagara-on-the-Lake and tour the wonderful town with me. I guarantee you, it will make my point.", "We also need to talk about developments and what role this province will play in ensuring that developments are sustainable.", "Niagara-on-the-Lake is truly a jewel of Canada. The residents have worked very hard to preserve the incredible history of the town, which, quite frankly, is the history of this great nation and province. People live there because they love their community. Right now, there’s a controversial development project in the town which revolves around a resort that will include a six-storey building—I’ll repeat that: It will include a six-storey building. The most important thing to me about this project is to listen to the residents first. They’re the ones who have built and maintained that town and made it what it is today. They deserve the credit for making the town what it is and their voices must be heard. They don’t want to lose the character that makes that town so special, and frankly, I stand with them.", "Madam Speaker, this government does have a role to play in this. I know there’s going to be changes to the OMB so it’s clear they’re willing to work on this. They have to make sure that that process takes into account what the residents want, what the community wants, what the town wants and, quite frankly, what elected officials want.", "I’d also like to talk about the Niagara-on-the-Lake historical society and museum. A little while ago I was contacted by the society asking me to support their request for increased funding through the Community Museum Operating Grant. When this request came to my office, I didn’t even think twice about supporting this. The work they do there is incredible. They preserve the history of the town but also the history of this country which flows through the town. They work hard to build a sense of community in Niagara-on-the-Lake and to ensure that their doors are open to the residents.", "Of course, like in every community, I have to mention the volunteers. The time and effort that their volunteers put in to make the historical society and museum operate the way it does is nothing short of inspiring. I know a lot of you have heard me bragging about those residents, but I’ll say it again: As the MPP who represents them, I’m truly blessed to have such selfless people working in our community. For those reasons, I want to say in this House that the work they do deserves support, and I’m proud to join in their request to continue to increase this funding. I have seen first-hand the good work that they do in the community. I believe this is exactly what the provincial funding should be used for.", "I’d like to talk about another issue that stretches across all communities: hydro rates. I know the Premier doesn’t like to talk about it anymore, but hydro rates are a crisis in Niagara. People and businesses are struggling to cover the costs that have come because of the privatization of Hydro One. It was wrong then, and the rates today show that.", "We need a new plan that gives people hope and that actually lowers their rates. Seniors shouldn’t have to choose between hydro bills and medication. Young people shouldn’t have to choose between owning a home and hydro bills. Employers shouldn’t have to worry about hydro bills or hiring someone.", "In Niagara, we’re directly beside the Falls, yet we watch the province sell our power at a loss to the United States. It’s absolutely unacceptable that this is still happening today. People have been fighting against this for four years. The Premier needs to act. It’s time to put an end to the wasteful privatization scheme and actually produce a plan which lowers hydro bills. That means bringing hydro back into public plans and lowering their bills by 40%. That makes more sense than padding the pockets of private investors or the rich and famous.", "We’ve seen it with gas prices, too. We offered a solution, and it was voted down by the Liberal Party. It’s clearly not a priority for them.", "The prices of a barrel of oil are still lower than they were a few years ago, yet our prices keep going up. I was in my riding again yesterday. It’s $1.27. We never see those savings at the pump; instead, what we see are constantly increasing gasoline prices and excuses that aren’t worth the paper they are written on.", "My residents, your residents and residents all over the province of Ontario are not dumb. They can see what’s happening here. They know they are being gouged, and they know the government is doing nothing to stop it. I’m going to repeat that line, because it’s important: They know they are being gouged, and they know the government is doing nothing to stop it.", "Just last week in Niagara Falls, the gas prices jumped by 10 cents for no reason at all, overnight." ],

That’s happening right here in Ontario. It’s happening in your community that’s heckling you. Your residents don’t like it, just like my residents don’t like it.

It’s nothing more than gouging, and the people need a break. It’s all about affordability; whether it’s hydro bills or whether it’s the gas prices, that’s what it’s about. That’s our job here: Making sure it’s affordable to live in the province of Ontario.", "On this throne speech, all I can say is this: It seems there’s far too little here and that it’s far too late. The Liberals are now saying that they care about child care and about prescription medicine. They now say they care about hallway medicine and long-term-care wait-lists. They’ve had 15 years to fix these problems. How can they expect us to believe they want to fix them now? How can anybody believe them?", "Madam Speaker, I believe we need pharmacare in this province—for everyone. I believe we need dental care in this province—for everyone. We can do this. We don’t need the $6.1 billion worth of cuts that Doug Ford is promising. Families don’t need more cuts in their lives. Instead, they need things that will give them hope. They need change, but they need change for the better, change that will help them get ahead and have better services.", "Madam Speaker, the throne speech didn’t mention homeowners at all. One of the things we’ve been working so hard on is Tarion reform. Ultimately, we ended up voting against that bill because it simply didn’t protect homeowners. That’s the key to the bill: It didn’t protect homeowners. Homeowners need us; they need us now. Getting rid of Tarion but replacing it with another system that still gives too much power to home builders and not enough power to homeowners is no better. What about the people who have been battling with Tarion for years already? This government had a chance to make this right and they failed that test, so it’s time for a real change on that front.", "I can say I’m happy to see our NDP finance critic was able to pass a motion directing the Auditor General to investigate Tarion. I suppose I could sum up my feelings on this by simply saying that it’s about time. There is so much more that needs to be done for the homeowners, but this is an important step which will prove many of the things activists and homeowners have been saying for years.", "Madam Speaker, there are so many issues here that it’s hard to see where to begin. Obviously, this throne speech can’t contain everything, but it’s clear to me that they missed some very big priorities. I look forward to seeing the budget and going through it in detail. I hope it addresses some of these glaring holes.", "We need change in the province of Ontario. We need change for the better." ],

It’s about the intentionality of our choices, and it’s very clear what we’re going to do. If you take a look at the announcement yesterday on mental health and the $2.1 billion over the next four years for more access to community-based therapy, mental health workers for high schools, more youth wellness hubs, more supportive housing, and more access to residential withdrawal and treatment services for youth and adults suffering from addictions, I think that’s very clear about what our intentions are and what we’re going to do to achieve that.", "I would like to remind the member about choices. He talked about mental health beds, and I just want to remind him: When your party was in power, you made choices too. You closed 13% of the mental health beds. That’s not to wag a finger. I’m just saying that we all have to make choices. We all know that in this House.", "He wanted to talk about change. Actually, things that change people’s lives are eliminating coal so there are lower rates of childhood asthma, and full-day kindergarten so the kids get a better start in life and families can get out there and participate in the economy earlier. It’s like OHIP+, making sure that every child and youth under 25 has access to free prescription medications. It’s like fighting for that stronger Canada Pension Plan so that everybody has some more retirement security. Those are the things that change people’s lives. That’s change, and that’s what we have been doing for 15 years." ],

I think all of us use the opportunity of responding to a throne speech to talk about our riding, and it’s perfectly appropriate for him to do so. But when he talks about the activity and points fingers at other parties about mental health, I think that we have to put a few facts on the record.", "I understand the member has been here since 2014, but perhaps he could go and speak to his member from Nickel Belt and talk about the 18 months that, collectively, all of us from the three political parties spent on mental health and addictions. It came out as a result of a 2008 resolution from a—wait for it—Progressive Conservative member. Then the committee was ultimately struck, and 18 months later we came forward with a report. So please—please—don’t tell me that only one political party has a lock or can be able to speak on specific issues, because it’s wrong and it’s not conducive to the type of co-operative legislative activities that we can do here when we actually work together and come forward collectively with positive ideas.", "I’m pleased that he was talking about mental health and the need for further investments, but to suggest that one political party did nothing while everybody else was talking about it is clearly wrong. All you have to do is look at the 2008 resolution and the 2010 all-party support that came out as a result of that." ],

He went through the different responsibilities of the provincial government and what that looks like on the ground.", "He gives the example of the Niagara Health System, the hospital that is in his riding that has been overcrowded—just like every other large community hospital throughout Ontario—where people are admitted to the hospital but there is no bed for them; where all of a sudden, what used to be a bathroom or a shower room is becoming a bed for people to be admitted to; where what used to be a TV room or a lounge is now a place for four, sometimes five people to be admitted.", "Those are rooms that don’t have a sink. Those are rooms that don’t have a bathroom. Those are rooms where the indignity of people goes on and on, where you have to use a commode, where everybody in the room knows that you are using the commode. It is degrading. It is not what people expect from our hospitals, but this is where we are at in Ontario. He gives good examples of what that means for the people he represents.", "He also talks about the need for pharmacare. Ontario has six drug plans right now, the latest one being OHIP+. But pharmacare means universal. It means no matter who you are, your age or your condition, you will have drug coverage. This is something that people need, people want. We now have a speech from the throne that promises to undo all of the damage they have done for 15 years. They have had 15 years to do that." ],

The four-year investment of $2.1 billion is actually going to rebuild the system.", "I would also like to reiterate the comments made by the member for Dufferin–Caledon, that we really do need to co-operatively and collectively work together.

There’s no argument there. Six thousand nurses lost their jobs; there’s no argument there.", "But when you talk about mental health, not only did they close 28 hospitals, they also closed all of the mental health hospitals. All of the mental health hospitals were closed under their leadership. What bothered me the most around that is that they didn’t take the money they got from closing them and reinvest it back into mental health services. That was a mistake.

Thank you for being here.", "I’m very excited to speak about this speech from the throne because it’s a speech that speaks to the values that we all share as members of our society and our community. The value is one and simple, and that is to look after each other and to care for each other in our lives every single day. As human beings—fathers and mothers, grandparents, uncles and aunts, friends and neighbours—we are determined to look after each other and we are persuaded to look after each other and to care for each other.", "As a father of two young children, the number one big lesson that I continue to teach my children is to look after each other, to care for each other, because that’s the most important value we have. This speech from the throne really captures that. I think it’s exciting to talk about that, because sometimes governments are seen as large institutions removed from our daily lives. People forget that government has a very important role: to make our lives easier and to make our lives better.", "This particular speech from the throne, and my reason for supporting the speech, is exactly that, because it really focuses on things that matter to us, and that is to care for each other. The speech really encapsulates our desire to build a caring and fair society, a society that gives everybody an opportunity to grow, because that’s how we will build Ontario up.", "When I’m in my community of Ottawa Centre, the conversations I’m having with people at the doors as I am out canvassing every weekend—as I do and as I have been doing over the last 10 years since I’ve been an elected member of provincial Parliament—are around the kind of initiatives the government is working on that are making life easier for everyone.

The financial part is taken care of. If we are going to truly put an end to the cycle of poverty, we know education is the most powerful tool to accomplish that. By making free tuition available for students coming from low-income families to mid-income families is a tremendous move.", "Not to mention the increase in minimum wage, to $14 an hour starting last January and then to $15 an hour on January 1, 2019: Truly, making sure we have a living wage in our province is really creating an opportunity for people who rely on minimum wage to live a better life so that they are not depending on food banks and so that they are actually able to use that money to buy clothes for their families and to get good, healthy food for their children—the kinds of things we should all care about.", "That is what a care agenda looks like, where we are focusing on things that help people in their day-to-day lives. That is what our government is doing.", "I would be remiss if I did not speak about the kinds of important investments we are making in my community of Ottawa Centre to make sure that people have the most important public services available to them, because those are key—things like education, health care and infrastructure.", "In terms of health care, we are really fortunate in Ottawa Centre to have three really robust community health centres that provide just remarkable health and social services at a community level in the downtown core of Ottawa. All of those three community health centres are growing, thanks to the investments that our government is making.", "For example, we just recently started a major expansion project at Centretown Community Health Centre—over $5.4 million—so that they can serve more people from our community on things like mental health and addiction services, diabetes, child care: very important services to have a healthy downtown community.", "Similarly, the Somerset West Community Health Centre was just recently approved as a supervised safe injection site by the federal government. Our government is providing them the operational funding and the capital funding so that a supervised injection site could open as quickly as possible. Again, that just goes to saving lives, making sure that those in our community who are suffering from the disease of addiction, are victims of this opioid crisis, have the kinds of the supports they need right in the community.", "I’m also very excited about the Carlington Community Health Centre, which is building a very unique housing and health hub. They’re building 42 affordable housing units for seniors, but they will have access to state-of-the-art community health care right onsite. That’s a project almost close to $5 million. That is taking place between my riding and Ottawa West–Nepean, represented by Mr. Chiarelli.", "Similarly, on the health care front, the Ottawa heart institute, which is a remarkable institution, is seeing a $200-million expansion. Actually, the opening is tomorrow, so I can’t wait to tell you how excited we are to have that world-class health care.", "Education is another fundamental value, as I spoke to earlier. When I see the schools in my community, like the new Broadview school, a $15-million investment, up and running—and Elmdale Public School, located in Wellington Village, will be seeing an investment of $3.6 million so that we can build an addition and then upgrade this historic school into a modern place for our students to learn.", "I’m really excited to note that, for the first time, we have our first French public school, École élémentaire publique Centre-Nord, in my community.

Phase 1 is almost done—an investment of $600 million by our government. But we’re not just stopping there. We, in fact, have already committed an over $1-billion investment in phase 2 of the LRT. That will really connect the rest of the city to the downtown core, including our airport, so that Ottawa, as a capital city, is really, genuinely a G7 city. We’re really, really excited about that.", "Not to mention the investments we’re making in affordable housing, such as projects by Cornerstone Housing for Women and the John Howard Society, where we really focused on putting an end to chronic homelessness, in parallel with the provincial Ontario housing strategy. These projects, which are happening in the downtown core—in the community of Ottawa Centre, the riding that I have the honour of serving—are really starting to make an impact in making sure that people have access to good housing with appropriate supports around mental health and addiction and other health care services.", "Speaker, I can go on and on, but I just wanted to give you a highlight of what, really—on the ground, on the front line, in the community—a care agenda looks like, an agenda that is championed by our Premier and this government.

The fact is, Madam Speaker, that Ontario is a great place to live. Ontario is, without a question in my mind, one of the most beautiful places and one of the best places anyone can live in on this entire planet. That’s why we get so many people from around the world coming to Ontario each year; we get so many people from across the country coming to Ontario every single year.", "They talk about the economy being so bad in Ontario. You hear these little pieces of information they put forward—especially the Conservatives. They talk about the economy doing poorly. I think it was back in 2012 that there were more buildings being built in the GTA than all of North America combined. The former Premier used to say that. Our economy is the strongest now of the G7 countries. We have the lowest unemployment in almost 20 years.", "There are a lot of great things that are happening in Ontario. We’ve gone through a transition. Our economy has changed. We’ve gone from more of an analog- to a digital-style economy, so things are going well. When I hear the opposition talk about how sad it is in Ontario and things are so gloomy—you know what? Get out there and talk to people. Knock on some doors, walk down the street, talk to people about how they feel being in Ontario and you get a completely different picture than this image you get that is coming from the opposition.", "We want to put in services and we want to make sure that people have the services they need when they need them. I remember growing up in Flemingdon Park and in Don Mills. My mother was a superintendent of a building. She used to clean the building that we lived in. I can remember when my parents separated—I was about 15 or 16 years old—my mother had to go and change her job because it just didn’t pay enough. She actually got a job at—it was called Bloorview MacMillan at the time, and she served food there. That’s what she did for a living to put food on the table in our house. I remember that the management company said that she had to leave the building because she was no longer the superintendent. I remember my mother going to the Flemingdon Park legal clinic to get help because we were being thrown out of the building. I can remember her getting that help and someone there working with her, and we finally got to stay in the building.", "I always think of that story, and I think of my brother, who went back to school and he was working in a restaurant. It was a low-paying job. He decided to go back to upgrade his skill sets and so he took the Second Career course. This was maybe in 2007-08. It was another government program that was offered by our province. My brother is now a welder in the Kitchener–Waterloo area; he is a welder out there for Caterpillar.", "For me, those are the types of things that we need to have in place, so when people go through some challenges they have the help out there.", "But there is a myth out there.

I went through some of the numbers and went through some of the data, and I showed him numbers that came out from some think tanks that are not necessarily very supportive of Liberals. But they concluded as well that the economy has been managed well over the last decade when we went through—almost a decade ago, it was the start of one of the worst economic recessions in the history of this country. During that time period, the Harper government, who were Conservatives in power—the former leader of their party was part of that regime—they ran the largest deficit in the history of Canada.", "In addition to that, if you think about Ontario, and I don’t know if many Conservatives know this, but the budget has been balanced in this province in the last 45 years, I think, nine times. Five of those times have been managed by Liberals; it’s been balanced by Liberals.", "Going back to Harper, by the time he came in up until 2015, he ran a deficit, collectively, of about $150 billion, so all the gains that Chrétien and Martin made over those years were just completely wiped out.", "There’s a myth out there in Ontario that the Conservatives are these great managers of the economy. This is what the Conservatives do when they come into power. This is the game plan. It doesn’t matter if you are in Ontario, if you are across this country or even in the United States; this is what the Conservatives do: They come in and they say, “Enough is enough. We’re going to make some cuts because we need to save money.”", "But here’s what happens: They make those cuts—for example, I was part of the literacy sector, and the Conservatives, these guys, cut $27 million from literacy and basic skills. You know when you talk about helping a person? That’s the basic form of helping a person: having them have the ability to read. They cut that funding to adult literacy.", "The Conservatives opposite, when they were in power—and this is, I think, the best example anyone can give about the type of approach the Conservatives take here in Ontario, which is so opposite from what we have offered in our throne speech. Developmental disabilities in Ontario was cut by 7%. Think about that for a second. These are our most vulnerable people in our society, the developmentally delayed. Developmental services: That line was cut by 7%. So when the Conservatives stand up and they say, “You know, you’re not doing enough for these folks and you’re not doing enough for these folks,” when you go down to the very basics, literacy and basic skills, and when you talk about things like developmental delay and developmental services, imagine a government making those cuts to those types of services.", "I think it just says exactly who we’re dealing with. We’re dealing with a group of people who stand up and say they believe in making Ontario great and supporting people. But the best thing you can do if you want to really figure out the true intentions of a group of people who want to manage the government or the economy of a province is just to look at their track record. If you look at our track record over the last 15 years—the NDP is saying, “Over the last 15 years nothing has been done.” We have the strongest economy, number one. Number two: We went from an education system where one third of our students were not graduating—we have gone from 66% graduation to 86.5% today, I think it is. We have transformed public education. We have transformed health care from the longest to the some of the shortest wait times in the country. Now with our mental health investments—remember, the Conservatives wanted to invest $1.9 billion over 10 years. We’re investing $2.1 billion over four years." ],

You can go into any community throughout our province and you will see private clinics that were never there before.

  "text" : [ "Before I get into the bill, I’m going to just provide a little historical context to the Taxpayer Protection Act. It was introduced in this House in 1999 and passed by the Progressive Conservative government of the day in 1999. The Taxpayer Protection Act took new avenues to protect taxpayers from governments’ coming out with new forms of taxation at the time in an unaccountable way or not a transparent way to the people of Ontario.", "The bill, in 1999, stated that this House and the government of the day and the governments subsequent would be obligated to either tell people through a general election if there were plans to increase taxes or to create new taxes, or, in mid-term, if they wanted to increase taxes, they would have to go to a referendum of the people and put it before the people before a new tax was adopted—a strong, strong measure to protect taxpayers from the abuses of government. Make government state during a general election if they plan on introducing new taxes or go to a referendum.", "We held true to that for a number of years, until 2003, when the Liberal government took over in Ontario. They immediately found a loophole in that Taxpayer Protection Act of 1999. They found that they could exempt themselves from the law using either an exemption or a “notwithstanding” in new legislation.", "So in 2003, we saw immediately the Liberal government of the day bring in a new health care tax—they tried to use the term “premium.” They brought it in without telling people during the general election, so that was a violation of the Taxpayer Protection Act. They did it without bringing forward a referendum. That would have been a violation of the Taxpayer Protection Act. Then they tried to use the term “premium” instead of “tax,” but it was still determined to be a tax. So they’ve used this mechanism to say, “Notwithstanding the Taxpayer Protection Act, we’re going to bring in a new tax.” It really makes the Taxpayer Protection Act redundant.", "So I’ve introduced this bill, an amendment to the Taxpayer Protection Act which would prevent the government from bringing in a bill to exempt themselves from the functions of the Taxpayer Protection Act unless, of course, they did the same thing: Go to a referendum or state their case to the people of this province in a general election. That is what representative and accountable governments must do. They must inform the electorate of what their intentions are during the campaign, and if they want to alter significantly from that course during their mandate, they should once again go back to the people.", "Taxation is a critical, critical function of government and a critical function of society. I’m just going to read a little bit from the throne speech so that we know. On page 4 of the throne speech there are a number of facts, and we can attribute most of those facts to excessive taxation. Here’s what the throne speech said:", "“For many of our friends and neighbours, life is getting harder.", "“Our world is changing in ways we’ve never seen before and at speeds that make it feel hard to keep up.", "“The cost of living is rising, and at the same time, stable, long-term jobs—jobs that pay a decent wage—are proving harder to find.", "“Part-time and precarious work is becoming more common ...", "“And as these pressures mount, they bear down on families where it matters most.", "“People are struggling to take care of themselves, and their loved ones.”", "That’s a quote directly from this throne speech that was introduced on Monday.", "I can tell you those are facts. We all recognize them. But let’s take a look at what has caused it.", "In Ontario today, people pay twice as much in taxes every year as they do for their homes. Twice as much is paid in taxes as for shelter. If we want to make life more affordable, easier and less burdensome, why don’t we do something about that significant cost?", "This government talks about affordable housing; how about we begin to talk about affordable taxation? The average family pays more in this province in taxes than they do for all the necessities of life—more than shelter, more than food. All the necessities combined take up the average family’s income at 37%, but taxes are at 42.5%. How can that be, that the necessities of life are less costly than the taxation in life? This is a bizarre, bizarre situation, Speaker.", "Let me just provide a few examples of how this government has manipulated and how they have circumvented the Taxpayer Protection Act over the years. They, of course, created a new high-income tax bracket. That tax change in 2012 and expanded once again in 2014 raised the top provincial tax rate before surtaxes up to over 13%. They used that exemption process. They purposely circumvented the Taxpayer Protection Act. They didn’t mention it in the general election, and they circumvented the act.", "Since 2011, the tax on microbrewed beer has more than doubled. Did we ever hear that in an election mandate from this government? Absolutely not. Did it ever go to a referendum? Absolutely not.", "The same with taxes on boutique wines: They have been going up year after year after year. They have used that exemption process, that notwithstanding process, to once again circumvent.", "Tobacco taxes have gone up seven times since this government has come into power. That may be fine, but governments must be accountable. They must state their case during a general election. If they want to raise taxes, tell the people so. Let them be judged factually, on a truthful platform, and come clean to the people of Ontario.", "In 2015, the Ontario budget introduced a new three-cent-a-litre tax on beer. That was not mentioned in the 2014 election. How can it be that this government, during the election platforms, never mentioned what they’re actually going to do?", "Before I go on more and more about this, Speaker, I think it’s also interesting to recognize that there’s a correlation: Taxes have been going up each and every year since this Liberal government came into power, but just as importantly, our debt and our deficits have also been going up. Somebody might say, “How can that be? We keep raising taxes, but our debt keeps going up at an even greater rate.” That’s a fact; we’re now well over $300 billion in debt. What is it? It’s $312 billion in debt. Just six years ago, our debt stood at $236 billion. Our taxes keep going up by an ever-increasing rate, and our debt goes up by an ever-increasing rate. Most people would say that’s an impossibility, to achieve that, but that’s what this Liberal government has achieved.", "I think we need to recognize that as taxation increases with the Liberal government, debt increases. The only way to counter this—it may sound counterintuitive to the Liberal government—the way to lower our debt is actually to lower our taxation. It’s not an incomprehensible understanding for most people, but it clearly is for this government. Those are the facts: Taxation keeps going up; debt keeps going up.", "I’ve introduced this bill to prevent those devious procedural ways of using exemptions and notwithstanding clauses to circumvent their obligation to the people. We’ll see if it gets passed in this House today. I hope it does. I’m looking forward to the debate on this bill, about why people believe that government ought not to state their case to the people before they raise taxes—I’m going to be listening for that—or why they ought not to go to a referendum before they make life harder on the people of Ontario and make people struggle more with an ever-increasing taxation burden and an ever-increasing debt burden on them.", "Speaker, in the 2015 budget, they did it again: They used that exemption of the Taxpayer Protection Act to bring in the Provincial Land Tax and to increase that. The examples are significant, Speaker. Let’s put people first in this province. Let’s actually help them out. Forget this caring and fluff and stuff in the throne speech, and let’s actually help them." ],

Mr. Hudak said that was necessary because the Liberals, under former Premier Dalton McGuinty, had pledged to not raise taxes and then brought in the health tax, the harmonized sales tax and the eco-tax, despite his promises to the contrary. Of course, the Liberals responded by saying that this was the same Tim Hudak who voted twice to override the Taxpayer Protection Act and raise corporate taxes. Is it any wonder, Speaker, why politicians are held in such low regard by Canadians?", "There was a poll a couple of years ago carried in the Huffington Post. Ipsos Reid was hired to do a trustworthy poll, and more than 4,000 people were surveyed. Firefighters came out on top, with an approval rating of 77%. Paramedics were close at 74%. Way down the list—way, way down the list—telemarketers hit rock bottom at 4%, car salespeople at 5%, and politicians and bloggers were at 6%.

That was after downloading services onto the municipal tax base, which saved the PCs $2 billion or $3 billion but shifted that tax burden onto the backs of the municipal tax base. I don’t know the real deficit. It certainly wasn’t a balanced budget, as they claimed.", "Speaker, Winston Churchill was always good for a quote.

There’s never any convenient time for any of them.”", "On the other hand, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. has said, “I like to pay taxes. With them, I buy civilization.”", "At the heart of this bill is that politicians should keep their word—no broken promises. If you don’t campaign on raising taxes, you can’t do it when you’re in office. That’s like saying that you wouldn’t sell Hydro One while going door to door during an election before you’re elected, and then listening to someone who told you, “Yes, but you know what? We can make a lot of money for our friends on Bay Street if we sell a majority of the shares.” Well, guess who does that sort of thing?", "The poet Robert Service said that “a promise made is a debt unpaid.”", "Football legend Lou Holtz said, “Don’t ever promise more than you can deliver, but always deliver more than you promise.”", "How about William Lyon Mackenzie?

I’m delighted to be able to participate in this discussion.", "I’m particularly delighted that I could follow the member for Windsor–Tecumseh. He’s so erudite. It’s an incredibly good, well-researched background. I wonder how many people picked up on the Cremation of Sam McGee reference about “a promise made is a debt unpaid.” I was reading it on the weekend with some friends of ours, and it was interesting to hear him bring it up today.", "To speak on Bill 15, the Taxpayer Protection Amendment Act: The member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington is, of course, reintroducing a bill that he brought in once before. It was soundly defeated in this House, for very good reasons. I suspect that it will happen once again today.", "First off, let’s just take a look at the focus of where the member takes it—just the name of the bill itself, the Taxpayer Protection Amendment Act. It’s so typical of the members of the official opposition to think that taxpayers are the only people who matter in the province of Ontario. There are a lot more people who we serve in Ontario than strictly the taxpayers. That includes the people who don’t pay taxes, people who are new Canadians, people who are on OW and people who are on ODSP, who aren’t making enough income to pay taxes. We have a responsibility to look after those who are less fortunate in our society. I know that’s the Liberal way, and it’s what makes me very proud to be a Liberal in this House, that we do look after those who are less fortunate than ourselves. To create a bill that is focused strictly on taxpayer rights, I think, is in itself mean-spirited, and I couldn’t support it.", "I also found it very interesting that the member talked at length about the taxes that he was most concerned about: tobacco taxes, liquor taxes, beer taxes, craft beer taxes. As you know, I have been a pioneer in the craft beer industry for years, going back some 40 years, when I initially raised the changes which allowed for craft beers in this province to come forward. What we saw recently and what our government was able to do on the alcohol file was actually to reduce taxes on craft ciders and craft beers.", "I’m very proud of the role that I could take to encourage our government to encourage those sectors, as we have encouraged the craft beer sector. It has been extraordinarily successful. Everyone making craft beer in the province of Ontario, I believe, is making money. They’re just popping up everywhere. There’s going to be a craft beer in every single municipality in the province of Ontario soon, and I hope that is followed by people making craft ciders and craft spirits.", "I had the pleasure at the Oscar awards—I was down at the Palais Royale as my friends got the Oscar for best picture for The Shape of Water. I enjoyed the wonderful spirits of Beattie’s. It’s a farm up in Alliston. I went and chatted with the owners of Beattie’s, and they said, “My God, this is the most incredible tax reduction that we’ve ever seen in Ontario.” It allows them as a small business to create jobs.", "I look at this particular bill, and as I read it through, I wonder: Are you going to need to bring a referendum or make a promise during the election that you’re going to reduce taxes in order to follow through on that pledge? I think that would be ludicrous. It’s the same thing: Would you have to pass a special bill in order to reduce taxes in the province of Ontario? We’re taking those directions.", "The member talked about how taxes are rising. Well, we haven’t raised income tax in this province outside of the very first year here. We raised a little tax on the top 1% of earners, but for the most part, we have done everything we’ve done building the province of Ontario up by holding the line on taxes and investing in communities and investing in infrastructure, and it has been extraordinarily successful.", "I’d also like to point out that there is an accountability for raising taxes. It’s called an election. We’re coming into one very shortly. If the member thinks that people are going to be judging our party as a party that raised taxes to the point that they want to vote us out of office, I think he’s sorely mistaken, because it just hasn’t happened. It would be hard for him to go door to door and say we have raised taxes.", "Now, we have increased debt; I will concede that point to him. But, Speaker, when you invest the kinds of monies that we’re investing in infrastructure to build this province up, you do increase your debt load, but it’s all offset by assets that are being built across this province: transit assets, hospital assets, school assets. So although there is some unsecured debt as a result of deficits, the bulk of what we see in the debt in this province is secured by hard assets that we can stand by, that make this province a better place.", "We know what happened in California when they brought in a rule that you couldn’t raise taxes without a referendum. They stopped investing in infrastructure, and it was a complete and utter disaster. I’m prepared to take the knock that if in the course of the four-year program, we feel it’s necessary to make a change in expenditures, we bring it in. We haven’t had to raise taxes in the last four years, but circumstances change. Four years can be a long time to go along, and so we wouldn’t do it.", "There was a great example of a Liberal in Hamilton, Sheila Copps, who did resign her seat because she had promised not to do something and then ended up being part of a party that did something. That’s a little different, because that is a broken promise. But there were things that we had to do. The member for Windsor–Tecumseh will remember that on page 22 of the preface of our budget last time, it talked about all the assets that we were considering selling off, but we did only settle on the one, Hydro One, and it has been a great deal for the taxpayers of Ontario. I’m prepared to stand up and defend that any time at all.", "Speaker, I’m delighted to speak on this bill today. I just don’t think it’s going to get my support." ],

I admire in most NDP governments their honesty, insofar as when an NDP government wants big government and wants to take over a lot of services and provide a lot of services—and that’s fine, that’s their philosophy; I understand that—they’re honest about upfront taxes. They increase taxes. We’ve seen a former member of this House, the current leader of the federal NDP, talk a lot about tax fairness. We can have philosophical disagreements about what that looks like. From my perspective, what he’s talking about is really just increasing taxes on everybody. But at least we know where the NDP is coming from. When they come in, they provide services and they increase taxes. That’s okay. That’s what they have always said they stand for. I think it’s fair to say that although no one says they like higher taxes—including what they would say—at least they’re honest about where they are coming from.", "The Liberals, on the other hand, like to talk a good game. I distinctly—actually, I don’t remember this because, quite frankly, I was too young to remember this. But I distinctly saw a very well-known pledge by a former Premier of Ontario, and it was a bit American in style, in the sense of, “Read my lips: no new taxes.” But instead of saying, “Read my lips: no new taxes,” he signed a pledge. After 15 years of Liberal government, the audacity of that government to stand and say that the investments they’ve been making are being serviced by taxes—" ],

Answer that question. It’s not a riddle. It’s a very simple formula. If you don’t want to raise taxes now, you’re going to sink the province into debt, you’re going to sink future generations into debt. You have to pay that off. And how are you paying that off? In the Liberals’ case, they don’t really have an answer. So they say they’re going to—what?—sign another pledge saying they’re not going to increase taxes? How did that go over in 2003?", "It’s disturbing the amount of times I sit here in this House and hear members of the government stand up—I’m not sure if they are just misled or if they sincerely believe their own talking points, their own spin on where they’re coming from.", "This is the type of legislation that actually shows respect for all Ontarians. In his speech, the member opposite said, “We’re not only here for the taxpayers.” Fair enough. But to say that not everyone pays taxes is a bit simplistic, and I don’t think it’s very honest. I don’t know anyone who hasn’t at some point, even if it’s just through buying a cup of coffee, had to pay taxes. No matter who you are, no matter whether you’re a new Canadian or someone who doesn’t make enough to pay income tax, there are taxes.

We need to invest it wisely, and when it’s public infrastructure, public education, public health care, that has to be raised through taxation. So to state what you’re going to do with the money you raise, or fail to raise, is as important as, if not more important than, simply saying you have to have a referendum if you’re going to raise taxes.", "We will take the member at his word, but in the last version of the Conservative platform, there was a $6-billion hole which was just going to be filled: “Well, we’ll find that from efficiencies.” Now that platform is no longer in place. We don’t know where—the new platform states that they are going to run on a balanced budget; there will be no tax increase. If they are going to state that, then they should be upfront and say where they are going to save that money or what services they are actually going to cut. Shouldn’t the parties have to state their case to the people regarding what money they’re not going to be able to invest in this province? That’s also part of the case. The NDP believes in public services. We believe that it takes money to invest in those public services.", "The Conservative Party seems to believe that that is not the case, that they should be able to hold the budget and not raise taxes on anything.

Contrary to the Liberal government, my colleagues and I in the Progressive Conservative caucus recognize that governments cannot tax themselves into prosperity. The late, great American President John F. Kennedy was a firm believer in this concept. He believed that cutting taxes created more opportunity for citizens by putting more money into their pockets and, by association, the economy.", "In his September 18, 1963, radio and television address to the American people, he had this to say:", "“A tax cut means higher family income and higher business profits and a balanced ... budget. Every taxpayer and his family will have more money left over after taxes for a new car, a new home, new conveniences, education, and investment....", "“Prosperity is the real way to balance our budget.... By lowering tax rates, by increasing jobs and income, we can expand tax revenues and bring finally our budget into balance.”", "This quote resonates as much today as it did nearly 60 years ago, particularly the point on expanding the economy as the key to increasing prosperity for both individuals and businesses. The reality today is that for 15 years, the Liberal government has made life harder for Ontario families. They are paying more and more and getting less.", "Speaker, I am going to be sharing my time with the member for Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound.

Kennedy: “It is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high ... and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now....

Let me tell you what I mean. Some of the members opposite spent their time talking about our fiscal record. It’s interesting to hear the PC Party talk about balanced budgets. It’s interesting because the PCs, during record economic growth in Ontario, the last time they were in office, most of the years they were in office, ran large deficits. You know what compounds the problem with that? They actually ran those deficits not only during times of record economic growth, when they were collecting record tax revenues, but they then cut taxes further, which further put us in a deficit. Then, in an election year, to balance the budget, they sold the 407 for an amount of money far below what it’s actually worth. These are the folks who are now lecturing us on how to manage tax dollars. These are the folks who are now saying, “We know finance and you don’t know finance.” So the hypocrisy, Speaker, is really disappointing.", "Now, just on this particular bill, I have to say that there is already legislation in place that requires that steps be taken for any taxes to be raised.", "Just to recap, the current Taxpayer Protection Act requires a referendum in order to increase a tax. That already exists. And if a government wishes to raise a tax, then that referendum can be bypassed. This can be done by passing a bill that amends the Taxpayer Protection Act to exempt the particular tax change from the referendum requirements.

Ontario does have legislation regarding personal information in the public sector in the form of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act; however, we are lagging behind provinces such as British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec in creating provincial legislation to regulate the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in the private sector. This bill seeks to give Ontario jurisdiction in developing legislation and regulations to protect personal information.", "Madam Speaker, the matter of personal information protection is gaining more and more attention in the media and in the tax sector, as well as different governments around the world.

This legislation attempts to strike a balance between the right of the individual to protect their personal information and the need of the organization to collect, use and disclose personal information that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.", "The collection of private information in the legislation is based on one core principle: the “reasonable person” test. The reasonable person test is commonly used in law. In simple terms, it asks whether or not the average person can reasonably understand the legislation. In upholding this legal principle, this bill is both transparent and accountable.", "The proposed legislation also takes into account the recommendations proposed by the Canadian Standards Association, or CSA, in regard to the protection of personal information. This bill addresses concerns in regard to accountability as well as openness and transparency. It also establishes a reasonable person test for how an organization collects, uses and discloses personal information.", "Madam Speaker, this bill, if passed, will require organizations to designate one or more individuals to make sure that the organization is following PIPA’s rules. It also states that an organization must make the identity and contact information of its privacy officer public, further enriching the values of openness and transparency.", "This bill ensures that information collected, used or disclosed by the organization must be consent-based. It prohibits organizations from collecting, using or disclosing personal information without consent. However, this does not apply if the act otherwise authorizes the collection, use or disclosure of the information. There are also rules for the provision of consent, implicit consent and the withdrawal of consent while also setting limitations on the use of personal information. It also governs situations in which personal information may be used without consent, such as medical emergencies or investigations.", "Finally, Madam Speaker, the proposed legislation provides exceptions as and when the personal information may be disclosed without consent in situations like the sale of the organization or its business assets for research, statistical, archival or historical purposes. A matter of importance for all businesses is how to handle both personal information of its customers and employees. This bill specifies what sort of information is considered employee personal information. The different levels of identifying purposes and consent-based collection are important in protecting the freedom and privacy of Ontarians.", "Individual access to private information is also a key factor in this bill, which lays out a process for individual requests as well as responsibilities for organizations to deal with these requests. An individual can also request to correct their private information, which is important if there’s an error or omission, which again is consistent with the CSA recommendation of accurate information.", "Correction and annotation procedures further enhance the transparency of this bill, which ensures that corrections are made in a quick manner and disclosed to every other organization which has been provided this incorrect or incomplete information.", "It also ensures that annotations are kept for the record in case information is deemed to be correct, and not changed, despite an individual’s request to do so, to improve transparency and accuracy.", "Finally, exception to access also uses the reasonable person test to allow an organization to refuse access to information under certain circumstances, such as ongoing investigations.", "Madam Speaker, the proposed legislation clearly defines and imposes time limits on organizations to respond to individuals’ written requests to access or correct their information. This legislation also provides direction regarding the minimum time period required for retention of personal information and for destruction of personal documents. Of irrefutable importance are the security safeguards mandated by this legislation, which include physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect Ontarians’ personal information.", "This bill also defines the role of the Information and Privacy Commissioner, who will be responsible for its implementation. The commissioner will also establish an advisory committee to assist him in investigating these complex personal information requests. The commissioner will have the authority to enforce the act, as a failure or refusal to co-operate with certain orders of the commissioner may make persons liable for contempt as if in breach of an order or judgment of the court. The commissioner will report to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly annually on his or her work under the act.", "Madam Speaker, this bill will take Ontario into the future in terms of legislation guarding personal information in the private sector as technological innovations continue to be invented and evolve in our society and business sector.", "Yet again I would like to quote the CEO of Microsoft. Mr. Nadella expressed this notion very clearly in his book, where he wrote, “Every wave of technological change has required us to reaffirm the values that undergird protections against unlawful research and seizure and develop new ways to protect them.”", "He continues by saying, “Benjamin Franklin’s creation of the US postal service quickly led to mail fraud—and to laws against it. The telegraph led to wire fraud and eavesdropping—and laws designed to prevent them. Today’s devices, the cloud, and artificial intelligence will be used both for good and for evil. Now it is our generation’s turn to design legal and regulatory systems that will discourage and punish the evil while encouraging the good to flourish—and to do so in such a fashion that will enhance the overall level of trust in society as a whole.”", "The proposed legislation is born out of a desire to meet this challenge and provide a framework for future generations to be able to change laws based on a public mandate that will deal with the issues which we may not have thought about in this legislation. As such, I hope that this bill will have bipartisan support for the benefit of the business sector in Ontario as well as each and every individual in this province." ],

There was Bell Canada back in January, where a data breach appears to have compromised about 100,000 customers’ names and email addresses—thankfully, not their credit card or banking information. Uber Canada last November: 815,000 Canadian riders and drivers may have been affected as part of Uber’s worldwide data breach; and a cyber security breach at Equifax left millions of people vulnerable.", "All companies, including social media, must do better to protect people’s privacy and personal data, and they can do this by becoming accountable and transparent about how they deal with our data.", "I do want to say that, as important and timely as Bill 14 is, it was not consulted on, and I sincerely hope the member from Mississauga–Erindale will do a full consensus to ensure that everyone has their say and we do provide good legislation which would be in keeping with the spirit of this bill.", "I support Bill 14 in principle and look forward to it moving forward.

There have been complaints over the years that that has been a major challenge.", "What hasn’t been dealt with as much is the obtaining and sharing of information that individuals happen to provide.

I see that they want to bring the head of Facebook before a legislative committee—in this case, I think, a committee of the House or the Senate in the United States—to explain how a breach of this kind can take place. It worries people, because we see now, with all of the ways of communicating electronically, the ability of people to influence elections, and that can happen anywhere. There’s a case before the United States at the present time.

I think it’s important that businesses do that, because they have a vested interest in obtaining all kinds of information about any one of us.", "It takes back jurisdiction from the federal government on personal information matters in the private sector.

It in no way prevents government from providing that information when asked by a freedom-of-information access request to be provided as it should.

It lacks the stakeholder consultation that a bill of this nature demands. While I support it at second reading, this bill needs extensive consultation in committee to ensure that we get this right. Its rapid introduction did not allow stakeholders to come forward and inform this House of the benefits and the pitfalls in this bill.", "I would also like to comment that this bill does not reflect the current practices of this government, and that is unfortunate. I was approached by a not-for-profit organization in my riding of Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry that is providing public services. They were ordered by the ministry to release the names and contact information of all their employees to another organization without consent of the employees themselves.", "Speaker, this is just another example of the government saying one thing but quietly doing another.

This is a long, complicated bill, and time was a constraint. Obviously, I wouldn’t want it to become a law before we all took a closer look at the wording of this bill. Further research could really be done, but again, we were under the gun on this one, especially because something like rules around privacy should be addressed with a government bill, backed by the ministry, with all the supports and the resources that come with it.", "There are a lot of exceptions and exclusions in this bill, and we wouldn’t want to create a law which has unintended consequences.

That’s why I think this should have been a government bill and not a private member’s bill. Asking these questions is a government exercise, and I’m afraid that the Liberal government is not taking privacy issues seriously enough.", "Like I’ve said, we all saw what happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. I didn’t see anything in this bill that would actually address this problem or anything of that sort. It’s important that we ask people what they expect and how they want to be protected.", "Today, we have a very different relationship with personal information.

However, I’m not sure what this bill is doing and what problems it solves. We are in need of better and more adaptive privacy laws, but I don’t think this bill will do very much towards that. However, I want to note that with this bill, the Information and Privacy Commissioner would be responsible for monitoring how the act is administered and ensuring that its proposals are achieved.", "I think it is a good thing, but will the commissioner have more resources? And is this bill actually clear enough for them to understand, for them to do the actual job?", "Again, I commend the member and his staff for having done the work on this bill. I think this is also a good idea, but if it’s going to fill in the gaps, I think there’s a lot more that we can do.", "I support the intent of the bill, Speaker. I’m going to be looking at it and hopefully studying it even more because, let’s face it, with what recently happened over the news, personal privacy information has come to a heightened concern with the public right now.

It’s not just Ontario, or even just Canada or just the continent. What we do here in Ontario—we might have the best of intentions, but it’s not so easy when data is being stored outside of Ontario by companies that don’t necessarily do much business in Ontario.", "I want to speak more on a personal note as the PC critic for children, youth and families. We saw at committee that there was grave concern from the public about privacy in the child welfare system, because they now have uploaded the data on—most of the children’s aid societies are moving forward with it; some have completed it. They’ve moved forward with what we call CPIN, which is a program to allow the child welfare agencies to share information.", "Obviously, that’s very important, Madam Speaker, because if a family is of concern to child welfare authorities and then they move to another region where there is a different society, we need to ensure that the information is being shared, just like information is being shared by our law enforcement and information was supposed to be shared by our health care professionals through eHealth. That didn’t work out as well as we wanted. But the fact is that there are children who age out of care—they’re no longer in care—and they raised concerns about what is going to be done with their data once they’re no longer in care. They are very worried about it.", "The minister was asked to come to committee to address some of the concerns. That didn’t happen, unfortunately.", "Now, here we are, not even a year after the bill was implemented to update the child welfare system, and here we hear of two children’s aid service agencies that fell victim to cyber-ransomware attacks. One was the Children’s Aid Society of Oxford County. They paid a $5,000 ransom to regain access to their sensitive data after a malware attack on their local servers. You can say that that’s not directly related to CPIN and you would be right, but the fact is, they were trying to upload their data from their present system to CPIN and it wasn’t a secure server, so they lost their data and they had to pay to get it back.", "There was another agency, Family and Children’s Services of Lanark, Leeds and Grenville, which saw a ransom message flash on their computer screens demanding $60,000 when they tried to access their database. They ended up negotiating through their insurance and they were able to deal with it.", "Madam Speaker, we cannot implement a new CPIN system without realizing that these children’s aid societies are not computer-savvy necessarily and that the government is required to help them ensure that the data is protected.", "So I’m really happy to hear more about what the members here in the House have to say about this bill. I think that we certainly are concerned about our own privacy. Now that we’re going to an election time, we’re all collecting data, I’m sure: identifying our voters, our supporters and our donors. We are certainly required to ensure that that data is safe, so we must make sure that we respect everybody’s data." ],

I’m obviously very happy to have her in the gallery today to watch this debate, though I hope it is a chorus of agreement about the parchment on which our democracy stands.", "I would also like to take a moment to thank fellow members of provincial Parliament for standing to discuss this historically significant document with me. No matter what party banner we run under come election time and no matter what caucus we sit in today, I think we can all agree that there is much to celebrate in the Magna Carta.", "I would also be remiss not to mention Leonard and Suzy Rodness, who, although they are unable to join us on such short notice, are here in spirit. They played a leading role in bringing the physical Magna Carta to Canada, for which we should all be grateful.", "I can’t say that I expected a third opportunity to introduce and share this bill, but if there’s one piece of good news that I am able to take from the government’s decision to briefly prorogue, it is that new ballot slots were drawn and mine came up third.", "I relied heavily on Dr. Harris’s book, Magna Carta and Its Gifts to Canada, in my research on this important topic. As I mentioned earlier, we are lucky to have her in the gallery today. I encourage those of you who would like to know the full story to read her book when you have the chance.", "The bill we have before us asks the assembly to recognize June 15 as Magna Carta Day. The reason for that is simple: Magna Carta stands out as a unique example of men working together for the greater good. While its rights were laid out as expectations to be followed by specific social groups, such as the barons and the knights, it was flexible enough to include commoners as time went on; it also recognized women.", "But today there is a threat to the principles of Magna Carta in a way never imagined by its authors. Yes, these rights still exist in the legal sense, but what about in the day-to-day operations of public life? The right to be innocent until proven guilty is being drowned by social media and the court of public opinion, an unaccountable social media mob that can destroy in minutes, if not seconds.", "You may wonder why, 800 years later, Magna Carta still matters. Eight hundred years later, why does it matter that a king agreed to meet his most influential barons on a field in England to sign a document that he intended to tear up?", "It matters that circumstances prevented King John from tearing it up. It matters that those nobles made sure that the English population knew the principles contained in the document and that they would provide a protection for rights and responsibilities for generations to follow; that those principles would come to all parts of the world, including America, France, and the Commonwealth, including Canada, of course.", "Eight hundred years later, it still matters; however, 800 years is a very long time. The wealthy were starting to build their homes from stone; the poor lived in homes with thatched roofs, and fires were common. People couldn’t read; they couldn’t write. Many children did not reach adulthood, due to illness or accident. If you weren’t a member of the church hierarchy, you were one of the few wealthy nobles, but more likely than not, you were a peasant or a gamin.", "King John agreed to sign, believing he could nullify the work done by a relatively small group of lords a short while later, but this was not to be. As the principles took hold amongst people of all social classes, the ideas were embraced. Judges made sure that people understood the meaning and the implication of the various concepts. While at the time it was not divided into clauses, it was clear what ideas were to be found and, later, what ideas were here to stay.", "But now there is a new message from Magna Carta for each of us: the clear importance of innocence until proven guilty. While today there may be Canadians who do not know what Magna Carta is, I think we can all agree that we know what it means to live under its influence. The concept of equality before the law is a Canadian value. In a world overwhelmed by political instability, corruption and war, the stability of Magna Carta shines brightly. As nations define human rights in their own jurisdictions, Magna Carta informs that process locally and at the international level.", "Magna Carta has been interpreted by many throughout its long history. It has had an influence on millions of people. The basic principles have not changed: No one is above the law; there is a right to due process and a right to trial by peers. I began by asking, “Eight hundred years later, why does it matter?” Today, there are millions of people who don’t have these rights.", "The purpose of this bill is twofold. First, it is to remind people of the principles of Magna Carta and how important it is to protect these from neglect and abuse. Second, this bill recognizes the universality of Magna Carta, as it has influenced constitutions and legal thinking in many countries around the world.", "I want to thank you for joining me here today to discuss this bill and for your support of Canada’s democratic principles." ],

Specifically today, we are debating the reintroduced private member’s bill to make June 15 of every year Magna Carta Day.", "“Magna Carta” is Latin for “Great Charter,” and it is one of the most important documents in political history. It has been described as England’s greatest export, first drawn up and signed by King John on June 15, 1215, to make peace between the unpopular king and a group of rebel barons, limiting the powers of the monarchy under the Angevin kings and, in particular, during John’s reign.", "It was the first document forced onto a king of England by his subjects with the objective of protecting their privileges and limiting his powers. The Magna Carta stands as a document defending and declaring the rule of law. It tells the story of noble barons who fought against the cruel tyrant King John, in defence of English liberty.", "It must be recognized, along with that story, that the 99% from that time was comprised of serfs and the peasantry, who were not free to fight for liberty. They were the masses, oppressed by the nobles and the system, who did not benefit from the Magna Carta initially.", "Also, around the world some communities did not live as serfs and did not live with owners, so they may not have needed a written document outlining the basics of democratic ideals. We shouldn’t always point to ourselves as the only model for civilization and community structure.", "Not all important documents are regal, written documents. Some were treaties and some, like the Dish With One Spoon wampum belt covenant, were agreements among our First Nations and allied nations. Here at Queen’s Park, we are on sacred land, where historical covenants and agreements haven’t been respected or honoured, and we must strive to recognize and work for meaningful reconciliation with all our relations. Remember that not all important history is written on parchment.", "However, the Magna Carta stands as a written flashpoint that has lit the fires of challenge and justice, inspiring the truly oppressed around the world. The Magna Carta represents equality before the law, trial by peers, immunity from illegal imprisonment and taxation only by the consent of the citizenry.", "Speaker, I’d like to go back in history a little further, to William the Conqueror and his youngest son, King Henry I. At that time, only a noble widow had control of her property and marital status. King Henry I ensured that widows of knights and barons would receive an inheritance and the freedom to choose whether they remarried or not. However, King Richard and younger brother King John wanted more income, ignored the protections set by King Henry, and confiscated widows’ inheritances who refused to marry friends and supporters of the king. This upset the barons and nobles because it upset the social hierarchy.", "Enshrined in the Magna Carta are rights for women. Though limited to noble widows, clause 7 ensures a widow’s pension, and clause 8 states, “No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she wishes to remain without a husband.”", "Interestingly, my very first private member’s bill, Bill 98, also protected widows’ pensions from insurance companies trying to claw them back after their husbands had died of occupational workplace diseases. It’s interesting that the more things change, the more they really stay the same.", "I’d also like to take us back, in my own history in this Legislature—not quite as far back as the Magna Carta, but it still seems like a lifetime ago—to my very first day at this Legislature as an elected member of provincial Parliament. It was at our orientation back in June 2014, learning the building, learning the ropes and appreciating the history that we were stepping into. I remember, as we were walking through these halls, there were women wearing dresses and hats from the early 1900s walking towards us, silently walking along the halls. It was a very surreal moment. I asked the other new MPPs, “Can you see them?” And they could, because they weren’t ghosts remembering these halls. They were actors and extras filming a Murdoch Mysteries episode. They were re-enacting a suffragettes’ rally on the steps of Queen’s Park, demanding the right to vote. So there I was, walking alongside suffragettes at Queen’s Park, 100 years later, as a woman taking her place as an elected member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.", "White women were allowed to vote only 100 years ago, in 1917. Racialized women, group by group, had to fight to be allowed in the 1940s, and it wasn’t until 1954 that indigenous women achieved the right to vote.", "When we look around this room, we see that we still have a ways to go to see elected representation that is reflective of our diverse province. I wonder how many folks in positions of elected power are the descendants of barons and nobles. I don’t think that I am, because my mother used to tell me that we were the descendants of lowland Scottish sheep thieves—but I digress.", "I am glad when we talk about democracy, but I’m even more glad when we challenge that democracy and when we actually delve into it to say that democracy is not just about challenging power; it is about who has that power.", "The real story, still being written, is about who isn’t allowed access to that power. The Magna Carta started the journey to our Eurocentric version of democracy, but it cannot stop there. We must never be a part of a government system that denies justice or access to human rights. And we can’t just point to the Magna Carta; we must direct it and target injustice." ],

It’s really a reminder that, even when something is started, there’s a potential for it to grow and to spread.

That day sticks out in my mind because that was Emancipation Day. When I visit schools in my riding, as I regularly do, I talk about that day and I share that information with young people, because it’s important that we remember those struggles that were really hard-fought-for and that we recognize that discrimination and intolerance are something we have to do away with in our society.", "Just yesterday, March 21, we celebrated the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. That day is important because, in 1960, police officers in Sharpeville, South Africa, opened fire and killed 69 people who were rising up against a divisive regime of apartheid.", "Visiting South Africa and seeing the townships, visiting the museums and looking at that history, you recognize that democracy is something that is fought for. It is something that we earn and that we have to fight hard to keep and to make sure that everyone in our society here in Ontario is participating fully and completely in the benefits of our society. That is why our government has set up the Anti-Racism Directorate, led by my colleague the minister responsible for the Anti-Racism Directorate, the Honourable Michael Coteau. It’s important to have those offices that can dig deeply into our society and say, “Who is not being included fully? Whose rights are being violated in our inclusive society?”", "This historic document truly does remind us that the true power in any democracy like ours resides in the people. It resides very much in the will of all of the people. When we are in this House and have this privilege to stand and to pass laws and to develop policy, we have to keep that at the centre of our decision-making and recognize that the greatest aspect of our country—here in Ontario and right across—is the fact that we live in a society that is free, that we live in a society that enshrines in our Charter those freedoms, and that we can build on what was done in the past; but we have to do it in a way that reflects everyone’s rights and everyone’s values. That is, indeed, a privilege.", "I want to say thank you again to the member from York–Simcoe for bringing this forward and giving us an opportunity in June to celebrate the Magna Carta and to really expand on it, to talk about what it means to us today in our society: those ideals of freedom and full inclusion for all people and how we must continue to fight for that and we must continue to value that.", "I really want to thank the member from Oshawa for bringing up the First Nations and indigenous peoples of this land. We know that we have the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that looks at some of the injustices that have taken place over the years. But it doesn’t stop there.

I’m going to say a piece of history about her, which was that we just celebrated her as the longest-serving female legislator in Ontario history, and her portrait now hangs on the wall on the first floor. Magna Carta is Latin for the Great Charter. It’s a revolutionary document that forms the bedrock of constitutional monarchies, such as Ontario and Canada. In 1215, King John sealed the Magna Carta, limiting his own powers. He painted himself into a corner, as it were. He signed a document which, before he signed the document, it would have been within his powers to rip up the document. But once he signed the document, he was sort of stuck with it, even though he regretted it almost immediately. It, of course, enshrines the supremacy of law and reason.", "We understand here, and we say it often, but I think we have to remind ourselves that nobody is above the law—not the king, not the Premier, not the Prime Minister.

Of course, we talk about democracy, but it’s much more than just voting every four years. It’s an ongoing process, and we have to ensure that we protect it.", "Unfortunately, democracy is fragile. We have seen some polls recently where millennials were asked if it was important to them or not, and they did not rate democracy as particularly necessary or important to them. That’s quite scary. I think it’s quite scary to all of us here, and it just reminds me of the expression, “you don’t know what you have until it’s gone”.

Most of us are old enough to remember that before we were able to google everything, we actually had to go to a library and sometimes look things up on microfiche—I’m sure that if you asked the millennials, some of them don’t even know what that is—and how hard it was to do research, when we had a university project, to get the information.", "Now we have information at our fingertips, and I hope that we all appreciate all the information that’s available to us. If anybody is watching at home and they want more information on the Magna Carta, there are books, as we heard, to read—and let us know what your thoughts are, in terms of how important democracy and due process are to you.", "This bill, of course, isn’t just an act to commemorate some day in history.

The first is that of the establishment. It praises gradual reform, the slow extension of liberties and the gradual encroachment of the citizenry upon the sovereign power of the king. It tells of noble barons who fought the good fight in defence of English liberty against the cruel and capricious tyrant King John.”", "And, apparently, “there is some truth in this. The rights won by the nobility in the Magna Carta paved the way for the parliamentary system, were eventually extended to all persons, not just free men”—and I underline “men”—“and in the 17th were invoked to check Charles I’s attempt to establish an absolute monarchy.", "“But there is a darker side to the story too. The nobility were oppressed by the king, but they were the oppressors of the whole English society,” as my colleague from Oshawa alluded to earlier. “The serfs and peasants who lived under the nobility’s arbitrary power received little from the Magna Carta, initially, at least, for the Magna Carta was, in its day, a charter” for the top 1%, the well-connected. “To the oppressed 99% of English society, the nobles said, ‘Liberty for me, but not for thee.’", "“That brings me to the second story of the Magna Carta. In this story, the Magna Carta has inspired the truly oppressed around the world. For eight centuries, the Magna Carta has fired the hearts and minds of those who seek justice in the face of tyranny and exploitation. The oppressed of the world have taken the Magna Carta as a totem in their demands for equality before the law, trial by their peers, immunity from illegal imprisonment and taxation only by the consent of the citizenry.", "“During the English Civil War, the Levellers drew on the Magna Carta’s promise of equality before the law as grounds for an equal and classless society. It inspired the American revolutionaries and abolitionists alike. It influenced the Chartist movement in 19th-century England, which sought one man/one vote, no property qualification and the secret ballot.” If they’d gone just another step further, one woman/one vote, I think they would have been pretty close to where we had to be.", "“Nelson Mandela cited the Magna Carta in his defence at the Rivonia trial.

For as long as governments act above the law, act arbitrarily and deny justice for their peoples, the Magna Carta will retain its significance.”", "Again, my thanks to the member for bringing this forward as a reminder of the bedrock of the principles that we put forward for establishment of the operation of a democratic society.", "“We in the House are tasked with drafting the law, the government ... is tasked with executing the law, but none of us here are above that law.

I spoke a little bit about my concern with the fact that it struck from the agenda, and struck from the table, some of these really excellent measures that were brought forward by private members—one of the reasons why the member for York–Simcoe had to reintroduce her bill this afternoon was because of the prorogation of the House—as well as, unfortunately, the piece of legislation that I brought forward, my first private member’s bill, the Compassionate Care Act.", "Quite frankly, as important as private members’ business is, I think it’s very important that we look at the actions of the government, not only our own particular legislation that we’ve deemed to be important to ourselves and our communities, but what the government has been doing for 15 years.", "Quite honestly, the government legacy is one of debt, it’s one of scandal, it’s one of waste and mismanagement and it’s one that, frankly, they don’t seem to be too proud of. I think it’s fair to say that when we heard the throne speech, you would have thought that the province was in a greater mess than what, after 15 years, they seem to have created.", "Unfortunately, what we see not only across the province but in my particular area is a lack, on behalf of the government, of really good governance. As former Premier Bill Davis said, good governance is a very basic thing. It’s not new, it’s not exciting and it’s not particularly sexy, but an important part of the duty that we perform here is simply that process of good governance.", "I haven’t had the chance to speak with former Premier Bill Davis, but I think it’s fair to say that if we look at the examples of Liberal waste that they’ve brought forward over the past 15 years and the amount of neglect of taxpayers’ dollars that they’ve demonstrated—whether it’s $8 billion on eHealth, as the Auditor General described in 2016, or $1.1 billion for cancelling gas plants to try to save a couple of Liberal seats; whether it’s a $4.5-million salary for the CEO of Hydro One or $2 billion on smart meters, as the Auditor General detailed in her 2014 report—it’s clear that this government does not have an income problem; they don’t have a revenue problem; they have a spending problem.", "I think that’s also one of the things we can see, as we’re heading into an election: that this government is more than willing to throw around taxpayer dollars in significant ways without perhaps recognizing the cost and the sacrifice that people have had to make in order to pay those taxes. These are dollars that are precious resources that have been entrusted to this government by the citizens of Ontario. I think it’s really unfortunate that as we look at this $8 billion on eHealth and the $1.1 billion on gas plants, there’s no money for some other very important projects.", "In my local constituency, what I want to talk about specifically is the new West Lincoln Memorial Hospital that is long overdue in the Niagara region. When I think of the various government promises that we saw heading into budget week next week from this throne speech, I have a little bit of skepticism. I’m not going to lie. I doubt perhaps the government’s ability to actually follow through with some of these broad promises.", "It’s easy to talk about providing the sun, the moon and the stars, as it seems to me they’re willing to do on the taxpayers’ dime, but when we look at 15 years, what have they actually accomplished? I think this is a prime case, if you look at the West Lincoln Memorial Hospital, of the sorts of broken promises that the Liberals have actually held.", "What we saw with the West Lincoln Memorial Hospital was that, in 2004, shortly after forming this government, the Liberal government called the redevelopment of the West Lincoln Memorial Hospital a priority.", "I want to back up and say that this hospital was built in 1948. We’ve had members in this Legislature stand up and speak about their local hospitals that were built in the 1960s and 1970s and that needed development and redevelopment. The fact that in 2004 the government called the redevelopment a priority and today, 14 years later, we haven’t seen any real action on this is, quite frankly, disturbing and a sad statement on the worth of Liberal promises.", "The government promised in 2005 that construction on the West Lincoln Memorial Hospital would begin by 2009. Then the Liberal government promised that shovels would be in the ground by 2011. The next promise was that redevelopment would begin in 2013. You just keep moving the yardstick.", "When the first promise was made, in 2004, I was seven years old. I must say that I was born in that hospital myself, but at the time I was born, in 1997, people were already raising money and looking forward to the redevelopment of this hospital. It was something that we expected in the near future. Some 20 years later, I’m now fighting for the same hospital that my predecessor fought for for 22 years.", "After promising that construction would begin in 2009, and then 2011, and then 2013, the government’s 2012 budget actually cancelled the project completely. Unfortunately, it seems that the only sure guarantee of a new hospital is a new government, and I think that’s something that constituents in my riding have recognized. We even saw it, unfortunately, in the by-election, where we saw politics that are being played with people’s health. We had the Liberal candidate in that by-election say, “The only way you can get a new hospital is if you elect a Liberal.” I think that spoke to a mentality that we’ve seen, where the Liberals are using targeted taxpayer dollars to campaign for re-election. They’re trying to paper over the type of negligence and waste that we’ve seen over the past 15 years and hope that people will just kind of have it disappear, that they won’t remember all of the broken promises.", "It’s actually remarkable. My predecessor, Tim Hudak, had over 8,000 people who showed up to a rally for this hospital at Grimsby Secondary School in my riding, but the Liberals just haven’t paid any attention. I’m very, very disappointed with that, and I look forward to being part of a strong PC government that will actually take meaningful action on health care.", "Going back to the throne speech: Although the throne speech discussed at length various new spending measures and attempts to gloss over the last 15 years—I’m not even going to get into the debt and deficit part of it. I think we can go on and expand about the fact that debt today is tomorrow’s taxes, unfortunately. But one of the things is that they practically ignored the need for economic growth. The topic only really came up toward the end of the throne speech, and then it was primarily only discussed as a means to an end of supplying the government with the funds that they want.", "They didn’t have a lot to say in the throne speech about how the government is planning to encourage this growth. They didn’t say much except for spending more money and supporting regional investments and job funds in struggling regions of the province, which is not in and of itself a bad thing. But I think the Liberals are good at talking about these broad, general, “We’re going to do good things. We’re going to fix it all. Don’t worry, we’ve got everything figured out”—yet at the end of the day, the throne speech still had that air of desperation, that aura of not being sure what the best steps are to take.", "So there does remain a clear and obvious need for policy reforms to help encourage sustainable economic growth. In my portfolio as associate critic for research, innovation and technology, I meet a lot of people who speak about—whether it’s through our tax burden or unpredictability—a brain drain to the United States. They speak about a lack of access to capital here to grow their tech companies, a lack of access to talent, to a certain extent. I would say, to quite a large extent, a lot of the responsibility for this lack of access to talent and capital lies with this Liberal government.", "This throne speech is a desperate attempt from a tired Liberal government to hit reset and try to mislead voters, perhaps, about the intent of—" ],

I’m pretty sure I’m hearing that at the doorsteps in my community,” because people recognize that this throne speech, as the member said, has an air of desperation and it feels kind of like a last-ditch attempt.

He was going to take a bulldozer to the rules, and he was going to shove garbage into the Adams mine regardless of whether it was safe or not. That’s how I got here, and that’s why I will continue to fight against that type of language and that type of attitude.", "But getting back to the throne speech, on behalf of Ontarians, you have to wonder what the throne speech was really for. It gave some work to the trumpeters—the trumpets were great—but the idea of a throne speech is to set the course of a government. After the election, you set the course of the government and tell what your plans are. This didn’t set the course of the government; it was a reset to try to change the channel. They replaced “openness and transparency” with “care and”—complacency? No, care and something else. But it was more of a marketing exercise. All they were trying to do was to change the channel in a media cycle. They spent all this time and money, and they’re just trying to flip the media cycle for a day or a week.", "That shows how tired and cynical this government has become, and that shows that truly this province does need, in the words of my colleague, change for the better." ],

The first one says, “Ontario Throne Speech Another Set of Empty Promises.” No matter where you sit on the political spectrum, I think it’s fair to say that it is indeed another set of empty promises. It’s attempting to make up for 15 years of bad governance, and I think Ontarians have seen through that façade and will hopefully also make that known when they mark their X on June 7.", "However, the other one is “Ontario’s Throne Speech Ignores Growth And Competitiveness.” It cites a study that saw that “between 2007 and 2016, Ontario’s private sector created fewer jobs, on average, each year than all but two provinces,” New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. So Ontario was beneath the national average and near the bottom of the pack on three other indicators of economic progress, on all other counts as well. I think this is a pretty scathing indictment of the government’s policies over the past 15 years. Having a decade of lost growth is really a tragedy for the prosperity and economic opportunity of our province.", "I got involved in politics, as well, because I believe it’s important for young people to be able to get ahead. I believe it’s important for young people to be able to graduate and find good jobs, to pursue educations that lead to meaningful careers. Unfortunately, under this Liberal government, there are a lot of young people—I think of my peers who are coming out of university—who are looking at precarious employment. It’s difficult to buy a house, it’s difficult to get into a career, and I would say that that’s the legacy of the last 15 years. This throne speech won’t change that." ],

If it wasn’t for the people of Grassy Narrows and some really excellent reporting by the Toronto Star, where they went out and they took soil samples and they detected buried barrels, we’d still be under the impression from this government that this is a problem that is going to solve itself over time. Well, no, that’s not true. It isn’t going to solve itself over time.", "We had the Premier and her minister stalling month after month after month while people continued to be subjected to mercury poisoning. What kind of reconciliation is that? What kind of reconciliation is it when an obvious instance of poisoning is not addressed forthrightly and honestly?", "Not only that, but the people of Grassy Narrows asked for what they called a “mercury home,” a care facility in their community. The people who had been poisoned, who had lost motor control of their hands and feet, who were suffering neurological damage, asked for a care home in their community so that people wouldn’t have to go 100 kilometres away to a care facility where they were isolated from family and friends and, as some of them said to me, die alone. How were they greeted? They were given no promise. They were given no commitment, when a community went through decades of being poisoned.", "When you talk about “build and rebuild those partnerships here in Ontario” with First Nations and you ignore people who are poisoned, then you are not credible on this issue. You are not credible on this issue.", "The government, on the next page, talks about the “impulse to care for each other, alive in our communities every day.” Frankly, Speaker, I won’t argue with that because I can say, whether it’s in Whitby, Scarborough, Oshawa, Peterborough, Etobicoke, Markham, Brampton or Ajax, all over this province, that I am constantly amazed at people’s willingness to extend themselves and actually help their neighbours. They don’t have to be close family, but there’s a very profound, basic decency in the people of this province that I always marvel at and, frankly, I think is something to cherish. It’s a wonderful thing. That statement is correct. I don’t argue with that statement. In fact, I’m very glad I live in a province where I see that—actually, I’ll digress.", "I had some relatives come from Latvia a few years ago. They were in downtown Toronto—they had never been in North America—and they got lost. The thing that astounded them, with very limited English, is how people would come up to them and say, “You look lost. Where do you need to get to?” They would direct them. They just said, “We’ve not experienced that back at home. It’s amazing to us to experience it here.” It made me feel very good about this province. That part I think is a fair claim.", "The speech goes on to talk about the response to unprecedented flooding in Brantford, Ottawa and southwestern Ontario. Speaker, you can’t attribute any one extreme weather event to climate change, but we’re in a situation where, as the world gets hotter and the world’s weather changes, we will see more and more catastrophic flooding. Yet this government has had a very poor record in acting on climate, far below what’s necessary to actually protect this population and contribute fairly to the globally necessary effort to take this on.", "I was around in 2008 for the debate on the cap-and-trade bill then.

We passed the bill and it died, consigned to a back room somewhere, probably recycled.

I think it was in 2016, if my memory serves me correctly, that we had the next debate on cap-and-trade. I’m glad that we did, because we do have to take action. But Speaker, the way things have been set up in Ontario, even going by the government’s own consultants, we won’t come close to meeting the climate protection targets that were set—not even close. That is scandalous, because if you say that something is really important—if you see the example of people being flooded out of their homes or having their homes destroyed by tornadoes and you still don’t act or you act inadequately, then you can’t claim the moral high ground. You simply cannot.", "We met our climate targets in 2014-15 because we had a recession. Shutting down coal plants was a good thing to do. All three parties were committed to that. It helped. But it was the recession and the restructuring of the economy in this province that allowed us to meet our targets, not programs that were put in place. We still don’t have the programs in place that would actually allow us to meet our climate targets. They’re not there.", "When you look at the documents put out by the government, the expectation is that the buying of carbon allowances from California will demonstrate that we’ve met the target. In medieval Europe, people were able to buy indulgences for their sins. It didn’t mean they stopped sinning, but it meant they had to pay. Buying a carbon allowance, part of a larger system, can be very useful. It should be in place. But it’s not a substitute for actually reducing emissions. This government has gone on to hope that those purchases of indulgences will give it the moral authority for saying that it has done something about climate when in fact it has fallen far, far short of what has to happen.", "Speaker, that part of the speech was disturbing to me.", "I want to also talk about the problem cited in this bill: that for many of our friends and neighbours, life is getting harder. Speaker, I don’t know if you were here in 2007. You may have been; I can’t remember. But I was elected in a by-election in March of 2006. In the fall of 2006, my colleague Cheri DiNovo started a campaign for a $10-an-hour minimum wage. Minimum wage was seven bucks at the time.", "I remember Cheri DiNovo asking questions of the Premier, asking questions of the Minister of Labour, asking questions of this government about when they were going to move on that issue. What was it going to take? And she was dismissed. She was told that she was completely out to lunch, that “We aren’t going to go to 10 bucks an hour; the economy of Ontario will collapse; don’t even think about it.” But happily, and this is why I love democracy—man, if it wasn’t for elections, nothing would ever happen in any society. But elections happen, and in February of 2006, there was a by-election in York South–Weston. We had a very good candidate, Paul Ferreira, and I went out and I campaigned for Paul. My guess is that a number of people who are in this House now were out on that campaign.

In 2016, the NDP came out and said, “Fifteen bucks an hour minimum wage.” Mike Crawley from the CBC wrote a really good story in about January or February of 2017, where he’d interviewed Premier Wynne and asked her, “What about this $15-an-hour minimum wage?” “No, no,” she says, “we don’t need that. What we’ve got is a solid plan. We’re going to continue on that plan. We’ll be good. Everything is fine.” Until, of course, the fall of 2017, when the polling numbers came in and they showed this black abyss opening up underneath the Premier. Suddenly, “Hey, a $15-an-hour minimum wage? That sounds pretty good to me,” says Premier Wynne.", "When a government is in peril, and this one is, sometimes good things happen. This is a good thing, going to a $15-an-hour minimum wage. I’m glad that we came out and fought for it.

We had a strike last fall, and we’ve got a strike going on at York University right now. My partner is taking a course at George Brown. When she started that course last fall, one of her instructors had been hired that day to teach the course. She hadn’t known about it because, as a part-time, sessional person, they’re only told at the last minute.

So we see the strikes at community colleges; we see the strikes at universities. When you squeeze people hard enough, they fight back.", "Although I will say this: I got an email this week from one of my constituents. He is a part-time instructor. In fact, he and his wife are both people with masters’ who are teaching part time in the community college system. He, in this case, had his hours cut back; and she, who was making less than him before, is now making about the same as him. But both of them just feel a complete sense of desperation. They cannot hold it all together.", "So when you talk about compassion for those who are dealing with part-time, precarious work, and you’re the one who’s making sure that that’s the way the system operates, you don’t have any credibility. Yes, there’s a problem. The government created it. We’re going to talk about it, but are you actually going to change your policies and change your budgets so that people who teach, who give the skills to the next generation, are going to be able to themselves live decent, stable lives and be able to invest in course development in a way that we need to have happen?", "Speaker, there’s a lot in that speech from the throne that deserves a very critical eye.

I still remember Whitby as the Dr. J.O. Ruddy hospital, where a good doctor came and looked after the 10 Dickson children. Thank God for my parents.", "I’m just going to touch on a few items, if I could, and that is, when we get to an age of 65 or over—it’s so appropriate that what has come forward in legislation is helping those who need the help the most. It’s important to all three parties, I’m sure, who have members, have friends and have family who are 65 and over, and so much of this is just so important to every one of those people. It’s ironical because, being the oldest of 10 children, of the 10 brothers and sisters, I can tell you that some of them are now getting to the point where they’re 65 and over and they could certainly use that assistance.", "We know the costs of health can cause anxiety and stress, especially for people 65 and over. We are often required to take multiple medications. That’s normal, because the older you get, the more you need. We all want the best care for our parents and grandparents, which is why we are expanding OHIP+ to make prescription drugs free for people 65 and over.", "When my parents didn’t have that coverage, with the 10 children, we all chipped in to make sure that our parents were taken care of, loved and appropriately visited on an ongoing basis as they became residents of long-term-care facilities.", "Beginning in August 2019, we will have more than 4,400 prescription drugs that will be available free of charge to everyone 65 and over. That is, as we all know, a growing number and assisting our population all the more. Yes, there will be no copayment and no deductible.", "It’s ironical: Every second Sunday now, when I come out of St. Bernadette’s church after mass, I have one or two ladies confront me and say, “There is a charge when you get your medical card back and get it renewed once a year.” As a matter of fact, they were very specific; they tell me in the month of August. I mentioned it to the Premier today in caucus and she said, “You know, Joe, that’s already approved, that’s already under way and that’s being eliminated.” That officially becomes eliminated in 2019. And I look forward to speaking to—I might go to mass twice on Sunday so I can tell them twice.", "This expansion will make life more affordable for 2.6 million seniors and their families. That’s a lot of people in Ontario. It will result in prescription drugs being there for nearly one in every two Ontarians. This makes us much closer to the goal of pharmacare for the people of Ontario.", "I’m just, right off the top of my head, trying to jot down a couple of things that are happening with us in long-term care and additional health services. As I go up the street, there’s a brand new clinic open in the Central East LHIN. That’s a major facility and very convenient for seniors. There are so many growth areas in health care being provided when you get to Durham region.", "I recall a gentleman, a very active Christian gentleman by the name of John Overzed. He was very active in the Glen Hill Terrace project, which is Whitby. I know both the parliamentary assistant to health and long-term care, John Fraser, and I were there. That’s getting close to completion. That’s just off Highway 12 as you come through Whitby.", "In Ajax, we’re just so busy. There has been a process going on for a long-term-care home called Balleycliffe lodge. It is with the Chartwell group. It’s right across the road from my constituency office. One of the little things they are changing dramatically in health care for seniors: Instead of one large kitchen, there will be three small kitchens that will only serve 32 residents at a time.", "The new facility, which will start to be torn down momentarily, is being increased from 90 beds to 192 beds, and that’s on Station Street. Quite frankly, it makes sense. If you’re trying to serve that many people at once, how are you going to get all the food out hot, fresh etc.? With smaller kitchens, they get faster service, hot food, more nutrition and less stumbling. It’s just a much more convenient, warm, friendly place to be.", "Another group was in, talking to us this past week, from Orchard Villa in Pickering. They’re on Valley Farm Road. They want to move from 169 to 224 new facility units in their new complex. I understand that application is in and it should be coming forward.", "Also, when I think of Whitby, as well, I remember the—the member would certainly remember the terrible fire, but it was all rebuilt. It’s beautiful; it’s new. When I was as young as 10 years old, there was a little shack there, and I used to visit one of my grandmothers and I used to visit one of my great-aunts. That appeased my mother, who couldn’t go all the time as she was caring for 10 children.", "I want to just mention that we’ve always been very clear that support for long-term care is important. That’s why we continue to make critical investments. In the long-term-care homes, that has increased by $348 million since 2013. Our investment in long-term-care homes increased by $80 million this year alone, representing an increase of some 2%.", "I think I’m getting close, Mr. Minister—maybe another minute.", "We’ve announced we will be opening 5,000 new long-term-care beds over four years. This is part of our 10-year plan to create more than 30,000 new beds over the next decade working with the long-term-care sector. Despite these achievements, we recognize the new challenges, especially Ontario’s aging population, are putting additional pressure on existing facilities. We’re creating so many new additions. You can see the improvement coming on an ongoing basis.", "We lost our mental health unit to another hospital area, and that was Rouge Valley. After several years, when a number of us got involved, it came back to Lakeridge, particularly Ajax-Pickering, where it was 10 years ago. We have the operational funding of $4.6 million through; we have new beds coming through.", "I can go on all the way, but I would sooner just sit down and listen to another talented—or perhaps the most talented speaker we will have the opportunity of still hearing today, the last speaker of the day, the Minister of Agriculture from Peterborough.", "Thank you, Speaker." ],

Now, his position is interesting, because just recently, the vice-president of the United States, one Al Gore, was here in Toronto. He has looked at all the numbers, he has looked at all the statistics, and he said that the province of Ontario is one of the leaders in climate change.", "If the member from Toronto–Danforth wants to get into a debate, I recommend that he give Vice-President Gore a call. We’ll bring him back to Toronto, and the member from Toronto–Danforth and Vice-President Gore could have a little chat. He was quite clear, when he was here in Toronto, about what a great job and what an innovative program our cap-and-trade with California and Quebec is, in terms of combatting climate change. Well, we’ll let the vice president have the last word on that.", "Madam Speaker, I had 18 years in municipal politics in Peterborough—from 1985 until the fall of 2003. For 10 of those years, I sat on a hospital board in Peterborough, the St. Joseph’s Hospital board, and for five of those years, I chaired the finance committee. So I have a great relationship with the medical profession in the riding of Peterborough.", "The chief executive officer of the Peterborough Regional Health Centre, one Dr. Peter McLaughlin—who is one of the leading cardiac surgeons in the province of Ontario—tells me that part of the challenge this year was the flu season. He said quite clearly to me that if everybody in Ontario had gotten their flu shot—we give it free, whether you go to a pharmacist, a nurse practitioner, a general practitioner, your family doctor or your next-door neighbour the surgeon. Everybody should get a flu shot in the province of Ontario, because Dr. McLaughlin told me that is the best preventive measure to keep people out of the ER in hospitals in Ontario. Madam Speaker, I just wanted to emphasize that.", "The other thing I knew and that I went through—when I was a municipal councillor, I had the wonderful experience of going through the NDP government from 1990 to 1995 and then the wonderful experience of the eight years of Mr. Harris and Mr. Eves.", "Let me tell you about that. They had a very innovative committee called the Who Does What committee. The Who Does What committee, of course, travelled around the province of Ontario. All of us who were in municipal politics caught on to that gig pretty early. It became the “who got done in” committee.", "Madam Speaker, you could answer that question: Who got done in? Municipalities of the province.", "Let me tell you about the game that they played. I got this information from their budget documents. Oh, Madam Speaker, they were clever, very clever indeed. They took the budget documents from the NDP government from 1990 to 1995. Of course, the NDP government had to grapple with a large budgetary deficit, but where did that deficit come from? It came because there was a significant downturn in the economy between 1990 and 1995, and welfare costs ballooned in the province of Ontario. So you look at their budget lines—it’s all in the library, Madam Speaker. Take a look at it. The numbers are there. So it went up; they had a deficit because of the social services costs of the province of Ontario.", "But Mike Harris—oh, he was clever indeed. He said, “I’m going to try to control deficits in Ontario, because I’ll take those costs that always balloon in a downturn.” And who did he give them to? He gave them to municipalities in the province of Ontario. It was a neat move.", "I remember being at AMO in Ottawa. I’m in the room. The Premier was there. I’ve always been very respectful of any Premier of the province of Ontario. The assembled folks there gave him three standing ovations. So I’m at the back of the room, standing with my then chief administrative officer of the city of Peterborough, Brian Horton. He’s since retired. He’s a great guy; I know the family well. I said to Brian, “Brian, my south-end Peterborough elementary math tells me that this is not going to be revenue-neutral.” Brian Horton, who is a CA and a very qualified individual, turned to me and said, “Jeff, you’re exactly right. We know where the cost drivers are in the municipality. This is just going to be an offload, a download, so that municipalities will have to worry about any of those costs going forward.”", "Let me tell you another story, about the 407. It’s the one I really like. Again, this is from their budget documents. I got all the stuff from the library. They were getting ready for the 1999 provincial election. They were short. Harris promised a balanced budget, and they got a plug number in their budget of about $3 billion. Madam Speaker, you’ve been to Walmart; you know the Walmart man. He starts with the price high and keeps lowering and lowering and lowering. There was a price put on the 407, and like Walmart—it started at $9 billion: “No, we roll it back to $8 billion.” “No, we roll it back to $7 billion.” “No, we roll it back to $6 billion.” “No, we roll it back to $5 billion.” “No, we roll it back to $4 billion.” Because they only needed $3 billion, they sold off an asset at $3 billion that was worth $9 billion. So anybody who drives on the 407 can see that today—those gouging tolls on that section from Brock Road in Pickering through to Burlington. But the other section where the tolls are 30% less is a section that we have built from Brock Road in Pickering through Taunton Road/418 in Clarington. It’s interesting; that party there, when they were in power, promised the extension of the 407. They didn’t pay for one inch of the 407 beyond Brock Road in Pickering. The municipal leadership in Durham was asking for it for years. So this government delivered on that.", "Madam Speaker, let me tell you about health care in the riding of Peterborough. We’ve built a brand new, state-of-the-art hospital in Peterborough under this government’s watch. We’re now building a modern 10-bed hospice under this government’s watch. I had the opportunity just recently, with the former Minister of Health and Long-Term Care, Eric Hoskins, to announce a brand new, 125-bed long-term-care home in the beautiful community of Havelock, Ontario, in the wonderful municipality of Havelock-Belmont-Methuen.", "My background is in economics. When you look at the BMO review that was done by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, the economic fundamentals have been the best in this province in two decades. The unemployment rate, 5.5%, is the lowest it has been in 17 years. In my hometown of Peterborough, the unemployment rate is 4.9%, well below the provincial average.", "Folks, they want to attack those statistics, and they may want to attack those underlying things.", "My daughter, Shanae, who I’m going to pick up tomorrow, is at Laurier University in Waterloo. I’ve been in Waterloo on numerous occasions. I talk to business leaders in Waterloo, and they tell me the economy is booming. In fact, when you’re in Kitchener, Waterloo, Guelph, Cambridge—the unemployment rate is now what most economists would call a full employment rate, 4% or less.", "Just this week, Randy Hope, the mayor of Chatham-Kent, who sat on those benches right over there, said things are booming in Chatham-Kent—a very distinguished former member of the NDP government, from 1990 to 1995.", "What’s really interesting here is, I look over there and I see doom and I see gloom, but by every stretch of the imagination—any objective economist who has looked at the fundamentals of Ontario—things are in solid shape. Is there more to do? There’s always more to do. The throne speech outlined some of this.", "We talk about deficits. Mr. Davis, who was a very distinguished Premier of the province of Ontario, I believe ran 14 straight deficits when he was Premier of the province of Ontario—and his very famous treasurer, a remarkable man, W. Darcy McKeough, was nicknamed the Duke of Kent because he represented the wonderful riding of Chatham–Kent. When you look at Steve Paikin’s book written about Mr. Davis during his time as Premier, Darcy McKeough used to say, “You make capital investments for a better tomorrow.”" ],

We’re here talking about the throne speech and what it means to the people of Ontario. It’s very interesting, because I speak to people in Peterborough and I hear plenty of doom and gloom. I also hear from many people in Peterborough because my dad had a house in Peterborough, so I’m up there quite a bit, fixing it up. When they hear that I’m involved in politics and a member of the PC caucus, quite a few people have said to me that they are cousins of the member opposite. He must have a large, enormous network of cousins, because in fact one of my father’s neighbours is a cousin. Obviously, his family goes way back in the region.", "So I’m listening to him talk about Peterborough and I’m picturing Peterborough and remembering all of his cousins. Then he mentions Waterloo, which is my alma mater. His daughter—I believe he said her name was Shanae—attends Wilfrid Laurier, which is across the street from the University of Waterloo, where I went. Our caucus just visited Waterloo. We visited the Institute for Quantum Computing. We saw the train tracks of the train that hasn’t been delivered yet. The tracks were built, and the train is nowhere to be seen.", "So there are certainly some problems in Waterloo. They are anxious to be able to interact with the other hubs of technology in the GTA.

Last week, during constituency week, I had the opportunity to go and open the very first carbon-neutral farm in Ontario, out there by Woodstock, a wonderful place: Harcolm Farms. The proprietor is Robert McKinley, a dairy farmer with about 120 cattle. That, you will know, means he has three computerized dairy milking machines, because each one does about 40 cows, right? All of the effluent from those cows—the stuff that we don’t want to talk too much about in the House, Speaker—it all gets collected. It gets scraped off the floor, put into pipes, and they put it into an anaerobic digester that drives two 10-kilowatt generators, one of which is the first bio-digesting FIT program in the province of Ontario. They get 25 cents a kilowatt hour to produce power from this substance, and the other 10 kilowatts are for on-farm use. It’s a fantastic operation, built by an engineer, a great guy named John Hawkes, who organized this whole thing.", "This comes from the proceeds of cap-and-trade.

Once again, it’s too little, too late. The government would like Ontario residents to believe that $11 million allocated over four years to hire more mental health workers on campuses will address the mental health crisis on campuses that has existed for several years, years that there has been a Liberal government. This works out to under $3 million per year, and when allocated across each of the 44 community colleges and universities, it won’t have the impact that students, faculty and administrators desperately need today to address mental health demands on their campuses.", "I’ve spoken with administrators, faculty and student groups across the province, and there’s absolutely unanimous agreement that the growing mental health needs of students are the most significant challenge on post-secondary campuses today.

They are tired of watered-down Auditor General oversight of government advertising so that they could spend $17 million on ads meant to make the Liberal Party look good. They’re tired of promising a balanced budget but delivering an $8-billion deficit. They’re tired of building a GO station in the Minister of Transportation’s riding despite government experts saying it shouldn’t be built.", "People in Dufferin–Caledon want an end to hallway medicine at Brampton Civic Hospital. They want an end to the multi-year wait-lists for long-term-care beds in Ontario. They want real and long-term relief on their hydro rates. They want a government that seeks to lower their taxes and respect the hard-earned tax dollars they collect.", "Unfortunately, the Liberals’ legislative reset will not accomplish any of this. Instead, it really means that all of the important legislation that my colleagues and I were bringing forward will have to begin again.", "That’s why I have reintroduced the End the Public Funding of Partisan Government Advertising Act, or Bill 7. In 2015, the Liberal government watered down the Auditor General’s oversight of government advertising so that the auditor did not have the ability to veto government ads that they felt were partisan and self-congratulatory. Since that time, the Liberals have taken advantage of this loophole and spent millions of taxpayers’ dollars on advertising that would not have been approved under the old rules. In fact, in 2017, the Liberals spent over $17 million on advertising which the Auditor General said “had as their primary goal to foster a positive impression of the government party.” That’s a quote for “partisan.”", "As an example, the government spent nearly $3 million on an ad campaign to promote the government’s planned investments in infrastructure. The auditor said that this campaign was “self-congratulatory and aimed at ensuring that the government gets credit for its potential future spending plans.” The problem with this is that tax dollars should not be used for the benefit of the Liberal Party. Secondly, spending this money on partisan ads takes away money from ads that could actually assist Ontarians. These self-congratulatory ads do not help people access service or require any action. They simply are meant to make the government look good. That’s why the PC caucus and I have been calling on the government to stop these ads and instead use that money to raise awareness about human trafficking or the fentanyl crisis.", "Yesterday, I also reintroduced the Sewage Bypass Reporting Act. This proposed legislation would require the Minister of the Environment to publicly report when and where a sewage bypass occurs. Sewage bypasses occur when a treatment plant is forced to discharge partially treated or untreated sewage into local waterways to prevent flooding or basement flooding. The ministry already receives the information from the municipalities, but so far has refused to make this information public. Publicizing this information is important for two reasons. One, it will help Ontarians know when there is partially treated or raw effluent being discharged into the waterways they swim, sail and canoe in; secondly, it will ensure that Ontarians can better understand the importance of investing in our sewer, waste water and storm water infrastructure.", "Finally, I intend to reintroduce—because of the prorogation, I must reintroduce—my proposed legislation entitled the Aggregate Recycling Promotion Act. I had introduced a previous version of the Aggregate Recycling Promotion Act in 2013. While it did not become law, the government did incorporate some of the principles into the Infrastructure for Jobs and Prosperity Act, which now reads, “Infrastructure planning and investment should endeavour to make use of acceptable recycled aggregates.”", "However, despite this wording in the legislation, there are still municipalities and government organizations which refuse to even consider using recycled aggregates when they could in their public projects. The Environmental Commissioner, in the 2017 report, criticized Metrolinx for its lack of using recycled aggregates and even called the agency a “laggard” in recycled aggregate.", "I get the sense I’m going to have to wrap up, but allow me to say that this proposed legislation is crucial because the Ontario government is the largest user of aggregates." ],

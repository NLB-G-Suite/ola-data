  "text" : [ "Good morning, Speaker. Thank you very much. I’m pleased to be able to rise today to speak on the debate of Bill 122, which will amend the Mental Health Act and the Health Care Consent Act. It has been almost a year—December 23, 2014—since the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled that some existing provisions of the Mental Health Act violate section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which states, “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.”", "The Mental Health Act, as it currently stands, does not do the job of protecting these section 7 rights of approximately 330 long-term, involuntarily committed mental health patients in Ontario. That is, those people who were put in psychiatric institutions for six months or longer and who did not commit themselves to be there.", "According to statistics from 2009-10, approximately 34% of patients involuntarily committed in Ontario were in hospital for less than a week, 80% were in hospital for less than a month and 98% were in hospital for less than six months. That leaves 2% of patients who were involuntarily committed for longer than six months. These are the 330 people that the amendment, this Bill 122, pertains to.", "The decision by the Court of Appeal was unanimously ruled by five justices. They recognized that a gap in the existing Mental Health Act means that people can be detained indefinitely even though the Consent and Capacity Board does not have full powers to rule on the treatment, or the lack of it, that a patient is receiving. These long-term patients, therefore, are being deprived of their right to liberty without procedures in place that protect fundamental justice.", "The effect of the ruling is to limit the length of involuntary committals to approximately six months. The court recognized the need to balance public safety concerns with the need to properly protect the rights of patients, so they suspended the ruling for 12 months to afford the Legislature, where we are today, the opportunity to consider how best to deal with the issues of long-term involuntary committals and the power of the Consent and Capacity Board. That is why we have Bill 122 before us today.", "But we have a major problem here, because the 12 months is almost upon us and we have yet to be concerned about our ability to give such an important matter the consideration it deserves in the time we have available. The government opposite has known for 10 and a half months that this needed to be done, and yet here we are doing it now, almost to the day. It took them nine months from the court ruling before they introduced this bill. Whatever would have prolonged the thought of making sure we were getting this bill forward quicker is beyond me; I don’t understand the logistics behind the government. But I will go on. Now we’re racing against the clock to get it done.", "Mental health is very complex. It has a history of failing to respect the rights of patients. Yes, times have changed a lot in the past 30 or 40 years. We don’t hear the same language we heard back then; we see greater levels of empathy and understanding. But we still have a long, long way to go to treat mental illness the same way we treat other illnesses. Many people have worked very hard over the years to reduce the stigma, but it’s still there. So we need to make sure that we listen, not just to the legal experts, but also to the advocacy groups and the individuals and families with their experience in mental health. The timeline that the government has imposed on us with this bill makes it very hard to do.", "On Monday evening, Speaker, I attended a fundraiser for the Good Shepherd in our hometown of Hamilton. It’s a wonderful organization that works to serve a wide variety of clients—women needing shelter from abuse, which is the fundraiser I was there for. It was a wonderful reception and fundraiser for Mary’s Place, Speaker, which is a women’s shelter in our hometown. They do emergency food, clothing programs and assisted living for seniors, just to name a few.", "As the NDP critic for children and youth services, I have a particular interest in their youth service programs, where they’re committed to helping youth who are struggling with poverty, family conflict, homelessness, abuse, neglect and mental health issues. They do absolutely fantastic, terrific work. A year or so ago, I spent an entire week travelling through all of the children’s services they provide in Hamilton.", "Just to give you a flavour of how difficult their job is, in a city the size of Hamilton they have funding for 1.6 mental health clinicians to serve all the youth in greater Hamilton. For any youth within any programming in Hamilton who needs mental health services, there are only 1.6 clinicians to do all of that work. It’s pretty much impossible. Without adequate funding, too many kids descend into a darker place. When the opportunity for early intervention is missed, they can become dangerous to themselves and dangerous to others.", "I was told at this dinner on Monday night about the sad passing of two youths in the last two weeks, both from crystal meth. Both had been in programs within the Good Shepherd and both had mental health illness. Because of the lack of funding and because of the lack of early intervention, these children found themselves, first of all, addicted to crystal meth, which is everything under the kitchen sink, to death. So I think we need to do better.", "According to the Ministry of Health, approximately 30% of Ontarians will experience a mental health or substance abuse challenge during their lifetime; one out of 40 people will face a serious mental health illness. The rights of all Ontarians must be protected, and unfortunately those with a serious mental illness will run the risk of their rights being violated. In 2009, the Ontario Human Rights Commission had this to say in relation to the Ministry of Health discussion paper on a 10-year mental health and addiction strategy:", "“The rights of people living with mental illness to: health; dignity; bodily integrity and security of the person, and equal treatment in employment, services (including health care), and housing are all fundamental human rights. Acknowledging these is integral to the redevelopment of the mental health system and can inform a culture shift towards equality for people with mental illnesses and addictions.”", "In It Doesn’t Work: Unpacking Mental Health Policy and Legislation, the Schizophrenia Society of Ontario said, “The Charter of Rights and Freedoms is the supreme law in Canada and all other federal and provincial statutes related to the provision of care to people with mental illnesses in Ontario ... must conform to the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the charter.”", "Then they went on to say, “Provincial mental health legislation, therefore, must comply with the charter through a balance of the autonomy and liberty of the individual with the safety and security of the public.” So not only was the government faced with a court ruling almost a year ago, but they had plenty of advance warning before that time that changes needed to be made to the Mental Health Act to ensure compliance with the Charter of Rights. But again, they still left it until the last minute.", "So I welcome the Court of Appeal ruling, and now it’s our job to make sure that the charter rights of patients are respected and their voices are heard. We need to help protect the safety of patients and the public. We need to listen to the countless families, organizations, experts and individuals who have important insights to the broader change that needs to be made to our mental health legislation.", "My colleague the member from Nickel Belt, in her one-hour lead on this debate, read a letter from Arthur Gallant, who had been asked to become a member of the Mental Health and Addictions Leadership Advisory Council. At the age of just 25, Mr. Gallant had extensive experience with mental health. His mother suffered from a long-term mental illness and he himself was diagnosed with a mental illness at the age of 13. Ever since then, he has become a mental health advocate. He is a remarkable young man, and it is clear from his eloquent words that he deserved his place on that council, along with the other health executives that occupied the other seats around the table. I should mention that there was one other person on the council with lived experience, so that makes two people with lived experience on the council of 20.", "Sadly, as expected, Mr. Gallant’s experience, as recounted in his letter, suggests the exact opposite of what we need to see when it comes to patient involvement. He spoke of being shut out from the very start; nobody asked for his advice. When he did speak out, he was interrupted and shut down. He tried to get more involved, but he got nowhere. When he asked for explanations, none were given. His emails were ignored. That’s how this government does consultation: ignore the people that it affects the most. That, Speaker, is not the way that we should be moving forward. We need to listen. We need to listen to people whose lives are affected.", "So what, in fact, does this bill do? Under the proposed amendments, the Consent and Capacity Board will gain new powers to make orders concerning the manner of detention for involuntary patients, particularly those who have been in hospital for more than six months. Currently, the CCB, which is the Consent and Capacity Board, only has the authority to rule that an involuntary detention is valid or invalid, or in order to transfer to a different psychiatric facility. They cannot make any order concerning the treatment that that patient receives and the manner in which they are detained. They have no authority to impose conditions on the patient’s detention and treatment. It is this lack of authority that violates the rights of these patients to procedural fairness.", "This was the central point of the court case that led to the ruling. The individual, P.S., in P.S. v. Ontario, has been held in indefinite detention, without any mechanisms to ensure he gets the treatment and services he needs in the appropriate type of facility.", "The amendments would allow the Consent and Capacity Board to transfer patients to another facility if the patient does not object. They would be allowed to place the patient on leave of absence from the hospital on the advice of a physician, including prescribed terms and conditions.", "They will be able to direct that the patient be provided with a different security level or different privileges, either inside or outside the facility. They will be able to direct access to the community and determine whether that should be supervised or unsupervised access.", "The amendments will also allow the Consent and Capacity Board to direct that the patient be given vocational, interpretation or rehabilitation services, and they will be able to order an independent assessment of the patient.", "It looks like the Consent and Capacity Board will be very busy, but that’s not a bad thing. It’s a good thing that they will have this new authority that brings the Mental Health Act in line with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.", "But it does bring with it the costs associated with exercising this new authority, and that does not appear to be reflected in the government’s plans. At the same time as the government plans to expand the authority of the Consent and Capacity Board, it is also reducing the funding. Go figure, Speaker. It seems to happen often. Pay more, get less. Interim actual reports for 2014-15 show expenditures for the CCB of $6.2 million, but for 2015-16, funding is reportedly being cut to $4.8 million.", "We have been talking about mental health in this House since I’ve been here, and I know it’s been long back—we’ve had select committees on mental health. We’re doing it all. We’re doing a great job of talking about it. But we’re—they’re cutting funding. I’m not even going to say “we’re.” They’re cutting funding, again, to the most important aspects of our society. If we can’t get mental health right, what in this society are we going to get right? Because everything is just going to snowball around it.", "Work more, and less money to do it with—that is a big concern, and I worry about what it means for mental health patients.", "Speaker, the clock’s ticking. That’s good. I’m close; I’m almost done. Twenty minutes goes pretty quick here in this House sometimes.", "As I understand it, if we fail to meet the December deadline, the offending sections of the act will become unconstitutional and invalid. We have until December 23 to get this bill through. It’s now November 4. The House rises on December 10, and next week the House is not sitting, as we have a constituency week. The time is ticking quicker than the government is allotting for, I think.", "We’re going to have to again push legislation through this House, with no concerns of getting it right or wrong. It doesn’t really matter. Let’s just shove it through, and the people of Ontario will suffer from it. That’s what happens." ],

They’ve had plenty of time to prepare for this, but they have badly mismanaged this file.", "As a result, we find ourselves in this situation of again pushing legislation through this House as fast as we can get it. Bill after bill comes through this House. It’s jammed through. It’s time-allocated. People are shut down. There is no discussion. There is no community involvement. We don’t even want to hear from the community, because community members who actually make it onto the board—and who are excited that they’re going to be there and possibly make a change—are shut down. Nobody speaks to them. Nobody answers their emails. They speak over them when they ask questions. They don’t want the involvement. They’re tokens, a token population.", "We see this time and time again with this government. They’re selling off their hydro system. Public consultation? Absolutely not. Any polls that you do, 80%-plus of Ontarians are totally against it, but what does this government do? Push, push, push and ram it through as fast as they can. Ram it through, just like everything else.", "Again, this important piece of legislation, Bill 122, that has been asked for, that we knew a year back had to be done—at the last minute, here comes the Liberal government, running through, seeing how fast we can push another piece of legislation through, with no public consultation, without making sure we get it right, without the dollars to back up the plan.", "Let’s talk about those numbers again, Speaker. How much is being cut? Just for the member opposite, because he looks a little concerned over there: In 2014-15, there was $6.2 million in the CCB. Now that we’ve given them so much more work, guess how much we have now? It’s $4.8 million. More work, less money." ],

Each one of us, as a representative in our constituencies, has received calls from distraught parents and family members who have people within the family who are suffering from mental illness. I must say, something positive is that we’re now recognizing and talking about mental illness more and more in a very public way, because for years it got pushed to the back burner. Advocates were reluctant to talk about it. But all of us have had people come to us just distraught over what to do about a patient who is suffering from mental illness.", "The court has ruled, and governments have to adjust to the courts. In this particular case, they gave the government of Ontario a year, up until the date mentioned in December, to pass legislation which would deal with the concerns the court had expressed. Therefore, we are in a position of having to do that. I won’t say this is relatively simple. It is not overly complex, but it does address specifically what the courts have told us. It may not be what many of us in the House would agree with—we don’t always agree with the decisions of the court—but in this case, we must comply with it.", "The minister, I know, and the Ministry of Health have wrestled with this problem for some time, trying to find the appropriate balance between the rights of the patients and the concerns that society has, including members of family, over the appropriate treatment of mental health patients." ],

She always speaks with passion representing her community, and she spoke for 20 minutes this morning on this issue that’s obviously having an impact in the Hamilton area, as it is in Prince Edward–Hastings. There just simply aren’t enough people on the ground to deal with the mental health cases that are piling up.", "We talk about our police officers. Our police officers are dealing so often with mental health cases because there are not enough mental health workers out there.", "We have a great advocate in our community, Sandie Sidsworth of the Canadian Mental Health Association for Hastings and Prince Edward. She’s the executive director. She’s done a magnificent job over the last couple of years of really bringing these issues to light. But what the government hasn’t been able to do is provide the funding increases so that we can provide those counsellors on the ground to help deal with these situations as they arise. Police officers shouldn’t be doing it; it should be trained counsellors dealing with these issues. Unfortunately, so many of our police officers out there are tied up with these mental health cases when it should be a trained professional. So I commend the people who are on the ground who are doing the work, but this is a direct result of a government that either can’t, is in capable or won’t manage its own fiscal house.", "The Auditor General warned us several times that when you don’t get your own fiscal house in order—speaking to this government—it starts to crowd out the services that you should be providing in your community; it limits the ability for governments to provide the types of services that need to be provided. We all know in this House that mental health is the biggest issue facing our health care system in Ontario because we’re not treating it properly. And part of the reason that we’re not is because we don’t have our financial house in order; we can’t provide the funding and the resources that are necessary to keep our most vulnerable people healthy. That’s what it comes down to, in my opinion.", "I congratulate, again, the member from Hamilton Mountain on her speech this morning." ],

I understand the member for St. Catharines—I agree; it’s a very complicated, delicate matter. But there is a disappointment in the fact that this government has kind of—it feels like it’s being pushed.", "I checked with the Clerk, because I wanted to make sure of the process, that there was no little order in our standing orders that we must go to committee, or can it be overridden? Definitely. When we have a debate, you have your introduction of the bill. Then we have second reading and there is a debate, which we’re in right now. Then, usually, when second reading is over with—members can debate the bill as long as they wish, unless the government time-allocates it, and I speculate that this will probably be time-allocated—at that point, we usually vote for it to go to committee. But there is no requirement in the standing orders that any bill has to go to committee for people to present deputations and comments and make amendments. If that doesn’t happen, if we don’t send it to committee, the government can call it for third reading right away. It doesn’t have to have debate on third reading either; it can just be agreed upon for royal assent.", "So in the timing, this might be the plan the government has, because it is December 23 that the court decision has said that we have to make new legislation in order to accommodate the human rights factor in this issue.", "That’s just my question and speculation on the debate on this bill." ],

As a former social worker, I would say that mental health, as acknowledged by some of our colleagues here, is one of the most complex and difficult issues that our youth, adults and also seniors are facing.", "It’s interesting when I hear the members saying that we do not consult. In this particular instance, because of the complexity of everything we had to do, we needed to consult with our stakeholders. My colleague here made reference to the fact that this is not an issue where you just make a decision. So, yes, there was a court ruling, and we had to look as a government and reach out to the people who are most affected, the people who are actually experiencing this issue, and see how we can best follow through the court system, but also protect the family members and give the right to our society to feel protected.", "We also hear about the fact that we haven’t invested in mental health. Well, I have to say, I am proud to say that, since 2003, our mental health and addiction funding has increased by over $506 million, for a total of $1 billion. Now our phase 2 is approaching." ],

This is the group of people that we are dealing with here. The issue which has been contentious for many, many years and many, many decades, in fact, probably: How do you balance the right of the patient to have some control over their own treatment and the rights of the community to be safe?", "Quite frankly, what those of us who have been working in constituency offices for many years, and those of us who served on the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions, of which I am one—which is the legitimate concern of families that, in many cases, psychosis is so severe that getting treatment would actually assist the patient in getting to a place where they cease to be a threat to themselves. The conundrum is that the patient’s wishes, absent treatment, may actually turn out to be different from the patient’s wishes if only they could access treatment. So there’s even a conundrum there about how you best determine the well-being of the patient. This is a very, very complicated area.", "The court has found that the current provisions of the Mental Health Act do not sufficiently respect the right of the patient to intervene and request that they be able to cease being involuntarily detained.

Quite frankly, Speaker, that’s problematic, because we know that many of those patients who have been held for more than six months are a real threat to others in the community. Because of their psychosis, they may respond in extreme and violent ways. So we need to come to some solution.", "Now, unlike what the member opposite has suggested, which is that there is some affront to the Legislature in bringing the bill at this point, what has actually been going on has been a very robust consultation with the various organizations that are involved in the discussion.

We have invested over $11 million to place 144 mental health nurses in schools. More than 770 mental health workers are serving communities, schools and courts, and more than 1,000 additional psychiatric consultations are being held with children with mental health challenges each year through the Tele-Mental Health Service, because there are so many communities where there just simply aren’t child psychologists.

On the one hand, you have the advocates for patients themselves who say they have their rights, and on the other hand you have the family members, close friends, very often members of police services and others who say that you simply have to have laws which allow us to take more interventionist action to be able to assist these people. Many people come to our office and say, “Ultimately, I can tell you that my son”—or daughter—“will be dead within two or three years.” What you hate to see is when that prediction comes true.", "As I say, if I were constructing this—and I can tell you, there were many different points of view that were presented while this was being discussed within cabinet committees, because of that frustration that people have had over the years in dealing with these problems.", "This bill will address a court ruling.

I know some of my colleagues will go into more detail.", "I spent about 12 years of my life working on the streets. I started work around 9 o’clock at night, and I would finish around 3 or 4 in the morning. My son whom I fostered and adopted was one of these street-involved kids. The way a lot of young people are dealt with in mental health situations is that they’re left, really, to nothing.", "This was in another province. This was in Winnipeg, in a province that’s not as wealthy as Ontario and doesn’t have the mental health services or capacity that we have. We often talk in Ontario about how we have, somehow, inadequate services, and in some cases you can almost never really have enough services, given the complexity of the challenges we’re facing. But in other parts of Canada that don’t have the industrial, banking or mining base or wealth that Ontario has, those services sometimes are scarce and, quite frankly, often paid for by Ontarians and others in transfer payments.", "I was always amazed: The kids I worked with had schizophrenia, were bipolar; they were, like my son, fetal alcohol syndrome, which means that you’re born, basically, as chemically dependent into this world, which is one of the cruellest things to see done to a child. I always admire him. He now has his own company, seven employees. He is married, which is something we never thought. It was a huge amount of intervention, but it was at the very core of this, because for my relationship with Michael, it was always his civil liberties.", "He was HIV-positive and could be very aggressive because his mental illness would sometimes lead him to be violent—and parenting and getting the supports. I always said that if he was institutionalized he had all the mental health supports, but if he was with me in a family where dad would show up at high school, coach his hockey team and do all the things that he needed that I did for him—it was very hard to do that and do the mental health piece because you didn’t get mental health support.", "So we started a group with seven friends of mine; we called it the “extreme parenting group.” We all had children whom we were fostering or adopted who had fetal alcohol syndrome, who were bipolar or who had schizophrenia. Some of them had developed autism and some of them had constructs around genetic issues that were hard to deal with.", "It was amazing to me, the number of children who end up solving their pain by illegally using prescription drugs or getting heroin. My son would shoot up, as much as 30 times a day, Talwin and Ritalin, which is a speedball. We have a vast amount of legal and illegal drugs out there that kids use to self-medicate their pain.", "The other thing that they do is that they tend to be involved in prostitution and they tend to be involved in robbing themselves. They tend not to hurt other people; they commit crimes against themselves which are disruptive to their sense of self-esteem.", "I agree with some of the other members and the member from St. Catharines in that this is a difficult issue. In my case, I remember coming home in February; it was 40 below and Michael had broken every window in my home. That cost me about $17,000. He stole the television, stole my car, stole the VCR and stole the stamp collection. I always say to parents, “If you want to parent kids like that, your personal items cannot be more valuable to you than your children.” I have no regrets about that. I lost all of those things.", "That’s a high level. So how do we take care of these kids? It can’t be just about mental health services. Every child should have the right to a parent who loves them. I learned not to be a very materialistic person because nothing in my life, living with Michael, allowed me to keep anything material. Many of my friends and many of the other kids whom I fostered for shorter periods of time had that serious thing. We often talk about, “It takes a village to raise a child,” that it takes us collectively. We live in a very materialistic society, where sometimes we’re not prepared to make the sacrifices we need to. It’s hard. No one ever thought Michael would make it to 18. I wish he wasn’t representative.", "We often hear in this society that we’re taught to be afraid of strangers. The people who abused Michael were previous parents of his who broke his leg, who gave him alcohol at age six, who drank before birth and left Michael with all kinds of disabilities that injured him. When he was sexually and physically assaulted, as were most of the kids, it was done by their parents or people they knew.", "A lot of the politics is somehow, “People who abuse children are horrible strangers whom we need to protect people from.” It’s usually the people whom they’re most vulnerable to, because it’s an uncle, it’s a hockey coach or it’s a parent—that’s 80% or 90%. Almost all the kids whom I saw on the street were abused by someone who was in a position of care to protect them. That’s what often triggered a lot of the mental health issues or compounded mental health issues that were in place.", "I’ve just exceeded my time a bit, and I want to leave some time for the member for Halton.

It’s about respecting a person’s rights and freedoms and balancing that with their family’s concerns for their own safety. And as government, we have to be sure that we are concerned about the safety of society at large.", "The provincial Mental Health Act provides for the involuntary detention of patients in psychiatric facilities where patients present a risk of harm to themselves or others. Let me give you a little bit of context, Mr. Speaker, about what we’re talking about here. Mental health is a complex and important issue in Ontario’s health care system.

Think about it. Those numbers are staggering.", "The Canadian Mental Health Association estimates that 10% to 20% of Canadian youth are affected by mental illness. That’s why our government has created a comprehensive mental health and addictions strategy, to make sure that we’re addressing care on all levels and making sure that we’re doing the right thing when it comes to these families and individuals facing challenges in their lives.", "The Court of Appeal addressed the involuntary admission and detention of patients under the Mental Health Act, and the court said that part of the act was inconsistent with section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court of Appeal gave us until December 22 of this year to make these amendments to the Mental Health Act and make sure that we comply with the court’s decision. That date is crucial. We need to get these things in place and we need to make sure that these individuals in society are protected. That’s why we’re moving as efficiently as we can to get the job done. It is about doing the right thing when it comes to the people of this province.", "Specifically, the court struck down the provision of the act that allows a person to be detained in a psychiatric facility for longer than six months. For example, what this does is it ensures that, from the Court of Appeal, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, in partnership with the Ministry of the Attorney General, has reviewed the act and consulted with stakeholders on some of these proposed amendments. These proposed amendments, if passed, ensure that the Mental Health Act aligns with the Canadian Charter of Rights and at the same time enhances the rights of involuntary, long-term patients who have been committed to psychiatric facilities.", "The amendments that are being debated today would enhance the ability of the Consent and Capacity Board to make certain guidelines for patients who have been in a psychiatric facility as an involuntary patient for longer than six months. What this does is it makes sure the board takes into account, for example:", "—the safety of the public;", "—the ability of the psychiatric facility to manage and provide care;", "—the mental condition of the patient;", "—the reintegration of that patient into society; and", "—other needs of the patient.", "Also, it takes into account limitations that we will be placing—and could be placing—on a patient’s freedoms.", "These are tough decisions. Too many Ontarians are touched by mental health each year. The objectives of the Mental Health Act are ensuring community safety and helping patients, making sure that they get the help they need. Our government is committed to making the most appropriate care for those who need it most within the system.", "I support these amendments.

Every time the government came forward with a new suggestion, that had to be canvassed with a variety of people as well to get their reaction. It did take a while to go through cabinet committees, longer than many items might. So that was the reason. There was not general agreement.

Wes for Youth is an example of a community caring for their young people.

Mr. Speaker, the judge ordered a deadline of December 23, and, given the parliamentary calendar, we have just nine weeks to debate this legislation—four weeks if you only consider what little time we have left. That’s hardly enough time to conduct consultations with the relevant stakeholders or consider all of the implications that these amendments might have. This government truly has to get back on track with their consultations.", "I have said numerous times that this government has a bad habit of excluding relevant stakeholders from sitting at the consultation table. They have done it time and time again.

They have every right to be upset. They bring serious issues to the table that this government should not and cannot ignore.", "The changes fail to address the current limitations of the CCB as an expert tribunal on mental health by not allowing treatment to begin once the CCB has rendered a decision. The CCB is a panel of medical professionals, lawyers and public members who are experienced “in interpreting and applying legislation with specific knowledge of the Mental Health Act, Health Care Consent Act, 1996, Substitute Decisions Act, Personal Health Information Protection Act, Mandatory Blood Testing Act and Statutory Powers Procedure Act.”", "By failing to consider the concerns of these psychiatrists and specialists who are involved with mental health patients on the ground, this government has told them that the professional opinion they’ve been hired to render and the opinion of the CCB are worthless and that they know better; the government knows better. This is unacceptable. Again, we have to bring the right people to the table, we have to let the experts lead by their experience and we have to work with them, not exclude them.", "In fact, the very recommendation that I just spoke about was brought forth when the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions held deputations in April 2010. I believe there were a number of recommendations brought forth between 2009 and 2010 when the committee met, but we are just getting to this now with four weeks to go, when we’re responsible for ensuring that 339 patients continue to receive the care that their medical professionals deem necessary.", "We talked about having a year since the judge ordered this amendment, but the truth is that this government had five—almost six—years to work out the details and engage advocacy groups on the matter. Yet they chose instead to do it in the eleventh hour, when they could claim that they had no time to talk to anyone about it, and that’s just not acceptable. While they’ve been dragging their feet, Ontarians continue to struggle to get the help they need.

Last year, Ontario firefighters responded to nearly 3,700 calls involving carbon monoxide, most of them in homes or apartments.

That is why I’m proud to mark the second annual Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week in our province’s history.", "We already know that having a working smoke alarm increases the chances of surviving a fire in your residence by up to 50%. Like smoke alarms, installing a carbon monoxide alarm is one of those small, simple actions that can have a huge impact. These alarms are easy to install, easy to use, are affordable and, most importantly, can save lives. I encourage every Ontarian to install a carbon monoxide alarm today.", "If you already have one, make sure it is working and test it whenever you test your smoke alarm. Speak to your family, friends and neighbours and reinforce this very important message. If they need help, ask if you could test their alarms for them. We need to take this week and every single day as an opportunity to spread the word about the dangers of carbon monoxide and the necessity of a detector in our homes. It could truly save the life of someone you love." ],

It empowers individuals to build greater security. We live in a time of economic challenges. We also live in a time of overwhelming choice. With so many financial options available, the need for this education is growing.", "We know that personal finances can sometimes seem intimidating and high-stakes. Numerous reports show that money is the number-one source of stress in North America. Ontarians deserve the comfort of knowledge to make good decisions.", "Improving financial literacy in the province enables us to positively impact our shared future as we build Ontario up. A better understanding of financial basics is good for economic growth. It means increasing our investments. It means increasing consumer participation responsibly. It means increasing retirement security.", "Financially-literate Ontarians understand how best to balance their personal spending choices with appropriate savings for the future. Informed choices lead to better choices. Financially-literate Ontarians are better positioned to make stronger investments. Financially-literate consumers protect themselves by asking the right questions. We want Ontarians to be equipped to avoid exploitation. It’s their money; we want them to have more of it and make more of it.", "Financial literacy enables students to make the right choices to further their education without compromising their future with excessive obligations. Financial literacy also enables families to make the most of their time together. And it gives our young people a better platform for success. That’s why strong financial management skills start in the home.", "In Ontario, learning financial basics is supplemented at school. I was pleased in September 2009 to table and pass a motion in this House that undertook that the Ministry of Education include financial literacy in our elementary and secondary school curriculum.", "Financial literacy also enables people to understand the need to save for retirement early in their working career. They understand the importance of saving now to finance their post-retirement lifestyle. They know better what they need today and how they get there for tomorrow.", "Finally, financial literacy plays an important role in reducing poverty. During the implementation of payday loans legislation in 2008, it was evident that there were high levels of rollovers at excessive costs, affecting those most vulnerable. Enhancing financial awareness can only help, especially those struggling with their personal finances, a fact we have heard in poverty reduction round tables.", "Better knowledge of financial basics can go a long way toward helping people improve their circumstances. Reducing the number of people in financial difficulty reduces demands on our social services. With greater understanding of the resources available to them, Ontarians can take a more active role in protecting their futures.", "This is not a one-time lesson. Financial literacy education must be ongoing. This month, the Ministry of Finance and partner ministries will celebrate financial literacy by providing more tips. Our hope is to enhance Ontarians’ understanding by sharing more information to improve financial awareness. This is only the beginning. Our priority is to help Ontarians increase their overall financial literacy and enable long-term benefits for all.", "Mr. Speaker, I invite our colleagues to partner across our government to further financial literacy initiatives and celebrate Financial Literacy Month." ],

You can also help stop carbon monoxide from getting into your home by making sure your vents and chimneys aren’t blocked, having a fuel-burning appliance serviced regularly, and not using outdoor appliances such as barbecues inside.", "This week, fire departments across Ontario are delivering these messages through events, public service announcements and going door to door. I want to commend them for their efforts and work every day to raise awareness, provide education and save lives.", "I also want to commend John Gignac, founder of the Hawkins-Gignac Foundation, and the Insurance Bureau of Canada for their dedication to raising awareness of the need for detectors and their generous efforts to provide them through fire departments to people in need.", "All of these efforts are making a difference. We are hearing from fire departments about people who installed detectors because of this law and that some of those detectors have already gone off, alerting home owners to a carbon monoxide leak and likely saving their lives. Those stories make all of these efforts worthwhile. We need to make sure that the families in all homes in Ontario with fuel-burning appliances or an attached garage are protected by having a carbon monoxide detector, and to make sure that this week everyone takes a minute to check that their detectors are working." ],

So while the ministry claims it has integrated financial literacy into the curriculum, clearly there’s a disconnect and the government has work to do.", "We hope the government will take steps to put greater and more specific emphasis on financial literacy, so that the next generation can manage money a whole lot better in the future." ],

Numerous councils have passed resolutions of support.", "The member from Wellington–Halton Hills—a good colleague of mine, Mr. Ted Arnott—has fought very hard to make this change, over a decade. I’m glad that he will see this issue get resolved after so many years of effort on his part.", "His work received expressions of support from the Fire Fighters’ Association of Ontario, representing volunteer firefighters, by the way; the Association of Fire Chiefs of Ontario; the Association of Municipalities of Ontario; and the Fire Marshal of Ontario.", "Schedule 1 of this bill seeks to address this issue, as well as a few others. Bill 109 incorporates significant portions of the Labour Relations Act into the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, including unfair labour practices, membership in associations and expedited rights arbitration. Bill 109 would, in fact, allow labour disputes under the Fire Protection and Prevention Act to be heard by the Ontario Labour Relations Board as opposed to an Ontario court. This is something I support, given the tremendous backlog of cases that our province’s court system is currently struggling with. This seems like a win-win, as we have labour disputes for firefighters handled more effectively and efficiently while also reducing the burden on our justice system.", "The bill will also permit associations to require the inclusion of closed-shop language in a collective agreement, with features such as mandatory association dues deductions and provisions requiring membership in the association, or giving preference of employment to members of an association. This can be seen as a positive for the firefighter unions. This measure is balanced by the fact that the bill would allow double-hatters to continue their work without fear of reprisal, which is something that firefighter unions have argued against for the past several years here in Ontario.", "With any labour laws in the province, there needs to be proper balance. The balance is between a respect for the needs of workers and the needs of employers. When it comes to changes to the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, there are elements that both firefighters and their unions can in fact agree with. The changes to the Fire Protection and Prevention Act have been developed in consultation with the Ontario Professional Fire Fighters Association, and they seem reasonable as a whole.", "We look forward, Speaker, to hearing input from individual firefighters and associations during committee to get further feedback on this bill so that we can make it as beneficial as possible for the brave men and women who risk their lives to help keep us safe.", "Many firefighters around the province are happy to see this piece of legislation tabled by the Minister of Labour. At the same time, they may be concerned about what is not included in Bill 109, nor any piece of government legislation that has been tabled to date. Countless firefighters and other first responders, and also the province’s correctional officers, are anxiously awaiting some action to be taken by the minister when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder, also known as PTSD. Our first responders know that seconds matter. For our first responders suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, seconds can feel a lot longer. That’s why they’re frustrated by this government’s stubborn unwillingness to support a good idea when they see it.", "The Minister of Labour said, in question period, “I’m convinced that we must do a combination of what’s envisioned in Bill 2, with some improvements to it.” Well, Speaker, I can’t speak for the member from Parkdale–High Park, but I’m confident that she would be willing to have friendly amendments made to her bill if it means that the province will tackle the problem of PTSD sooner rather than later. We already have a bill on the table with full opposition support. It’s also received support from the government, at least at second reading.", "If you have improvements to the bill, do it at committee. Let police officers, firefighters, EMS personnel and correctional officers explain to Ontarians how post-traumatic stress disorder impacts their lives. Bill 109 is already opening up the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act and making amendments to it. Perhaps this can be an opportunity for the government to address this critical issue. Instead, the government has, thus far, indicated that it wants to introduce its own bill, and hold consultations away from the public. Speaker, there’s no need to go back to square one on an issue that is clearly non-partisan, where seconds matter, let alone weeks or months. There must be room for compromise and co-operation.", "When our first responders show up at a scene, they simply do their jobs. They don’t play politics or bicker with each other about who gets credit. They see a problem and they do whatever they can to fix it, together. That’s what they expect of their politicians, and that’s what they deserve.", "Whether it’s a third-party bill or a future piece of legislation from the Minister of Labour, we are committed to helping our heroes who are suffering from PTSD. Perhaps this issue could be addressed when Bill 109 heads to the committee stage.", "Let me wrap up my comments today by stating that I do support Bill 109 at second reading. While the changes found in schedule 1 seem reasonable, members of the official opposition have expressed some concern, or at least they feel that there are some questions that should be addressed when it comes to the changes to the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act and the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act. We feel that more public discussion is required for Bill 109 and that public hearings at the committee stage are, in fact, necessary.", "I do look forward to the passage of Bill 109 at second reading and the protection of double-hatter firefighters. I also look forward to the strengthening of the bill in committee." ],

They’re very hard-working people, but they get hurt on the job. And then there are all kinds of situations where sometimes the employer will try to supress that worker’s injury. That is something that is not acceptable. That’s one of the important aspects of Bill 109, where there is an attempt to stop the suppression of reporting workplace injuries. If you’re hurt on the job, you have every right to go to the WSIB and present your case and get the protection offered to you under Ontario law." ],

Workers are able to vote a union in when two workplaces merge, kind of like hospitals or municipalities. But it is taking rights away from those workers. It’s really saying that the majority of members in one particular union de facto—the whole voting process is not democratic. The member from Kitchener–Waterloo hit it right on the head, that once you take certain rights away, you never get them back, because then it becomes the norm. It becomes the norm not to have those rights, to use your democratic process, your right to vote.", "Absolutely, Speaker, there’s a lot to talk about in this bill.

There are areas in here that we talk about: that employers are not reporting injuries because they get a bonus, they get some kind of incentive, not to report these injuries.

When you modify a number of bills or a number of sections within one bill, it creates problems, because there are components of a bill that make sense and there are components that don’t make sense, so it creates a difficulty in terms of those who want to support components but oppose very strongly other components.", "It also ties into the notion of cynical politics, because you can avoid conflicts by making sure there are certain areas people agree on, and put those forward and everyone agrees. The areas that are contentious can be carved out and those can be debated, because they’re contentious. When you wrap in areas that people agree with and areas that people don’t agree with purposefully in a bill, it really fuels this notion that parties are more concerned with encouraging divisive politics, politics where people are unable to come to consensus, as opposed to working towards creating more harmonious legislation. That is very common when it comes to this government.", "Let’s talk about the various schedules. With respect to schedule 1, issues around ensuring there is fairness and various interested parties have rights that are offered to other parties, ensuring that there’s consistency: These types of issues are not overly contentious.", "When we move into schedule 2, this is a very clear attempt of the government stripping a fundamental right. There’s really no other way to put it. It’s pretty blatant. It’s pretty overt. That workers should be entitled to vote on their representation is a very fundamental element of workplace democracy. What’s really ironic is that we’re here in the Legislature, which is supposed to be the pinnacle of democracy—this is the final arbiter of decisions when it comes to how the province is governed. For the government to come up with a bill that takes away the right to vote, in scenarios where 60% of workers can impose on 40% of workers, just doesn’t make sense. One of the members brought it up before—the member from Kitchener–Waterloo: What is the purpose of that? Why is the government seeking to remove this ability for workers to choose who they want to represent them? Why is that even a factor? Why is that something that’s a priority? Why did the government put this component into this bill? Mr. Speaker, I ask you: Why did the government do this? It really makes no sense. If we talk about fundamental principles of democracy, why would you want to get rid of this ability to vote? Why is the government choosing this as a priority? It simply boggles my mind.", "In fact, what we’ve seen is when the government makes decisions to override these sorts of fundamental principles, often these are challenged in court, and the government incurs considerable legal costs to fight something that they probably will end up losing. There’s some jurisprudence that shows that these types of decisions—in this case, where the government is trying to strip a right to vote—very well may be challenged in court and this law might be deemed unconstitutional. Then, we have the added cost to an already wasteful government for something that, really, has no benefit to the workers, and I struggle to see how it benefits us in a broad sense.", "Then, schedule 3 of the bill touches on something that’s quite important. I know a number of members in this House, I’m sure, have had constituents come to their offices and complain about what’s going on in the WSIB. So appointing an ombudsman to address some of those concerns seems to be a step in the right direction. But what we really need to see is an overhaul of the WSIB. We need to see a significant improvement in the way it’s structured and in the way it’s working, because there are some serious problems. There’s no way you can tell me that you’re not getting the same complaints that we’re getting in our offices about the WSIB." ],

Our member from Oshawa has put forward Bill 98, which actually goes much further and is a much more comprehensive and really a much more fair bill. It addresses issues around loss of earnings and survivor benefits and does so in a manner that’s more wholesome and accounts for the realities of workers. It looks at latent illnesses, instead of ignoring this as a reality, instead of putting arbitrary time limitations and denying benefits simply for the purpose of just denying benefits and, really, no other purpose—finding an excuse to deny a benefit which should be provided and applying time limitations where the only purpose of this limitation is just to find another way to deny a claim. I implore you, with respect to Bill 109, to take our member’s Bill 98 and implement it. Our member from Oshawa has developed a very comprehensive bill, and we encourage you to implement it. We hope you do.", "When we’re talking about employment and labour law and the fact that the government is addressing this in this bill and is trying to tackle some of the issues, I implore the government to address a very large concern when it comes to employment law in this province. It’s the issue of precarious employment. Precarious employment is one of the major concerns of people across this province. More and more, we’re seeing people who are being hired in precarious positions and people who are hired in part-time employment with no sense of when they’re going to be called in for work and no sense of security.", "The Law Commission of Ontario did a very comprehensive report, as did many other organizations, and went into discussion around the impact of precarious employment. Precarious employment has significant impacts on family lives and on individual stress levels, and it impacts people’s wages. In fact, a report commissioned by McMaster University and the United Way talks about the fact that with precarious employment, when you don’t have secure employment you’re less likely to be engaged in civic responsibilities. You’re less likely to be engaged in your school and less likely to be engaged in your community, because you don’t feel as worthy. These are some serious issues.", "It is important to note that over the past 10 years—the past decade—there has been a phenomenal increase in temporary and precarious employment, particularly in temporary agencies. I quote a newspaper article written by Sara Mojtehedzadeh, published on May 10, 2015. She writes, “The province’s employment services sector earned $5.7 billion in revenue in 2012, a near 72% jump from 2002. Temporary agencies account for an estimated 60% of that industry’s total revenue.”", "I point to a 72% increase in temporary agencies in the past decade. Guess who was in power over the past decade. Guess whose responsibility it is that we have seen such an increase in temporary job agencies. It’s this government, the Liberal government of Ontario. It is under this government’s rule that temporary job agencies have increased and we find racialized people, women, new immigrants and new Canadians disproportionally impacted by this. The responsibility and the fault lie squarely at the feet of this government.", "I call on the government to address the issue of precarious employment.

This type of employment is damaging our society. It’s significantly impacting our communities. We know that this issue of precarious employment is impacting racialized individuals and new Canadians; it’s particularly impacting women as well. It’s a serious issue that needs to be addressed. We also know that since 2002 to 2012 there have been clear studies that have shown that this industry’s profits have increased by 72% during this time; they have skyrocketed in profits. The industry has increased significantly under this government’s rule.", "The government may claim that they care about this issue, but they created the problem. They created the problem by allowing temporary agencies to flourish and by making it far easier to hire someone temporarily than to hire them permanently. It’s far easier in this province to hire someone on a temporary, part-time basis than it is to hire them in a permanent position. That’s simply unacceptable.", "This province needs to do more to ensure that employers can hire people in a permanent manner and to make that easier to do, as opposed to hiring them through an agency, which has now become the easier way to hire.", "I ask this government to take some serious action on this file. The track record of this government is abysmal. We ask you to improve the situation and ensure that people can get full-time, permanent, good-paying jobs in this province." ],

As the third party has indicated, they see this as an omnibus bill, and it does deal with several different statutes and amends said statutes. I want to speak about a couple of them myself here.", "I do want to speak about schedule 1, which is one that is of great interest to me. I come from a rural part of the province, as most of you people know, the great riding of Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke. I would say, somewhat subjectively, I represent the best people in this province, and I’m proud to do so. They’re very hard-working people who look forward to a hard day’s work and being rewarded for it fairly.", "One of the challenges we have in rural Ontario, of course, is fire protection. As any of you people know who live or have vacation homes or wherever in this vast province, the ability to provide fire protection becomes somewhat more difficult as the distance between a fire station and the dwellings becomes longer and longer.", "One of the things that has been a contentious issue and that I think this bill helps to address is the issue of double-hatters, or two-hatters, as they are referred to. That is a firefighter who is employed as a professional in the Ontario Professional Fire Fighters Association but also has connections or maybe a home in an area that is not serviced by a professional department.", "In my riding of Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, I really don’t have much in the line—I have Pembroke, Petawawa, Renfrew—very few which are professional departments, and we have a number of volunteer departments. What is difficult is a situation that has cropped up in my riding more than once, and that is someone who works for a professional department elsewhere—I remember a gentleman; I won’t use the name because I haven’t talked to him about it. I’m not even sure if he lives in my riding anymore. He was a professional firefighter here in Toronto, and he had property, which he spent a lot of time at, in the Killaloe area. He volunteered on the Killaloe-Hagarty-Richards fire department, and he was always under a great deal of pressure back here to stop doing that. They didn’t want him doing that. In fact, he was always under threats of possible sanctions by his union for providing his expertise and services to the fire department back in my riding. It was a win-win, as far as we were concerned, because he was a professional firefighter in Toronto—he got all the training there, as well. He could impart some of that knowledge and that training as a professional firefighter to our firefighters back home. It makes perfect sense. When he would be home sometimes, there was no issue of danger or him being overworked. He was at home, sometimes, for two or three weeks, on holidays. He could be of great service to the people in my riding. But he was always under increasing pressure to not continue as a volunteer firefighter. I’m not sure that at some point—because this goes back even before I was an MPP—he didn’t give up on being a volunteer in the fire department because of the pressures that were brought to bear on him.", "I remember, before I was elected, I had a discussion with Ted Arnott. It wasn’t Wellington–Halton Hills then; I forget what riding it might have been, at the time, that he was representing. He was pushing this double-hatter issue very, very strongly, as a private member’s bill. He was one of the guys I contacted. I talked to him, before I was ever elected, about his pursuit in double-hatters and got to understand his dedication to the issue and how it could be helpful to others of us in other places in the province. So it was an issue that I was aware of before I ever got elected. Here it is, some 12 years later, that the government has actually moved in this bill in a way that I think will be helpful in resolving that issue.", "The other issue is, of course, in schedule 2. I share some of the concerns of my friends in the third party. I understand the logistical desire to make these transitions easier.", "I apologize, Speaker, if I turned my back on you. That was totally unintentional.", "I understand the logistical challenges, sometimes, if there are two unions within a workplace and there’s talk of amalgamation and they want to make it maybe a little simpler. What the government has done is, if 60% of the unionized people at that workplace are in your union, you simply absorb the members of the other union and one union represents it. But what would be wrong with just letting people vote? What would be wrong with just allowing the democratic process to take place? I’m a big believer in democracy. I see in this House how democracy gets subverted, many times when the opposition is not even allowed to debate an issue beyond the desire of the government, because they feel that it’s gone on long enough.", "But I also want to point out to those people who are concerned about democracy that we have an issue in this province: card-based certification, which is a big concern to me. In my riding, we had unions go into an electrical shop on New Year’s Eve when three of 30 people were working, got two of them to sign a union card, and the next day that shop was unionized. By the way, that was a year and a half ago, or almost two years ago; that company is out of business. The IBEW went in, unionized it—that company is out of business. Not because the workers didn’t have the democratic right to vote as to whether or not they wanted to join the IBEW—no. They simply went in, got two people out of three who were working that day to sign it, and anybody became a member of the union.", "I don’t have a lot of time, but I do want to talk—there’s also the issue of the changes to the WSIB. My goodness, I won’t have time to talk about all the issues, but if there’s ever a place where changes could be made, it certainly is the WSIB. But I’ll just relate a little story of how life has changed when it comes to workers’ compensation. I had the opportunity to talk to my friend from London–Fanshawe about this earlier today. We were talking about how life has changed in this Legislature and the work of an MPP.", "I was talking to a gentleman last year while I was having my truck serviced. He starts talking to me—my dad was elected here in 1963—and says, “Your dad really helped me.” I said, “I’m really pleased when I hear about those stories.” He said, “Yes. I got hurt on the job in construction. It was five months. I hadn’t received a penny. I was in the Bo-Peep Restaurant in Eganville having a coffee, and your dad was in there having a coffee with Harry Searson. They were talking, and your dad comes over to me, because Harry probably told him that I was having trouble with WSIB”—at that time, it was workers’ compensation. “Your dad comes over and he says, ‘How’s it going with the compensation?’ And I told him, ‘Not worth a darn. At five months, I haven’t had a penny. We’re living on dust.’”", "That was a Friday morning. He said the next Wednesday, he had all his back cheques; five months were all paid. Never had another problem with the workers’ compensation. Now that was the way—I’ll give my dad a lot of the credit, because he was a bulldog. But at the same time, it’s how the world has changed as well. How people were able to get things done in those days because we weren’t encumbered by such a gigantic system that bogs progress down sometimes.", "But that’s just one story. I could tell you a million stories about things that my dad did for people. And you know who the big beneficiary of it has been today? It has been me, because I then received the support of my constituents many, many times because of things that my dad did for them in the past, or their parents or grandparents, because it goes back a long way. He was elected 52 years ago.", "But, anyway, does the WSIB need some work? Oh, yes, it does. Will this bill address all of the needs? No, it won’t. There are a lot of things to be done. I don’t have that much time left, but we’ll look forward to having a chance to discuss this at a later date." ],

All of us in our respective ridings hear about WSIB every single day.", "There are procedural provisions against claim suppression, which is good, but the problem is that—so it prohibits employers from suppressing claims directly or indirectly, and then employers, if they’re found guilty of claim suppression, can be fined up to $500,000. But the big missing piece, Mr. Speaker, is that there is no language in the bill around procedural mechanisms for enforcement or prevention of employers from receiving annual rebates.", "You know, the language can be beautiful; it can be. The intention can even be there, but if there’s no oversight, if there’s no mechanism to ensure that the legislation is actually being upheld, then it means nothing. There is a pattern of legislation coming forward from this government and it having huge weaknesses in it. This has been a serious criticism that we have had. If you’re going to craft a piece of legislation, build it right and consult.", "The other piece where there was no consultation was on schedule 2; the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke also references that. This is removing the requirement of a vote, in the case of a merger, if one of the existing bargaining agents meets the minimum threshold. So if a new bargaining unit meets that threshold, a vote is not required. There has been no call for this change from our labour partners and there was no consultation on this particular issue.

When I got elected, I didn’t realize there were that many problems with the WSIB until I had to start dealing with everyone else’s problems. It’s not a simple system. It’s not that if you get hurt in the workplace, you go and make a claim and—you know what?—you’re protected. It doesn’t work like that anymore, Speaker. Maybe it used to, but it doesn’t. It’s basically a for-profit or minimize-loss agency, and their first response is to deny and deny and, once again, deny.

This bill was introduced in the Legislature just before the end of the sitting, with a last-minute notice given the same day it was introduced. Simply put, this is an omnibus bill that contains a number of changes to the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act and the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act.", "Speaker, I have some concerns with this bill, specifically in regard to the proposed changes to the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act. This section of Bill 109 includes a provision that provides regulation-making authority regarding bargaining units in the case of mergers in hospitals, school boards and municipalities. While doing this, it removes the requirement of a vote in case of a merger if one of the existing bargaining agents meets the threshold of 60% of total membership. This means that if a new bargaining unit meets the threshold, there is no vote required for workers. I don’t understand how a government can even legislate taking your democratic power away to vote who you want representation from. That, Speaker, is unfathomable, that we can legislate things like that.", "Again, I can’t begin to explain how dangerous this is to labour unions across the province and to the workers they represent. We should not and cannot take away the democratic rights of workers in the case of an amalgamation or merger. We as New Democrats oppose this change, as do major public service unions representing thousands of workers.", "I would like to share some words from the president of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union who was concerned about this proposed change: “If Bill 109, as currently drafted, passes into law then a worker will lose the right to determine which union he or she chooses to represent them. That is fundamentally unjust and it ignores the principle of workplace democracy....”", "“In a merger vote, workers should be entitled to judge each union on their own merits. Bill 109 rewards one union for having signed up the most members compared to the other union. It doesn’t allow for members to decide for themselves which is the stronger union with respect to negotiating, or enforcing, a good collective agreement. The proposed legislation snatches away that entitlement.” Those are the words of the OPSEU president.", "This proposed legislation would absolutely and clearly snatch away the rights of workers. I really don’t even know how to put into words how ridiculously wrong schedule 2 is in the bill.", "OPSEU is not the only group opposed to this change. The Canadian Union of Public Employees, the Ontario Nurses’ Association and the Ontario Federation of Labour have all called this into question.

Yet, they stand there and say, “But this bill is all about strengthening protection for workers.” Schedule 2 is removing their democratic rights. It’s got nothing to do with protecting any worker.

If you come from an urban centre like Toronto, for instance, you might have no idea, if a vehicle pulls up behind you with a green flashing light, that you’re supposed to pull off to the side of the road and allow them to pass because they’re on their way to a fire, a motor vehicle accident or some other type of potentially tragic situation.", "The Belleville fire department, at its own expense, made up these signs to put on the local roads, advising people from out of town—the Bay of Quinte tourism area is quite a hot spot for people from urban centres to come visit these days because of our award-winning wines.

The Ministry of Transportation isn’t allowing them to put the signs up on their provincial highways. Hopefully we can work together with the Minister of Transportation.

I do agree with the members of the third party when they stomp their feet and point at the government, saying that the democratic rights of workers are being removed in schedule 2 of the bill. I actually do agree with them on that. The thing that surprises me most is that the government is saying that when two unions come together in one workplace, and you have one union representing 60% and another representing 40%, 60% is larger and should therefore swallow up the 40% in the other union.", "The thing that’s amazing to me is that the members of the government are saying that 60% is more than 40%. Because when you look at the Hydro One sell-off that’s occurring right now, they believe that by having a 40% share in Hydro One, they have the majority of Hydro One, yet when it comes to this bill, clearly they know that 60% is larger than 40%. It’s amazing to me that they’ve been able to draw that distinction. I would fully agree with them that 60 is more than 40; however, when it comes to Hydro One, it’s a completely different story.", "In the second schedule of the act, we’ve got several interesting questions being raised by amendments that the government raises. Currently, when a workplace is represented by two or more unions, as I just described, the members vote on which union they want to have representing their bargaining unit, and that is as it should be. In instances like this, democracy should always win out, and it harms no one to simply conduct that vote to determine which union will represent the workforce there. This provision has kept some major unions from supporting this bill, and it’s completely unnecessary.", "It’s likely that this measure is a reaction to an issue that occurred last year, when the government forced the merger of the OPA and the IESO and ran into workplaces represented by multiple unions. That having been said, a founding principle of the organized labour movement has always been the democratic contributions of its members and their right to participate in their governance and the bargaining process. It’s interesting here that the government would seek to amend a process that has existed for decades, and simply state that if 60% of a workforce belongs to a union, the other 40% of employees are automatically represented by that union, by virtue of working in the same workplace.", "This government does, however, have a tendency to undermine the democratic process at times, especially in local municipalities when it suits them. We’ve seen that borne out in legislation in this House, time and time again. We’re seeing it borne out with the Hydro One sell-off—the Hydro One fire sale that’s currently occurring. One hundred and eighty-five municipalities have said they’re not in favour of selling Hydro One. Were they ever given an opportunity to provide any input on the sell-off of Hydro One? No, they weren’t. The fire sale of Hydro One has been anything but a democratic process. We’ve seen it with the Green Energy Act. The municipalities have actually had planning authority taken away from them as a result of the Green Energy Act and now, to a much smaller but still significant extent, in this bill, in schedule 2.", "The final schedule of this bill deals with the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act. I know, as we’ve discussed here this afternoon, that WSIB claims are some of the most frequent issues we deal with in our constituency offices every day. Every time we start dealing with the WSIB legislation, we have to use a scalpel instead of a butcher knife to cut away at it. As the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane said, when you phone the WSIB looking for an answer for one of your constituents, it’s always deny, deny, deny. I agree with him wholeheartedly on that. It’s a big problem for all of us in our constituency offices, and nothing is happening to fix that problem. It’s something we are all dealing with.", "While we will be supporting this bill and we look forward to some amendments—the members of the third party are looking for the complete removal, I believe, of schedule 2 of the act when it does get to committee. We will be supporting this at second reading to get it to committee.", "It’s important to clean up legislation from time to time, and what we’re seeing cleaned up hasn’t been fixed up since 1997.

Just for those people who are watching, which includes my mom and maybe my husband: Bill 109, Employment and Labour Statute Law Amendment Act, 2015—there are three parts to this piece of legislation. It contains amendments to three different bills on three separate and equally important issues, two of which come at the expense of one, which is the poison pill. I’m going to address schedule 2 in a few minutes.", "I do want to speak to the entire culture of how legislation comes through to this House. Quite honestly, these omnibus bills that come before us, which—for no good reason; there is no good rationale to do so, and it runs counter to that narrative that we heard from this Premier and from this cabinet that there would be an openness and there would be a transparency to how legislation flows in this place, because people wanted to ensure that legislation would meet the needs of the people that we are elected to serve here in this place.", "Unfortunately, we are seeing a pattern from this government—now we’re well into this session—it’s copying the former federal government, where there is so much in a bill, and yet it doesn’t address—there’s always a hook, if you will.", "We heard about this activist centre—do you remember that, Mr. Speaker?—and that legislation would be progressive and that it would be responding to the needs, the expressed needs, evidence-based needs, of the people of this province.", "There isn’t anything progressive about this legislation, particularly schedule 2, which involves the stripping of rights of employees to vote for who will represent them. That’s a core issue. We will never support any piece of legislation that has this caveat contained within it, and the Liberal government knows that. Yet, they still crafted this piece of legislation with it. Instead of trying to get unanimous support going forward, instead of trying to find consensus—they’re going to do what they’re going to do. Clearly, they already have.", "But this activist centre concept, that’s clearly been abandoned, although, quite honestly, there are not a lot of people who really understand what it meant in the first place. It was thought to look like something that might be considered to be progressive. Stripping the rights of employees to choose their representation in the workplace—there isn’t anything progressive about that. Certainly, the biggest transfer of wealth from the public sector to the private sector through the sell-off of Hydro One—there isn’t anything progressive about that either. I feel like there’s this giant walking contradiction in this place, and it is our job, obviously, as opposition members to draw attention to some of those weaknesses.", "In this piece, in Bill 109, I’ll give you an example. The issue of WSIB, as has already been stated here in the House all afternoon, is that this is a broken system. It is a long-standing problem for the people of this province who become injured in the workplace and who are seeking compensation—and, in some cases, just seeking compassion. In fact, tomorrow, our labour critic, the member from Welland, is going to be hosting some medical professionals and psychologists who are coming here to Queen’s Park to expose the fact that WSIB has interfered in the medical care of workers in the province of Ontario. That’s a serious issue, but it is not a new issue, and all of us know that.", "In fact, even going back to May 2012, even after it was included as a key recommendation of the Arthurs commission report of May 2012, it still took the government over three years to implement legislation. There’s no need for this. I mean, it is truly about priorities. Some people would say that rushing the sale of Hydro One has moved at breakneck pace. Yet there are issues pertaining to the safety of workers in the province of Ontario that move as slowly as possible. One only has to consider, for instance, the safety of workers who work at heights, which obviously is more and more; or the issue of temporary agencies and the influx of workers who are precarious, part-time and contractual workers in the province of Ontario: This, apparently, is a priority for this government, but not addressing those key safety issues.", "The main issue I have primarily, though, with schedule 3 of this is that, while we do, of course, support the procedural provisions against claim suppression, which we know is an issue with the WSIB and workers—it expressly prohibits employers from suppressing claims directly or indirectly. This is good. This is a good piece of the legislation. Employers who are found guilty of claim suppression can be fined up to $500,000. That’s up from $100,000. That’s good. We hope that that might be a deterrent for employers to try to suppress claims. But there is no language in this bill around procedural mechanisms for enforcement or prevention, so you can’t ensure that these good intentions are actually going to be followed through on.", "We also have Bill 98, which the government did support. This was our member from Oshawa, Ms. French, who brought forward an excellent bill which is more comprehensive, which is more responsive and which there was extensive consultation on.", "The Ontario Federation of Labour, as it relates to schedule 3, states that schedule 3 of Bill 109 doesn’t go far enough and only goes halfway. This is the pattern for this government. Why not fix it now? There’s no excuse. There were excuses in the past: that it was a minority government and that things couldn’t move forward—which actually, in my view, was untrue. Minority governments actually provided greater opportunity for us to work together to find consensus and to actually listen to each other and work together. I think that the people of this province primarily were served well in that respect.", "Schedule 2 is obviously the non-negotiable piece of the legislation. Just for those who are watching, schedule 2 of Bill 109 removes the requirement of a vote in the case of a merger if one of the existing bargaining agents meets the minimum threshold of 60% of total membership. So if a new bargaining unit meets that threshold, a vote is not required. Of course, we oppose this, as do all of the major public service unions, representing thousands of workers. Why would you put this piece in? There’s no good rationale. There’s no good reason. It ignores and overrides the basic principles of workplace democracy. You wouldn’t find a move like this in the activist centre, as far as I could tell. There isn’t anything progressive about this, and there was no consultation on the overall issue. People would genuinely be surprised. I know that you must be feeling some pressure coming from your constituency.", "Also, it’s not a burning issue versus the countless other labour issues that are long-standing here in the province of Ontario. So this is something that we will not back down on. It’s a core principle that people have the right in their workplaces to come together and to have a vote—to have a democratic process where they are part of that conversation—and select their leadership and to select their representation.", "So here we have a piece of legislation which has some good components of it, but there’s this hook that will prevent us from supporting it. As I’ve said, bringing forward a piece of legislation like this really just adds to the entire cynicism that is growing in the political arena of this province. It’s discouraging; it truly is. I think that people in this province deserve better. They deserve more from their politicians. We should set the bar higher when legislation comes to this floor for debate. Obviously we cannot be supportive of it, and we’d be looking to amend and remove schedule 2 in its entirety." ],

It was a letter from Injured Worker Outreach Services, which represents 14 autonomous injured worker groups across the province. The groups are partially funded by WSIB. As a whole, the groups assist and represent thousands of injured workers. I’ve got a few bullets of a direct quote from their letter. All of the quotes pertain to this bill.", "“After careful consideration of the bill, the IWOS groups’ signatories to this document are pleased to offer our support and congratulations to you on these much-needed changes.", "“Injured workers’ survivors will especially benefit from the changes you have outlined in section 48.1. We are especially pleased that this long-standing issue is being addressed and rectified.”", "The letter goes on to say, about sections 22.1 and 155.5: “The proposed changes to the issue of claims suppression are also long overdue. The groups are certainly in support of these increases in the financial penalty from $100,000 to $500,000 for employers who discourage workers in filing claims.”", "Mr. Speaker, one final point the letter makes, about section 176.1: “Enshrining a Fair Practices Commissioner and the commission in legislation will ensure that workers have an independent ombudsman they can contact when those issues arise.”" ],

I’m hearing from the third party how serious they are about the fact that there should be a majority of workers that have some say in what organization represents them. I think that flies in the face of the construction industry, where we don’t see that. We’ve had cases in my riding of two people with a card working on a weekend, or a case a couple of years ago in Renfrew, on a New Year’s Eve, where they organized a whole company, against the wishes of the vast majority. They aren’t given an opportunity to exercise their democratic rights. This was put in by the government on the other side and of course endorsed by this side here. I don’t know where the difference is.", "In that case here and the one in Renfrew, more than half of the people involved quit because they didn’t want to work under the basis of the union in that case. Where are the differences? In that case, two people were able to exercise their will over 40 or 45 other workers. That has happened in my riding; it has happened in numerous places across this province.", "We agree. We think things like that should be democratically—the opportunity should be to choose your own organized labour. I don’t know why the difference. I introduced a bill in the last term and reintroduced it in this term again. We didn’t get support from the third party or from the party opposite here, the government.", "I think it’s a very poorly understood issue across the public. I know it has garnered a lot of support for this government during some of the elections, but I think it’s the wrong thing to do and I think it’s time for that to change." ],

I want to mention how ironic it is that in this place, which is a place of democracy, a place where we all represent our communities—we have been elected to represent our communities—the government would enact legislation that would remove a democratic right.", "There are different circumstances that apply. I want to point out some significant differences between what the member who just spoke from the Conservative Party pointed out with respect to card certification and what we’re talking about today with respect to the membership choosing who they want to represent them as a bargaining unit. In circumstances where there are mergers, where a hospital is merged with a larger hospital, the workers should have a right to choose whether to remain with their existing bargaining unit, move in with the incoming bargaining unit, or some alternative. They should be able to choose that. They’re already in an organized labour position. They’re going to decide who to go with.", "That scenario is a very different scenario than whether or not we want to make it easier for people to organize. In general, it’s very clear; the evidence shows that wherever there is organized labour, people have better working conditions, both in the public and in the private sector. The evidence is absolutely clear that workers enjoy more rights and that society has better conditions for workers. That is something that we can look at with very clear objective evidence. On this issue, though, it’s absolutely clear that being able to choose who represents you is fundamentally important." ],

I was speaking, in my first turnaround at this, to the significant amendments to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act. I listened to one of my colleagues, the member for Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington, make reference to the increase in the penalties that will be put in place, going up to $500,000. The point that I would have made were I able to get up again and respond would have been to say, “That’s why it’s important: We’re increasing protection.” I don’t think the member disagrees with me on that. I think that’s an important element.", "I think there are a number of parts of this legislation, particularly related to the WSIA, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act—greater fairness for survivors, I think, is another important element, in cases of work-related death. Bill 109 would enable the WSIB to calculate survivor benefits based on the average earnings of a worker engaged in the same profession as that out of which the deceased worker’s injury arose.", "These may seem like things that are relatively obvious because they make sense. The fact is, I think it’s important that we put these clear protections in place. With my number of years now as MPP for Thunder Bay–Superior North, one of the most important relationships that I’ve had from the very beginning, when I first got elected until now, is with the Thunder Bay and District Injured Workers Support Group, who do remarkable work on behalf of the people who need it perhaps the most.", "I’m delighted to stand here and support the legislation." ],

It is interesting that there’s nothing substantive coming back as far as the rationale around schedule 2, which specifically is our concern. It’s disappointing that there’s no commentary, there’s no rationale and there is no good reason for this section, the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act, to be contained within this piece of legislation. So one has to wonder why it is there. Why would this government actively and aggressively be moving to override the basic principles of workplace democracy? Why?", "I think that that is the overriding question. Why isn’t this government doing a number of things? Why is this government selling off Hydro One and transferring wealth from the public sector to the private sector? Why is this government continuing to bring forward pieces of legislation like this, which involve the stripping of rights of workers in the workplace?", "All that we can do is raise our voices in this place and bring the concerns of our constituents to the floor of this Legislature and hope that someday, at some point, this government decides to listen to the real concerns of Ontarians and bring forward legislation which is truly progressive and meets the needs of workers in the province of Ontario." ],

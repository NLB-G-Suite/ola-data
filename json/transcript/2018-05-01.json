The hurt is so bad that they had to remortgage the house so that the people won’t be paying these contracts for 30 years; now they’ll be paying them for 60 years. What is interesting, though, is that they have a little bit of buyer’s remorse.", "Do you remember George Smitherman? Do you remember Furious George?

It was entertaining, though, and it did give me some things to talk about.", "I think it’s important to note that we are here once again with the Liberal government time-allocating an important discussion. This is something they’ve done time and time again. For those who are out there watching or that might read the Hansard later and don’t know what time allocation is, basically time allocation is the government’s way of saying that they don’t want to talk about the legislation; they just want to push it through and make it law without having fulsome debate, without wanting to hear from the other MPPs in the Legislature, whether that’s opposition or some of their own members. And they don’t want to hear from the people of this province. That’s what time allocation means: They’re shutting down conversation about a bill.", "I want to point out something that’s interesting. There’s an article in the Toronto Star today with an interview that was done with the Speaker of the House, the member from Brant, Speaker Levac, who, as we all know, is retiring. He’s not going to run again, and I wish him well, wherever life takes him after retirement. Speaker Levac actually said this in the interview: “Levac says Liberal government dominance of legislative debates has also set a poor precedent, citing the ‘excessive use of time allocation’ measures to rush bills into law through closure tactics that limit the opposition’s say.”", "It’s important to point out that Speaker Levac, although when he is here is non-partisan, is a member of the Liberal Party. He is an elected MPP who ran under the Liberal banner, and here he is saying that the Liberal government uses time allocation excessively to shut down the voice of the people in this House and to shut down the voice of Ontarians.", "When the Liberal government moves time allocation, what they are saying—not just to opposition MPP constituents, but to the people they represent, those that sent them to this place—is, “We don’t want to hear from you.” I cannot stress this enough for the people who are watching this or who will read the Hansard later: When the Liberal members that you elected in your ridings support time allocation, what they are saying to you, their constituents, is, “We don’t want to hear from you. Your opinion doesn’t matter.”", "So remember that come June 7, when you are standing in the polling station deciding who you are going to support. If you have supported Liberal members in the past who are sitting in this House now with time allocation shutting down debate, they are saying that they don’t want to hear from you, and your opinion doesn’t matter.", "What’s even more alarming is that they don’t want to hold committee and hear from the people of this province and get their input. They are not interested in that this time either. They have had about 10 years to deal with this legislation, which they have now decided they need to rush through on the eve of an election, and they don’t want to consult the people of this province. That’s shameful, because every single one of us in this House was elected to represent every constituent in our riding; whether they voted for us or not, whether they can vote or not, we are sent here to bring the voice of our constituents. The Liberals don’t want to hear from us and they don’t want to hear from their constituents. They are not doing their job, frankly.", "I want to talk a little bit about this, because it’s about government contract wages—and not wanting to talk about government contract wages, apparently, on the Liberal side. I think it’s important to point out some of the stuff that’s going on across this province right now as far as people who are working in government jobs, directly or indirectly, and people who work in institutions that are publicly funded. All we have to do is look at what’s going on at York University, where for, I believe nine weeks now, they have been out on the picket line because this Liberal government chooses to underfund the post-secondary education institutions in this province, whether that’s universities or colleges.", "We just went through a very long college strike, and the Liberals let that go on and on for I believe five weeks or more without doing anything about it, without truly addressing—that’s not true. What they did about it was they tabled back-to-work legislation, which was supported by the Conservatives; what they did was they forced the faculty back to work without actually addressing the issues that caused the strike in the first place.", "That is exactly what they are doing now at York University. They’re not addressing the fact that we have more contract faculty, more part-time faculty, more people who are there to provide an education—a darn good education—so that people can go out and make a decent living to fill the gaps in our job sector.", "There are many areas where they need skilled workers, and we have faculty who are trying to educate the next generation and fill those gaps, and they’re not respected. More and more of them are contract, part-time and precarious employment. That isn’t the way that we should be treating the people who are put in charge of educating our next generation or those who have had to return to post-secondary education and then move on to another career. This is not how we should be treating the faculty. They shouldn’t be starving out our post-secondary institutions so that more and more they’re having to decide to hire contract faculty.", "The students who pay to be there deserve no less than to know that their faculty will be there whenever they need them, that if they’re struggling with something they can go back and seek additional help so that they will get the best possible education they can. But that’s not the case right now. Many of the faculty, whether that’s at York University or whether that’s in our colleges, are piecing together a life because this Liberal government is underfunding the post-secondary education system. Many of the faculty in our post-secondary institutions are working multiple jobs just to try and make ends meet because they don’t have stable employment, thanks to this government.", "Another issue I’d like to bring up, because these people are indirectly employed by the government as well because the institution where they work receives funding from the government and the government receives revenue in return, are the people on strike at Caesars Windsor casino. It’s shameful that, as the employer, the government and the OLG—which is a body of the government—are making sure that the management team at the casino are still getting their revenues. They’re still getting paid; they’re not losing any money. The management company is getting exactly what they’re supposed to. Meanwhile, we have workers who have been out on the picket line for weeks now, and this government will not say to the management company to actually get back to the table.", "The government will say they respect collective bargaining, and that’s fantastic, but they know as well as I do that you can only have collective bargaining when both sides are at the table. Management is refusing to negotiate; they won’t even come to the table. They will not talk to the union about even setting dates to bargain. This is an institution that receives funding from the government.", "While they want to talk about government contract wages ensuring that people are compensated fairly and that nobody is getting left behind and we’re going to be transparent and all that kind of thing, that is not what they are doing. That is not the behaviour that they are exhibiting. They are allowing more and more people in this province who work in the public sector to struggle to find full-time jobs with fair wages.", "In Community Living—another example. In developmental services, you have organizations like Community Living, OASIS and Christian Horizons that provide supports to people with developmental disabilities; yet they can’t meet their pay equity obligations because this government hasn’t given them base funding increases in 10 years—10 years.", "What happens is, these workers are getting left behind. They are not receiving fair wages for the work that they do. They are not receiving full-time hours that they can count on, because these organizations that serve some of the most vulnerable people in this province aren’t receiving the funding from the government in order to be able to take care of their staff. While you have staff that are taking care of other people, they are not being taken care of by their employer, which essentially is this Liberal government.", "So it’s all good and well to talk about supporting government workers, supporting any worker in this province, but the record on the other side of the House, on the Liberal side, indicates that they really don’t support workers in this province; because if they did, they would be making sure that all of these organizations and institutions that are publicly funded are receiving adequate funding to do what it is that they need to do and that, ultimately, the employees there are making a decent living, where they can put a roof over their head, where they can feed their kids, where they might actually be able to afford their hydro bill.", "Speaking of hydro bills, the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke had talked about hydro. I think it’s really important to point out that it was actually the Conservatives that started us down the path of privatization when it comes to the hydro system. It was actually the Conservatives that started that process. That doesn’t excuse the fact that the Liberals then went off and charged ahead with selling off, when 80% of the people in this province did not support that—nor did they campaign on it last election, which they say they did." ],

I don’t know what it is that the Conservatives have against making sure that we have a healthy environment, that we have a sustainable environment. Where they get a little confused is in the role when it comes to supporting the Green Energy Act.", "Just to be clear, the NDP aren’t government—not yet. That will change June 7.

But if they want to talk about and sound like they are all for supportive housing, affordable housing and that kind of thing, investing in our public services, then they really need to be talking about what their record is and what they have actually done in the past.", "The other thing I want to point out is specifically related to government contract wages and talking about wages. The member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke also talked about the Pay Equity Commission. It’s important to point out, while he’s going after the Liberals about the Pay Equity Commission, that it was actually the Conservatives that cut the Pay Equity Commission by 50%. But again, the Conservatives don’t want to talk about their record. They don’t want to talk about their history. They just want to re-create history, I suppose.", "And then perhaps we could talk about Eleanor Clitheroe.

And then, Speaker, they want to stand up now and talk about CEO salaries and that kind of thing. Clearly, under the Liberals and their privatization of Hydro One, we now have Mayo Schmidt making over $6 million a year and saying he feels our pain when it comes to paying our hydro bills. I just want to point out that New Democrats have tabled legislation several times to cap CEO salaries, and neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives supported it. Not once. I believe this afternoon the PCs have a motion about the Hydro One board and their salaries. It’s interesting that they’ve had several opportunities to actually support legislation to cap CEO salaries, executive salaries, and they didn’t.", "Speaker, again, I’m not really sure the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke talked much about the actual bill, but he certainly gave me a lot of things to talk about.", "Another really important one, I think, to point out when we’re talking about the PC record and downloading and privatization is Walkerton, the privatization of the water testing in Walkerton.

They’re shutting off debate because they don’t want to hear from the constituents from the opposition side of the House. They don’t want to hear from their own constituents. They don’t want to have committee meetings and have stakeholders and others that are affected come in and talk about what may or may not work for them in the bill. They don’t want to do that. They want to shut down discussion and they want to rush through a bill.", "What that says to the people of this province is that the Liberals haven’t learned anything in 15 years about actually taking the people of this province seriously and listening to, and addressing, their concerns. It’s all about the Liberals; it’s all about the Liberal agenda: “What can we do to try and make us look good?” That’s rather unfortunate because there are 107 people, this session, who were elected to be here; 107 out of millions.

We have Ed Smith, who you all know; you probably all know now he was in the Supreme Court for a SLAPP suit by the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority. Judge Ramsay in the case ruled that the NPCA was wrong and that in fact as private citizens, we have the right to have a voice, to have an opinion, and there was no slander intended by Mr. Smith.

Lumb was the first Chinese Canadian to receive the Order of Canada.

We are extremely fortunate to enjoy the benefits of the different cultures and people that make up our province. I can step out in my community and be greeted by a chorus of voices speaking Mandarin, Urdu, Punjabi or Hindi. I can visit homes and be welcomed in to celebrations and occasions as though I were family. This is what diversity looks like and feels like, and we are so fortunate.", "In closing, I want to thank the Asian community for their immeasurable contributions to our province. Asian Canadians are leaders in our communities and volunteers who support important causes, and they are also our friends, co-workers and fellow Ontarians. Festivities to celebrate these important communities are taking place all across Ontario this month. I urge my colleagues and all Ontarians to join in. I welcome everyone across the province to celebrate Asian Heritage Month by talking to your neighbours, hosting an event, looking at the history and celebrating the present, for everyone in Ontario is a little richer because of their many contributions." ],

It came as a disgusting shock to most people in Ontario.", "Our leader, Doug Ford, has been discovering the same thing that we’ve been hearing for years at pre-budget hearings as Doug Ford criss-crosses the province. He’s been sitting down with young families, small business owners and seniors and asking them, “What’s the biggest thing the government could do to make your life easier?” The answer, Speaker, every single time is, “Clean up the Liberal hydro mess.”", "There are families being forced to choose between heating and eating, seniors who are afraid to turn their heaters on in the middle of winter, and long-time business owners who have been forced to close their doors and lay off staff who are like family to them—all of this because of skyrocketing hydro rates. Yet for weeks—for weeks, Speaker—the Premier and her ministers stood over there and defended the outrageous salaries at Hydro One. The CEO makes 10 times—10 times—what other CEOs make in other provinces, like Quebec, BC and Manitoba.", "Then we read on the front page of the Globe and Mail that in a secret, behind-closed-doors meeting, the board of Hydro One voted to increase the severance packages for the CEO and executives at Hydro One. This secret vote means that the CEO can now become the 10-million-dollar man. If the CEO and the board at Hydro One have any respect whatsoever for their customers, the families of Ontario, they would resign today.", "But wait, Speaker. Sensing that her political survival was at stake, suddenly the Premier does an about-face. Less than 24 hours before bringing this opposition day motion to the floor of the Legislature for a vote, we see a change. On the first day of the end of the winter hydro disconnection ban—that’s today, May 1. Let’s not forget that this government cut off 59,000 families from their power in the dead middle of a Canadian winter. Today is the day they can start that process all over again and cut families off from their hydro, as they generally do.", "But all of a sudden, the Premier, reading the political tea leaves, told the Hydro One board what Doug Ford has been calling for all along: that we need a lid on the fat-cat executive salaries. So, Speaker, this weak response from the Premier is only coming now because she and her millionaires’ club have been exposed just before the election.", "If this Liberal government truly—truly—had any respect whatsoever for Ontario families, the Premier would fire the six-million-dollar man and the entire board of Hydro One. She has told this Legislature that she has the authority to do that. Now, of course, she changed her opinion. For all of last week, she said they don’t; and now, again, they apparently do. We’re back to her original story that she has the authority, even though she said, “We don’t somehow.”", "Instead, she and her ministers have stood on that side of the floor, defending their insider friends, justifying these outrageous salaries and continuing to have them line their pockets. After weeks of PC leader Doug Ford sounding the siren call against the outrageous executive compensation at Hydro One, it is wonderful, Speaker, to see that the Premier and their government are now following Doug Ford’s lead.", "The government should have no problem supporting this motion. They should have had no problem doing the right thing a long time ago and capping executive compensation at Hydro One.", "But I think Ontarians have come to the conclusion that we can do better. After weeks of PC leader Doug Ford sounding the siren call against this outrageous compensation, we now have the government following our leader’s lead.

A headline from April 12: “PC Leader Doug Ford Vows to Fire Hydro One CEO, Board If Elected.” He said he would fire them if he was elected Premier in June.

I certainly agreed that the salary is outrageous. I just happened to think that as long as you have a privatized utility, you’re going to have another six-million-dollar man, a six-million-dollar woman, and then another six-million-dollar man.", "The reality is, if you don’t take on privatization, you’re setting the stage for much higher bills in years to come. That’s what’s going to happen. This party, the Conservatives, and that party, the Liberals, have no interest in returning these assets to public hands. They’re happy to have them privatized.

They talked about the very obvious realities, but they also noted that they have their fair hydro plan in place.", "As was said to some reporters, the government has committed to keep rate increases to below inflation for the next four years. If you borrow 40 billion bucks, you can do a lot, right? Let’s face it: If you’ve got $40 billion on the table, you can probably reduce prices. But then they noted that “bills will rise significantly in the decade that follows.” So, in fact, what the Liberals have set up is a trap that they’ve pushed the people of Ontario into, and getting out of that trap is going to cost us $40 billion—a lot of money that could put a lot of hospitals in place and a lot of child care centres in place. It could make a real difference in our lives.", "I have to finish off with a quote from Mr. Ford in that same Star article that I have been noting: “‘The party’s over with the taxpayers’ money, we’re going to start respecting the taxpayers,’ Ford said, repeatedly saying the money spent on Hydro One salaries is ‘morally indefensible.’”", "So, what did Doug Ford do when he was on the executive committee of Toronto city council? Was he the man who stood up for the people? Was he the man who took the fat cats and brought them to heel? Or, in fact, was he an enabler? Was he the man who helped the CEO, Anthony Haines, become the million-dollar-man at Toronto Hydro? Indeed, he was. Oh, yes.", "A certain Tom Adams, an energy analyst, someone who has been hired by the Conservatives in the past to do energy policy for them, wrote an article in 2013. The title was “Ontario Electricity Regulation Crisis Report Part 95: Ford Brothers Enabling Toronto Hydro’s Gravy Train.” Who knew? Doug Ford, the defender of the taxpayer and the ratepayer: just like a Liberal, happy to make a rich man richer every day.", "As Mr. Adams wrote, “With the Fords’ enablement, Toronto Hydro’s gravy train is picking up speed. Since the Fords gained power in 2010, compensation for Anthony Haines, Toronto Hydro’s CEO, has jumped 32%.” My goodness. Who would have allowed that? “Haines is on pace to haul in more than $1 million this year before considering any special pension bonuses or retirement allowances.", "“Including his $330K special retirement allowance gain last year, Haines took home” almost seven times “the average pay of other municipal workers in equivalent positions of responsibility at the five largest municipal water utilities in Ontario—positions at least as challenging as running a power distributor.”", "So I say this to Mayo Schmidt: I wouldn’t worry about Mr. Ford, because he’s going to be your best buddy. He’s your kind of guy. He knows what it’s like to have to work hard to bring in a $6-million salary, and he’s going to make sure that you continue on, that you do well.", "In fact, when you look at voting records, Doug Ford as a councillor, a member of the executive committee, was one of the leading members of council ensuring that Anthony Haines stayed on in his million-dollar-a-year position. He was the guy who stood up for the million-dollar man. In fact, when there were allegations about perjury on the part of Anthony Haines, Doug Ford responded to commentary that in fact, “Anthony’s a good guy.”", "Now, I have to say the OEB, which I continue to think of as a glove puppet, wouldn’t respond to evidence presented to them about this allegation of perjury. They would not investigate. I think that speaks to the lack of independence, the lack of a regulatory will, on the part of the OEB. I don’t know whether those allegations are true or false. What I do know is that something substantial like that should have been investigated. It was not. It’s consistent with what the Liberals have done in this province to make sure that the OEB is tamed.", "Did Doug Ford stand up for Canadian jobs or for protecting ratepayers? I know that question hangs in the air. Many are curious as to the answer. Well, in fact, there were votes taken to ask for two reports, one of which was to instruct the city manager to request that Toronto Hydro Corp. report on the recently reported contracting of services, such as mapping and accounts payable, to the US and India. Did he stand against contracting out, off-shoring Canadian jobs?", "City council also asked Toronto Hydro Corp. to consider adopting whistle-blower protection policies. Clearly, you need to have protection for whistle-blowers so that if things are going wrong, the word can get out to the public.", "I can tell you that those resolutions were carried, but there was a strong vote against, and that was Mr. Doug Ford." ],

Our government remains committed to Hydro One’s regulation, accountability and transparency through our government’s involvement as the company’s largest shareholder. That’s why, this weekend, we took action.", "On Sunday, our government, as the largest shareholder, urged Hydro One’s board to revisit its executive compensation model. For members of the Legislature’s background, on March 29, Hydro One released its annual management information circular. At that time, we learned about the changes in executive pay, the incentives and the severance packages. As the company’s largest shareholder, our government engaged in careful and necessary analysis and determined that these changes were unjustifiably generous. It was for this reason that we urged the board to revisit its compensation model.", "Yesterday, the board released a statement in which they communicated that they had heard us loud and clear. Their statement read, “Hydro One has decided to conduct supplementary shareholder engagement and obtain additional independent advice” on their compensation model. This will assist the company “in seeking the direct input of shareholders on matters related to executive compensation, inclusive of change of control and severance provisions.” Finally, they have undertaken to review their current practices in light of the input that they have received.", "While Doug Ford would take an erratic and reckless approach and fire Hydro One’s board—which would do absolutely nothing to reduce customers’ rates but would almost certainly risk the market value of Hydro One upon which so many people rely—we believe in a stable solution that exercises our authority as the largest shareholder.", "With this in mind, our government will be voting against this opposition day motion.", "Additionally, the government will abstain from voting on the say-on-pay shareholder resolution at the Hydro One annual general meeting on May 15. That is to give the board the necessary time to re-examine this matter.", "Our government continues, though, to focus on fairness. We’re urging the board to do the same when designing an executive compensation program that is fair for the people of Ontario, Hydro One’s 1.3 million customers and, as well, its shareholders.", "Now, the plan coming forward from the official opposition is really like letting a bull run through a china shop, and I said that earlier, Mr. Speaker. They want to fire the board of a publicly traded company, not a government entity. This is incredibly irresponsible. It’s up to the Leader of the Opposition, Doug Ford, to explain how this would actually work.", "The gimmick that Mr. Ford is talking about will really do a couple of things: It will drag us down into the same mess that we’re seeing in the United States and won’t actually do anything to reduce hydro bills. As the member from Prince Edward–Hastings would say, the Ford scheme is chaotic and out of control.", "Instead, our government has taken a reasonable and responsible approach. This weekend, as I said, our government urged Hydro One to revisit its executive compensation model. The background that I want to provide is talking about how that management information circular became available to us on March 29. It was at that time when we learned of the changes to that package. All of this being said, we really are working towards a stable solution that exercises our authority as the largest shareholder. Instead of firing people left and right, much like what they would do with teachers and nurses with their across-the-board cuts to government services, our government believes in that responsible and stable approach.", "I know the honourable member from Toronto–Danforth talked earlier about the Ontario Energy Board, our independent regulator, which I know does a good job within the province. The way rates are set in this province is through the Ontario Energy Board. There has been some discussion on the impact of Hydro One’s executive compensation on electricity rates in this province. First of all, it’s important to make one thing very clear, and I know Mr. Ford and the opposition know this very well—and they do, Mr. Speaker. Electricity rates in Ontario are always set by the independent Ontario Energy Board. So firing the executive leadership or the board of Hydro One does not change this process. The Ontario Energy Board does not allow distributors to simply increase profit margins.", "Let’s look at a pertinent example of this. Last fall, the Ontario Energy Board capped the portion of executive compensation Hydro One electricity customers are required to fund at 10% of base salaries, saving ratepayers $30 million over this year and next. The Ontario Energy Board also ensures that when companies improve their processes, the benefit is passed on to the consumer. So for those not familiar with the board, Mr. Speaker, this quasi-judicial body has demonstrated time and again its commitment to putting consumers first.", "There are many examples here, Mr. Speaker. In 2010, Hydro One asked for a rate increase for distribution and received a 9% reduction of its capital request. In 2012, Hydro One asked for a rate increase for transmission and received a 3% reduction of its capital request. In 2011, Ontario Power Generation applied for a 6.2% increase, and the Ontario Energy Board denied their request and lowered rates by 0.8%. Three years later, OPG asked for a rate increase, and the board approved about half the requested amount. In 2011, Toronto Hydro made a distribution request to the board and received 10.8% less than requested.", "The Ontario Energy Board’s mandate is to protect the interests of ratepayers and to set just and reasonable rates, and they will continue to do so regardless of the ownership of Hydro One. Unlike what the opposition has said, Hydro One rates haven’t skyrocketed, and that’s because the independent Ontario Energy Board, our province’s energy regulator, sets those rates for Hydro One. Hydro One does not get to set those rates themselves. This didn’t change when Hydro One became a private company.", "I’d like to talk a little bit about what has happened since Hydro One has become a private company. Since we broadened the ownership of Hydro One, Mr. Speaker, they have become a more customer-focused company. One of the province’s objectives in broadening the ownership was exactly this: to promote improved corporate performance, including customer service.", "Under new management, Hydro One is improving on a number of service metrics. First, Hydro One has indicated that it has improved the quality of their call centre interactions through improved training, staffing and performance management. Customer satisfaction with the call centre has improved from 77% to 90% since October 2014.", "In 2015, Hydro One became the first electrical utility in Canada to launch a customer service guarantee, offering a $50 credit to customers who do not receive prompt service. Hydro One has also taken steps to improve billing performance, and reports confirm that 99% of bills issued to time-of-use customers are based on actual meter reads, up from 92% in December 2014, and above the industry standard.", "They introduced the winter relief program to reconnect residential customers who were without electrical service in the winter, before our government introduced legislation to ban this practice. Additionally, they eliminated residential security deposits and doubled their funding to the United Way’s low-income energy assistance program for vulnerable customers. They are now also administering the $100-million affordability fund created by our government to help lower-income customers make their homes even more energy-efficient and thereby reduce their bills even further.", "Since broadening ownership, they have also been working to cut costs by tens of millions of dollars. All told, the leadership has found $114 million in savings, and these are savings that ensure that bills do not go up for Hydro One customers. This is being done through rethinking and negotiating contracts with third-party suppliers and improving their paperless billing solution, just to name a few of those options.", "Our government remains committed to Hydro One’s continued regulation, accountability and transparency. Let me reiterate this, Mr. Speaker: Since we broadened the ownership of the company, they have become a better-run company. They have found that $114 million in savings. They have moved forward voluntarily to end winter disconnections and have increased their customer service. Do you know what else? Due to this, the calls to their customer service offices have dropped significantly, meaning more money can be saved.", "Hydro One now acknowledges that its largest shareholder should be engaged on such issues as executive compensation and severance, and that those changes were and are necessary. We look forward to continuing to engage with the Hydro One board and their leadership in a responsible and stable manner. This is unlike what we’re hearing from the opposition, who have said they would just fire the board. We will continue to believe in this stable solution that exercises our authority as the largest shareholder. That is, again, why we’re voting against today’s opposition day motion.", "Our government has also made significant investments—and it’s important for me to talk about this, Mr. Speaker—in our electricity system. We completely eliminated dirty coal-fired generation and the smog days that came with it. This remains the single largest climate change initiative in North America.", "We invested $35 billion in new and refurbished generation, meaning 16,000 megawatts of clean, renewable, reliable power, and we invested more than $15 billion in upgrading more than 15,000 kilometres of transmission and distribution lines—more than twice the distance from Montreal to Vancouver, for example. We kick-started a renewable energy sector that has brought thousands of jobs and major investments into our great province. In short, we modernized an electricity system that needed to be fixed to ensure Ontarians have the power when they need it, Mr. Speaker, and, of course, reliable and affordable.", "We know that these investments have put cost pressures on families. That’s why our government is making it clear that affordable access to our clean, reliable electricity system is a top priority, and that’s why, last year, our government introduced the fair hydro plan, which lowered electricity bills by an average of 25% for all residential customers and as many as 500,000 small businesses and farms. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, any rate increases will be held to the rate of inflation for four years.", "Ontario families and small businesses are now paying less on average here than in many other similar jurisdictions. Families in cities like New York, Boston and San Francisco pay more than double the average Ontario bill. Residents in other US cities like Detroit, Chicago, Nashville, Seattle and Miami pay more than we do as well. The difference isn’t limited to US cities, either. Families in Charlottetown, Regina, Halifax and Moncton are paying more than the Ontario average as well. And that doesn’t even include savings from the expanded Ontario Electricity Support Program for low-income customers, who will now be receiving more credits on their bills.", "The fair hydro plan includes relief for those with the highest distribution rates through the Rural and Remote Rate Protection Program, Mr. Speaker. This means that some customers may see their bills lowered by as much as 40% to 50%. And the new $100-million Affordability Fund administered by Hydro One also provides low-income consumers with energy-efficient retrofits that will lower their bills even more.", "Finally, we moved forward with a First Nations Delivery Credit, which completely eliminated the delivery charge for First Nations who live on-reserve, which averages out to a monthly savings of about $85.", "That’s real action for Ontario families, ensuring they have access to a fairer and better electricity system.", "Let’s take a look at what the opposition parties have done. The PCs voted against the plan when it mattered most, and now have come forward and have seemed to support it. I know, after months of denouncing the fair hydro plan, just last week the leader of the official opposition, the PC Party, Mr. Ford, announced his intention to embrace the plan as the foundation of his own electricity plan. So their party leader endorsed our plan by retaining all aspects of the fair hydro plan, which reduces electricity rates by 25%, on average, for Ontario families and businesses and up to 40% to 50% in remote and rural areas.", "Unfortunately, it’s everything else that Mr. Ford has proposed that fails to pass the smell test, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Ford’s plans don’t add up to anything but empty promises that will eventually dig their way into people’s pocketbooks.", "First, the cornerstone commitment to abandon all new contracted electricity procurement projects fails to mention there are no new contracted electricity procurement projects. As a consequence, there can’t be savings to pass on to customers.", "Worse than that, Mr. Speaker, by bragging that he’ll tear up committed capacity contracts, he’s inviting massive lawsuits that will cost the province hundreds of millions of dollars and, in turn, drive electricity costs back up. This undeniable fact has been acknowledged by Ford’s own caucus member and energy critic, who said, on radio, that this would come at a huge cost to taxpayers and we’re going to see electricity prices continue to rise—comments from his own energy critic, Mr. Speaker.", "Unlike their half-baked scheme, Ontarians know we have a plan to increase fairness and create more opportunity. They know our fair hydro plan actually lowers bills by 25%, on average, and then holds rates to the cost of inflation for the next four years. This is a real plan that makes the cost of electricity more fair for families.", "The NDP also voted against the fair hydro plan and have no realistic plan as to how they will replace it. They want to spend at least $9 billion buying back Hydro One shares, which won’t take one cent off of anyone’s bills. So what they want to do is raise electricity prices by 25%. They want to get rid of the fair hydro plan, which will then raise rates by 25%, and then try to figure out a way to get it down to 30%. There’s no way that they can do this. They are actually trying to say they want to be able to work with the federal government to see if there’s a way they can get the federal government to take the HST off of the bills. That’s part of their solution. Obviously, they don’t have a real plan or a realistic plan to lower bills. We’ve brought forward a plan that has lowered bills by 25%, Mr. Speaker, and do you know what? We’ll continue to keep this plan in place to continue to help people right across the province.", "Our plan provides needed assistance to families and businesses and it targets support to those who need it most. We’re doing this because we have a plan to support care, create opportunity and make life more affordable during this period of rapid economic change.", "As I was saying earlier, we brought forward the fair hydro plan. We continue to work with Hydro One, their executives, and their board to continue to keep our system clean, to keep our system reliable and to keep our system as affordable as possible.", "Mr. Speaker, I look forward to further being a part of this debate as we carry on this afternoon." ],

I don’t know exactly what happened, Mr. Speaker, but probably a poll moved them to move on this issue.", "We do know a lot of things: There is a six-million-dollar man there at Hydro One—a $6.2-million man, as a matter of fact: 10 times his peers’ in other jurisdictions across Canada. His salary is 10 times his peer’s at Hydro-Québec, where the price of electricity is a third of what it is here in Ontario. Think about that for a second. The CEO at Hydro-Québec is responsible not just for the transmission; he is responsible for the generation as well. He has a lot more responsibility. He’s making one tenth of the salary of the CEO at Hydro One, and their price is a third—a third—of what it is here in Ontario.", "It was really interesting to hear the Minister of Energy talk about the fact that Ontario has hydro prices that are less than those in a number of jurisdictions in Canada and the United States, but—" ],

Now, the removal of the six-million-dollar man should send a message to the board at Hydro One, because the Ontario Energy Board’s decision hadn’t moved them to take any action. The Ontario Energy Board actually told them that: “Your administrative package is $30 million higher than it should have been.” What did Hydro One do? They went, hat in hand, to the Ontario Energy Board, looking for a rate increase, and the OEB said, “No. Get out of here. Get out of here until you deal with your executive compensation and your administration.” The cost of the administrative package at Hydro One: $412 million.", "And keep in mind, we only know now the salaries of the top five executives at Hydro One. The only reason we know that is because of Ontario securities law that requires publicly traded companies to show us the salaries of the top five executives. But how big is that millionaires’ club at Hydro One? We don’t know because since the government sold off Hydro One, against the wishes of the people of Ontario, we don’t get to see that sunshine list any longer. We don’t get to see how big the millionaires’ club is at Hydro One.", "You know, it was interesting, too, that over the course of the last three years, since the government decided that they were going to make a decision against their promises in the last election campaign—which speaks to the fact we can’t trust them again going into this election campaign. They weren’t going to sell Hydro One. The first thing they did was, they sold Hydro One; then they fundraised off the sale of Hydro One, off the initial public offering. That’s what they did. That’s why they got caught, because of the sale of the Hydro One IPO.", "But the Premier said, “Don’t worry. Don’t worry. We’re going to maintain control because we’re going to be the biggest shareholder. We’re going to be the biggest shareholder, so we’ll be able to remove the board and remove the CEO.” That was Premier Wynne who said that on many, many occasions here in this House.

Every time the government says they’re going to roll out hundreds of millions of dollars but the money never makes it to the front-line workers, it ends up in bureaucracy. This is going to be a message to all of those fat-cat bureaucrats that the party with the taxpayers’ money is over. We’re not going to stand for it.

  "text" : [ "Afternoon, Speaker. Three weeks ago, there was breaking news from the soon-to-be official campaign trail, a news bulletin, an announcer rushing into the studio, out of breath: “This just in.” The earth stood still. We waited anxiously. The Tories held their breath: “Oh, God, what has Doug Ford done now? What’s he done? What’s Doug Ford said now? What? He says he’ll fire the head of Hydro One?”", "Speaker, there were a few puzzled looks and more than a few eyebrows raised. Someone said, “Doesn’t he know that it’s now a private company?” Someone else weighed in: “Wouldn’t the six-million-dollar man have a golden parachute worth at least twice that much money, or close to it? What will it cost to get rid of him?”", "We waited, puzzled, and then a new voice: “Doug doesn’t care about the cost. He’s sending a message. He’s going to stop the gravy train. It worked for Rob. Doug wants to try it out. He thinks it will work for him.”", "After all, Speaker, a bull in a china shop doesn’t worry about the destruction and the cost of cleaning it up. I’m just guessing about that, of course; I’ve never met a bull up close and personal until now. I have heard the new leader of the Conservatives say he’ll leave no stone unturned when it comes to making cuts and finding savings should he ever take over the reins of power. I believe he said he would have no trouble finding savings amounting to 4% of the total provincial budget.", "Each ministry has its own budget. Many of them have fixed costs. Salaries and benefits take up about 75% of these ministries. If you do the math, if you’re going to cut 4% of the budget, you’re going to have to cut jobs. You’re going to lay off teachers, nurses. Yet, on the campaign trail, we hear the Conservatives say there will be no job loss. They’re still reeling from the last election when Tim Hudak said, just days after the campaign began, he was going to cut 100,000 jobs. The Conservatives lost that election and it was because of that promise. There’s no denying that. “So this time, we’ll cut 4% but we’ll pretend it won’t end up in one job being cut.”", "Hard to believe? Very hard to believe? Who do we trust? That’s what this election will come down to: trust, credibility and a vision for the future. Who do we believe? Who do we trust to do what they say they’ll do, and what are the hidden costs of these promises?" ],

Now we hear the new leader of the Conservative Party likes the plan so much he has no plans to change it. He has no vision, no plan to lower hydro rates to end time-of-day pricing, to get the system back into public hands. He’s right about just one thing: One of the reasons the rates are so high—really high—is because we pay hydro executives in this private company too much money. But the rates won’t go down if you replace Liberal appointees on that board with Conservative appointees on that board. Doug—Mr. Ford—get those shares back into public hands.", "Even the Liberals finally—the penny has dropped. The gravy train thing clicked. We saw today that after ignoring the calls about high salaries and severance packages for weeks, the Liberals are now trying to save face with the electorate and are asking Hydro to take a look at their salaries, urging them to take a look at their salaries and their severance packages—urging them. As the former member for Trinity–Spadina, Mr. Marchese, would say, God bless. Maybe we’ll even see some of the Liberals support this opposition bill today. Who knows, with the Liberals, Speaker?", "But Doug Ford has one change he wants to make. He’ll put an end to the way political parties are now funded in Ontario. Right now, we can’t take donations from corporations and unions. Instead, we get an allowance based on previous vote totals.

He’s turning back the clock. And now, video evidence has surfaced of Doug Ford promising developers he’ll pave over part of the greenbelt and open it up for development: big chunks of the greenbelt up for grabs in a secret deal with Canada’s biggest developers. Domestic and foreign investors are being encouraged to build on environmentally sensitive wetlands.", "This is not the party of Bill Davis. This Conservative leader has no shame. He’s a bulldozer waiting to happen, developing big chunks of the environmentally sensitive greenbelt.", "I hear the Facebook and Twitter crowd are already attacking some of the Conservative candidates over this blunder, and for that I say, God bless. There should be no tolerance for secret deals with developers chomping at the bit to tear up the greenbelt, one big chunk at a time. This could very well turn into an Achilles heel for the catch-me-if-you-can Conservative campaign. I certainly hope so.", "Their leader holding secret talks with the bagmen, the developers, the home builders, the ones who will be making big political donations, again, to any party that does their bidding—we just got away from that, and now it’s a slippery slope back down to the shady, sleazy side of political fundraising. I never thought I’d see the day—back to the days of catering to your donors instead of bringing in sound legislation that benefits everyone in the province, paving over paradise to put up a parking lot and a few thousand four-level backsplits. The greenbelt is not the reason why there’s a shortage of homes in the GTHA. Developers see it as an easy way to make money as opposed to in-filling on available space already spread throughout the area.", "Trust, credibility and a vision for the future are three pillars of any election campaign.", "It’s one thing, for example, to bring in a budget. You can grab a headline when that budget contains, say, coverage for a dental program. We just saw that with the Liberals.", "I found it hilarious, the very next day in question period, when time and time again the leader of my party asked the Minister of Finance very simple questions—did he know the cost of having your teeth cleaned; did he know the cost of having a cavity filled; did he know the cost of having a tooth pulled or the cost of having an impacted tooth removed or the cost of a root canal? Oh, Speaker, what an example of being hoisted on his own petard. The minister could read a budget speech, but he had absolutely no idea what it costs for dental work, even though he had small sums of money included in the budget for dental coverage. What a day.", "Yet we have the leader of the Conservative Party making statements—promises—of what he’ll do, without any idea of the financial consequences of his promises. It’s a scary thing, Speaker.", "In this era, supposedly, of open government and transparency, we have the leader of the Conservative Party playing a peekaboo campaign with the media. He’ll have no media bus following him around the province—no, not allowed. He doesn’t want to be held accountable for what he says to a select audience in one town while perhaps saying the opposite while catering to opposite views in another municipality.", "The Liberals are running on their budget. We in the NDP have costed out our platform, and it’s out there for public scrutiny. And we have the duck-and-cover, peekaboo, catch-me-if-you-can campaign of Doug Ford and the Conservatives.", "Well, he has been caught on camera promising to carve up the greenbelt into big housing chunks for his developer buddies.

Indeed, it was considered the unloved and unwanted problem creature of this province, subject to scorn and micromanagement from the floor of the Legislature, and was the one on which the opposition parties carped at the government most continuously.", "I would ask them, then, what exactly is Hydro One? Most of them will just sort of stop and say, “Um.” Their first reflex will be that it’s an electrical utility. And is it really? What is Hydro One? Hydro One is a transportation company. It doesn’t make what it carries. It doesn’t consume what it carries. It carries a commodity product—electricity—on a dedicated roadway—wires—and in its own way is very much like a railway that will carry freight on designated railways between its origin and its destination. Hydro One carries electricity from the producer, from the manufacturer, and hands it off to a distributor. That’s all Hydro One is: Hydro One is a common carrier; Hydro One is, if you wish, a trucking company.", "The motion before us asks us to put into perspective what the CEO of a common carrier that hauls electricity is in relation to—and they have used other electrical utilities that are all public utilities. Let’s have a look at some of the salaries and total compensation paid to CEOs who are in the transportation business. Let’s have a look at Calin Rovinescu, the president and CEO of Air Canada. He makes a base salary of $1.4 million, very comparable to what Mayo Schmidt makes. But his total compensation, should he hit his targets—just as Mayo Schmidt does not get his bonuses unless he hits his targets. Mr. Rovinescu’s targets are $9 million.", "Looking in the power business, Paul Desmarais Jr., the chairman and CEO of Power Corp. of Canada—his total compensation is about $6.77 million; André Desmarais, the deputy chair and co-CEO of Power Corp., $6.875 million.", "In the transportation sector, looking at Luc Jobin, who is the president and CEO of Canadian National Railway—he will bring in $8.3 million. Hunter Harrison, during the time that he was still the CEO of Canadian Pacific Railway, brought in $18.8 million. And those are just in Canada.", "Just to put that into a little bit of perspective, looking at William Johnson, who in 2017, as the president and CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority—and TVA is a utility very comparable to Ontario here. TVA paid its president and CEO, with bonuses, in American funds, $6.68 million. Looking at Ameren Corp., which operates out of Missouri and Illinois, much smaller than Ontario, their chairman, president and CEO was paid $8 million. Alliant Energy in Wisconsin, Patricia Kampling—her total pay package: $6.5 million.", "Now, Speaker, I can go on because I have dozens of these. But the point of it all is not that it isn’t a lot of money; it is. It’s a lot of money. But in the context of that industry, they’re not paying their CEO anything out of the ordinary.", "Here’s the difference, however. On the opposition side, what they want to do is to, in essence, go after the board and take out a contract on the career of the president and CEO and rub out his career, which I think reflects a great lack of maturity.", "On the government side, we have said, “Wait a minute. We’re the controlling shareholder here.” Having found out about this particular pay package, we have said to the board of Hydro One, “We want you to review this. We want you to come back and tell us whether you think that this is justified in the circumstances.”", "Now, I think one of the best indicators of future behaviour has always been past behaviour; and while on their watch, in their last interminable eight years of government, the old Ontario Hydro was a repository for Conservative hacks. Look at some of the outfall of that. One of the things that Ontarians inherited while the Conservatives, on their last sad, sorry watch in government, ran the electricity sector—or more appropriately, ran it into the ground—was that they were left more than $20 billion of hydro debt.", "Now, what’s happened in those intervening years? Liberals, being Liberals, looked at that debt and dealt with it the old-fashioned way. We paid it. You no longer have that albatross of a hydro debt on your electricity bill. It’s paid. It was Conservative debt. It was paid by Liberals.", "In the case of Hydro One, as its largest shareholder, Ontario does have leverage over that board, and in this case an activist owner does make a difference.", "Now, let’s go back to talking about the analogy of Hydro One as a common carrier. Do you think, Speaker, that a common carrier such as CN Rail sets or affects the price of a barrel of oil that it may carry, a bushel of wheat, a tonne of cargo? It doesn’t. Those prices are set between the producer and the distributor and set at the ability of the consumer.", "While the Conservative approach continues to be as reckless as it always has been with anything to do with electricity, if what they plan to do is to eradicate the entire board, get rid of the CEO, they very clearly send a signal that they would go back to appointing Conservative political cronies who, the last time around, ran the organization into the ground.", "I’d like to quote, with regard to the impact of the salary of Mayo Schmidt, whom I’ve met—Mayo Schmidt played for a few years on the Miami Dolphins in the National Football League; he ran the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. He’s a good guy.", "Now, here’s what David Denison, who is the chairman of the board of Hydro One, had to say, and I’m going to use his words exactly. He published them in the Globe and Mail just last week. He said:", "“Hydro One had previously capped the amount of executive compensation that is funded by our customers through the rate they pay at an amount equivalent to the level of compensation prior to our initial public offering of shares. Consequently, any additional compensation paid to Hydro One executives after it ceased to be a Crown corporation, including increases granted to Mr. Schmidt or other executives in 2017, have absolutely no impact on the rates our customers are charged. Likewise, should circumstances arise where change-of-control payments are triggered, those payments would also have absolutely no impact on customer bills.”", "Hence the entire premise of this opposition day motion is nonsense.", "But let’s talk about some of the things that the current Hydro board—which began life as the unloved creature of this particular Legislature and was then spun off and is now, by any standards, a well-run private sector corporation with a controlling interest held by the government of Ontario. Since going public, Hydro One has achieved $114 million in cost savings, all of which flow back to their customers. They have fixed some of the chronic billing issues, which were the subject of discussion right here on this floor in this Legislature just a few years back, that had long plagued Hydro One and among its customers achieved a 99.3% accuracy level in its billing. They’ve become the first electricity provider in Ontario to not only suspend customer disconnections in winter months but to voluntarily reconnect customers so no one would be without power during bad weather periods.", "There was a suggestion that Hydro One’s operations would somehow or other leave out their employees, leave out the people in the community. Well, they actually brought 400 call centre employees in-house, back under the roof, in two locations across Ontario and opened the phone lines to serve customers on Saturdays. As a result, Hydro One is finding that it has some of its highest customer satisfaction levels in years.", "My colleague in Prince Edward–Hastings commented on something that his leader said, and I’m going to grant him the courtesy of saying that on that occasion perhaps his rhetoric ran ahead of where his mind might have been. We’re not going to dwell on that again. I think we have made our point there.", "Let us talk again about how rates aren’t set. If rates are not set by the carrier of freight, then who are rates set by? Rates are set by the Ontario Energy Board. When one has a monopoly or an oligopoly, the way to substitute for what would otherwise be free market competition would be a board or regulatory agency. This is very common in electricity. In fact, it’s more the norm than the exception. In the United States they call them “public utility commissions”; here in Ontario we call it the “Ontario Energy Board.”", "Just in the recent past, in 2012, Hydro One asked for a rate increase for transmission. The Ontario Energy Board looked very carefully at it and said, “Actually, I think what we really should do is have a 3% rate reduction” for its capital request.", "In 2011, Ontario Power Generation applied for a 6.2% rate increase. The Ontario Energy Board denied the request and lowered rates by 0.8%.", "In 2011, Toronto Hydro made a distribution request to the board and received 10.8% less than they requested.", "In Ontario, we have an entity called the Ontario Energy Board. Its mandate is to protect the interests of ratepayers. It’s an independent board. Elected officials have no influence on it at all. Its task is to set just, fair, reasonable and transparent rates, and it will continue to do so, regardless of how the ownership of Hydro One is structured. So Hydro One does not—does not—get to set electricity rates.", "We have also seen that the executive compensation package of its management team does not, in any way, impact the rates that you pay on your bill, which, again, reduces the essence of this opposition day motion to completely empty rhetoric. That’s why the government will vote against it.", "What was some of the thinking in broadening the ownership of Hydro One? What it did was to generate $9 billion of share sales sold into a sellers’ market at the high end of the price range—$9 billion that, in our area in Mississauga, means money to improve transit. Some of that money will go to paying for the light rail link that will go straight north from Lakeshore up to Hurontario. God willing, if CP Rail can come to the table and have a meaningful discussion with Metrolinx, perhaps some of that money will be spent improving the track bed on the Milton line so that in our neighbourhoods of Lisgar, Meadowvale, Streetsville, Erindale and Cooksville, we can have all-day, two-way GO train service.", "I would add, very briefly, that we have excellent bus service with plenty of capacity, so if you’ve got to get back and forth in the middle of the day, you’re going to be able to do it from the same stations.", "That’s the impact of having recovered some value from an entity that the province of Ontario continues to control, and that’s Hydro One, the transportation entity that carries electricity from the entities that produce it—Bruce Power, OPG and all of the other power generators across Ontario—to the people who distribute it, some of which is distributed by Hydro One, some by Alectra, and more by Toronto Hydro. Those three distribution companies, by the way, make up more than 80% of Ontario’s distribution. There are another 62 smaller distribution companies, if I remember correctly, throughout the province, all of whom receive the power that they distribute to their local communities from Hydro One. But Hydro One merely carries it; it neither produces it, nor consumes it. It carries it from the generators to the distribution companies.", "Hydro One continues to improve. It was the first electrical utility in Canada to launch a customer service guarantee. It offers a $50 credit to customers who do not receive prompt service. I mentioned earlier that Hydro One has taken steps to improve its billing performance, and reports confirm that 99% of bills issued to time-of-use customers are based on actual meter reads, up from 92% in 2014 and well above the industry standards.", "Yes, Mayo Schmidt is paid a lot of money. However, if Mayo Schmidt hadn’t made a difference, that would be a different conversation. In this case, the executive whose pay they are calling into question—about which the province has said to Hydro One, “We want you to review this”—is an individual who put together a management team that has made a difference. They’ve eliminated residential security deposits. They’ve doubled their funding to the United Way’s Low-Income Energy Assistance Program for vulnerable customers. They’re administering the $100-million Affordability Fund created by the province to help lower-income customers make their homes more energy efficient, and they have cut costs by $114 million.", "Speaker, this opposition day motion is baseless. It doesn’t deserve to pass. Thank you for an opportunity to, I hope, have an adult discussion about it." ],

Of course, yesterday we find out that they’re taking a different position, because Doug Ford has backed them into a corner on this one.", "But then today, the member for Mississauga–Streetsville was going on and on almost justifying what Mayo Schmidt makes. To my point, as my colleague from Prince Edward–Hastings so ably pointed out, the member from Mississauga–Streetsville is comparing Mayo Schmidt to all kinds of different people who don’t work in the energy sector. The best ones to compare are not Air Canada and CP Rail; the best ones to compare would be the other hydro-electric utilities in Canada, like Hydro-Québec and Manitoba Hydro, of which Mayo Schmidt makes more than 10 times their salary.", "But the member from Mississauga–Streetsville generally tries to justify any mistakes that the Liberals have made.

But they may not get the chance to actually manifest their dissatisfaction with that decision until June 7, because that’s the opportunity that people have to give a yay or a nay, a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down, to the government that they’ve been living with for the past 15 years.", "We believe on this side of the House that if you own 47% of a corporation, then you are part of the decision-making process and part of the decisions made by that board. When they stood in the House here and tried to deflect that issue and say, “Well, those are decisions of the board”—you control the board.", "How many times did we hear in this Legislature directly from the lips of the Premier that she retains the power to dismiss the board at Hydro One? We heard that every day under questioning, because we were questioning her on why they were selling the shares of Hydro One even though 80% of the people were opposed to the sale of Hydro One.", "What separates the Liberals from our leader, Doug Ford, is that when they have their favourites—and there are people who are going to benefit greatly from the sale of Hydro One—they don’t care what the people say. But when Doug Ford hears from the people, because Doug Ford is for the people, Doug Ford stands up and says, “I hear you and I’m listening.” I want to unequivocally say that the greenbelt in Ontario will remain untouched under a Doug Ford Progressive Conservative government because we believe in the people, we are for the people and we represent the people." ],

As you know, you called me the member for Nepean–Carleton. In just five short weeks, I will no longer be the member from Carleton. God willing, I will still be the member for Nepean as my riding splits in three. The Carleton part of my riding is on Hydro One; the Nepean part of my riding is on Ottawa Hydro. So, if I may, in the next four or five minutes that I have, speak about the people of Carleton in the context of the challenges they’ve had as a result of Hydro One.", "But first and foremost, let me say this to the people of Carleton who have, for four elections in 12 years, put their trust in me to stand in this place on behalf of them at the Legislature: My family, Joe, Victoria and I, will always be indebted to them for giving me the opportunity to rise to the occasion in this House so many times. I believe this will be my last speech in this House before the election, so I think it is incumbent upon me, on behalf of my family, to say thank you to the residents of Carleton for that fellowship they have given me and the love and care.", "They’ve watched me grow up. They’ve watched my daughter grow up. I can tell you, Speaker, from the early days when I sat just back here when I first arrived at 31 years old, always the people of Carleton were on my mind because of the agrarian roots of the city of Ottawa and the challenges they had to face, particularly when the Green Energy Act was brought forward by the Liberals and how their hydro bills would steadily and rapidly increase.", "Of course, the people of Kars were very upset in North Gower when a wind turbine was expressed for our community. We stood against it, and we fought against it. It was another area, when you talk about the Green Energy Act, that has skyrocketed hydro bills in this province and has eroded the trust in what was then a public utility and which now is a public-private partnership, which is Hydro One.", "But, Speaker, over the years I have also had the opportunity to be the energy critic and speak with my constituents in Carleton about some of the challenges they faced with Hydro One. As you’ll recall, when I was the energy critic, not only were we dealing with the issues of wind turbines, but we were also dealing with a billing crisis at Hydro One where many of my constituents were being billed exorbitant numbers and it was very hard for them to keep up with those payments.", "There was a real attitude problem at the time at Hydro One. At that time, I would frequently call for the firing of the CEO. I know he would call me—the then CEO—to try and say, “Well, you know, things are great.” Well, they were not great. When I would go into a small community in Edwards, a little Lynnwood trailer park, to meet with some of my constituents, who are elderly, and I would go into their trailer in the middle of January—and, Speaker, in the middle of January, if you’re in Ottawa, it’s minus 26. It might be minus 40 in the city of Ottawa. I would go into their little trailer—not the best insulated, and it would be dark. We would be talking, and they’d be wearing all of their coats and they wouldn’t be able to put their lights on. Then we would be talking about Facebook and they couldn’t get on Facebook in the afternoon. I would say, “So what’s going on?” They said, “We can’t afford our heat. We can’t afford our electricity.” That’s what was happening, and that’s what happened under this area.", "So when Doug Ford and my colleagues from my caucus get upset with Hydro One, it’s just insult after insult after insult after injury after injury after insult with Hydro One, and now that the government has sold most of it off and they’re not being perhaps the most open and transparent with this either—because we know from the Financial Accountability Officer and we know from the Auditor General that we’re going to see even more shares going towards private companies. The government had promised—they were adamant in the last election that they weren’t going to do it, then they turned around and then they sold out.", "What happened was, we have great greenhouses—and I know, Speaker, you have some great greenhouses in your community. I’ve been to your riding with you. I can tell you, I have friends who have invested a lifetime—and I’m not just talking about money, but their blood, their sweat, their tears, their heart and their soul into their greenhouse or their agricultural operation.", "I’m talking about SunTech tomatoes, the little miracles from Manotick, where my friend, Bob Mitchell, is having a rough go, wondering if he should stay in Ontario or go to Mexico for his product because of the high hydro rates as a result of the policies of this government but also of Hydro One.", "My friend Fernando over at Carleton Mushroom Farms is always working. He’s working so hard with his family. He’s in his father’s footsteps with his brother, Mike, trying to make a mushroom farm succeed, and they’re making it succeed. You can go into Ross’s Independent and pick up their mushrooms. But the government’s got to get out of their way and make it easier for them, and Hydro One, in its current iteration, is not making that happen.", "When Fernando and Bob, who are trying to make ends meet and trying ensure that they have a product on the shelves at our local grocery stores in Ottawa, are confronted with these exorbitant hydro rates, I think it’s an insult to them to say that Mayo Schmidt is making $6 million. I think that sends the wrong message to our job creators and our food producers in this province.", "I have Schouten farm, the largest dairy farm in eastern Ontario, and I have Foster farms, which runs the largest grain elevator in eastern Ontario.", "Speaker, these are people I’m not going to represent on June 8 if I’m returned. I will just be representing the urban part of Nepean, which is inside the city of Ottawa. But they will need a strong advocate, and I have promised them that even though I will not be their MPP, I will continue to stand up for them—their rural and agrarian way of life—and I will ensure that they get a fair shake from this government.", "I don’t see what’s happening at Hydro One as fair." ],

And then we have these job producers, and it’s making it more difficult.", "I am standing here today to support my colleague Vic Fedeli, our leader in the House—my leader outside this House, Doug Ford, will be the Premier of this province—and calling for the government to reverse the changes to Hydro One CEO severances, and calling for the resignation of the entire board. I’m doing that because the people of Nepean–Carleton deserve to know that the government is on their side and that we are for the people.", "In these final seconds, before I cede the floor to my colleagues, again, I just want to say to the people of Carleton: For everything that you have given me, I am eternally grateful.

But this is the part that’s interesting to me—and I wish the Conservatives could all listen to this, because most of these guys were here.

That shows you how much they cared about capping CEO salaries.", "This is a good one. The Liberals will remember this. In 2013, Andrea Horwath’s bill—on capped salaries. That was our bill. Our bill was to cap salaries. All the PCs, every single elected PC, joined with the Liberals to defeat it in a minority government. If the PCs had joined with the NDP on that bill, it wouldn’t have been defeated and we would have the capping of CEO salaries. But they chose, because they didn’t want to cap CEO salaries.", "And now you go back and you talk about the PCs. Their platform is the same as the Liberals’. They have no problem borrowing $40 billion—no problem. But here’s the problem with it: You know who is going to have to pay back that $40 billion? You know who is going to have to pay it all back? I’m asking everybody. The Liberals are here; the PCs are here. My kids and my grandkids. You’re sticking them with that bill, and they support that. So as they stand up and say what they’re saying about how they care about us, well, they don’t care about my kids.", "And now, when you take a look at the CEO salaries—because I have to stay on the bill a bit—the CEO for Manitoba got $409,000 per year.

I’m going to tell you, nobody in the province of Ontario wants anybody paving over the greenbelt. We own that. It’s ours. We have to support our farmers, and I’ll tell you why.

There is no end to how effective the Liberals can be in making Ontarians pay billions of dollars more than necessary for hydro.", "It’s never too late to do the right thing, Speaker. A great way to start would be to support this motion and recognize that the compensation for Hydro One executives is outrageous and unacceptable. If the government does not support this motion, the government needs to answer the following questions: Why do you think the $6-million compensation for the CEO of Hydro One is fair? Did you know that the severance package for the CEO was going to be increased to $10 million?

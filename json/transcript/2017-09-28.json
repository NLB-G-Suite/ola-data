Whether that is the front-line carpenter, the small contractor, the medium-sized business, they’ve all been advocating for this for seven or eight years.", "I had the opportunity this week, as I’m sure many of you did, to meet with advocates/stakeholders with respect to this bill. I met with COCA and ECAO on Monday, and I’m sure that we’ll be meeting with some other prompt-payment advocates when they have their upcoming lobby day while this bill continues to be debated and moves into committee.", "So the government, at least from the NDP’s perspective, has had plenty of years: You’ve been in government for 17 years; people have been advocating for 11 years. In fact, the Minister of Transportation, I believe, when he won his by-election back in 2013, brought forward Bill 69. He became the minister, and it still took five long years to get this bill in front of this Legislature—actually, quicker than many of us ever get our private members’ bills into the Legislature, right? Many of us actually have our bills sitting waiting in committees where there aren’t even any other bills and the government refuses, for whatever reason, to bring those bills forward.

There are many sides. There are many groups and individuals pushing for solutions that best serve their interests. Bill 142 amends the Construction Lien Act and is the long-promised follow-up to the review for prompt-payment practices in the construction industry.", "The review was done in 2016, Striking the Balance: Expert Review of Ontario’s Construction Lien Act, authored by Bruce Reynolds and Sharon Vogel. I’ve heard, when I had the meetings with COCA and others, that they were happy with the review and thought that these two folks really examined the issues that were important to the construction industry. They believe—some of them believe—that this does strike a balance.", "Prompt payment is an issue for the construction industry. It refers to the requirement on business or contract owners, usually on construction and infrastructure builds, for fair and reasonable payment terms with their suppliers and throughout the supply chain. COCA told me that in the olden days, many years ago, 30 days used to be the norm for prompt payment, for people to actually pay their bills. That then became 60 days, 90 days, 120 days. In fact, I’ve even been told by one or two stakeholders that the government doesn’t pay their bills in less time than 90 days or 120 days. The government is actually going to have to comply with this law at the end of the day as well.", "Now, Reynolds and Vogel pulled together an expert panel of 15 knowledgeable people to help them with the work. The final report finally was released and seemed to strike a fair and reasonable balance point among the competing stakeholders’ interests.", "We know that the construction industry represents about 7% of Ontario’s workforce—more than 400,000 Ontarians work in construction—and yet delinquent payment in construction is rampant and a growing problem. The trade contractors are commonly forced to wait long periods of time, four months or longer, to get paid for work that has been certified as being complete. In construction projects, just like in residential building, there’s a holdback and there are payment periods. But even when the work is signed off as being complete, people are still waiting four months. That doesn’t bode well for small and medium-sized businesses that may not have the cash flow of the big developers and builders in this province, and from out of country as well.", "Ontario and Canada began to lag behind a majority of other jurisdictions that already have prompt-payment legislation. Forty-nine states in the US already have prompt payment; 31 states have it in place for the private sector. The US federal government has had prompt-payment legislation since 1982, and many European countries all have this legislation in place. So why is it taking so long in this great province of Ontario? Sure, we can pat ourselves on the back today for being the first province in Canada to implement it, but comparatively across the world, we are still lagging behind other countries.", "The existing law here in Ontario, the Construction Lien Act, is costly. It’s costly: It’s in the courts, so we’re hiring lawyers and sitting in front of judges to make decisions on whether or not companies should get paid. In the meantime, some of these businesses are actually going out of business because they don’t have the cash flow or the ability to stay in business, and sometimes they end up losing their business because of all the money they’ve had to spend on legal fees trying to get the money that they were duly owed.", "The bill only addresses non-payment as opposed to delinquent payment, and the lien rights of many in the industry will expire long before they realize that they will not get paid.", "The delinquent payment drives up the cost of construction, I’m told, because now contractors are actually building delinquent payments into the cost of the project. If it’s in the private sector, individuals are paying more, and if it’s jobs in the public sector, the taxpayers are actually paying more, because the delinquent fees are now included in the costs.", "It strains the cash flow for small businesses. Delinquent payment stymies new job creation and restricts investments in apprenticeship training, as the trade contractors sometimes have to limit their payroll commitments to meet their cash flow expectations. So that affects training of people apprenticing in the construction industry. The construction industry accounts for roughly 40% of all apprenticeships.", "Late-payment practices erode competition, the level playing field for all of those who maintain honourable practices and businesses. They are actually put at a disadvantage. It can drive out the small competitors and push prices up.", "When I talked to COCA I used an example of what happened in Niagara. It was outside of the construction industry; it was in waste management. We had probably a dozen small waste management contractors working across Niagara, in the various municipalities. Then the region of Niagara took over waste management in a triple majority vote. The first time that they tendered that big contract, they pushed all of the small players out. The company that won the bid put in a low-ball bid. I think it was for a three-year term. Then, at the end of the three-year term, all the small contractors were gone. All the employees were let go from these various small contractors. They weren’t able to go out and buy the many pieces of equipment that they would have needed to do a larger area of waste management collection in our municipalities. Then, when the next tender came in three or four years later, it was double the cost of that first low-ball tender which actually forced out many small business operators.", "The same thing happens here in the construction industry when you don’t have legislation in place to pay people in a timely way such that they can actually keep their business going, can compete for jobs. That, in itself, will create jobs and keep prices down for consumers.", "Locally, I can tell you that in my region there are currently two major projects that are in litigation because of lack of prompt payment as contracted. A third project has caused the contractor to claim bankruptcy due to a lack of payment. I’m not going to name them, because they’re all in some kind of litigation, but three that I’m aware of, just in Niagara.", "An interesting fact is that the entities not paying within the payment terms of the contract—normally 30 days—are in excess of 120 days. Locally, in Niagara, we know that these are repeat offenders that are not paying companies again and again. And they do this because there are gaps in this legislation, gaps that the government has known about for, well, at least seven or eight years—maybe 20 years. Although there’s been numerous lobby days on this legislation since I’ve been here for seven years, the government has chosen to do nothing about it. And who pays? The contractors pay. The employees pay. The families of the people working for these companies sometimes pay, because those workers actually get laid off or there’s a work stoppage because they’re not paid, and so somebody is not coming home with a paycheque at the end of the week to feed the kids and buy the clothes and pay the hydro bills.", "At the end of the day, it’s about workers. Everyone who goes to work, we say in health and safety, deserves to come home, and everybody who goes to work deserves to come home with a paycheque and to be paid in a timely manner.", "I know the members from Hamilton, all three of the members from the Hamilton ridings, have talked about the Hamilton Ticats stadium. This building—a $140-million stadium that I think was built around the time of the Pan Am Games—saw some serious delays. Those delays were related to the lack of, or delays in, payments by the lead international contractor. It impacted down the chain until even the individual masonry workers and electricians weren’t paid for hundreds of hours that they worked. I don’t know if they’ve been paid to this day.", "Another issue that one of the contractors brought to my attention was—the member from Niagara Falls raised the issue of benefits—health and welfare benefits. The big one that gets forgotten in this discussion is that when people are not being paid for contracting work, their case was that not only that the pay is withheld but in fact their benefits and benefit packages are not being taken care of. So this impacts the worker and their spouse and their family members, because suddenly they go to the dentist and guess what? The benefit plan hasn’t been paid because that contractor doesn’t have the cash flow to actually make those contributions to the benefit plan or to make contributions, perhaps, to the pension plan. So at the end of the day, the workers and their families are being denied health benefits. Here I make my pitch for universal pharmacare. The NDP has certainly been very vocal in the last few months about a universal pharmacare plan if we’re elected in 2018—not a plan that applies just to newborns to age 25; a plan that would actually give benefit coverage to every person in this province, regardless of age.", "During the committee hearings on the previous prompt-payment bill in 2014, a presenter from Wilkins and associates who was a third-party administrator talked about benefits and pension plans for the Ontario construction industry workers. What they said was that 2013 statistics for Ontario construction trade plans pointed out six things. Some 19% of the contributions due to the health and pension plans were late. So 19% were late, in the construction industry, to the plan administrator. That’s a significant number of people if you talk about workers. It’s probably close to 80,000 workers whose benefit contributions were late. So hundreds and hundreds of hours were collectively spent by trustees, administrators and their counsels dealing not only with trying to obtain the contributions, these delayed contributions because contractors were not being paid by the big guys, but also with frustrated employees who found that they were without health coverage or that benefit coverage was jeopardized because their contributions to their benefit plans and their pension plans were not received on time.", "So there are a few things, Speaker, missing in the bill. I know we’ll be going to committee and we’ll have the opportunity to be tabling some amendments that the stakeholders may or may not bring forward, but in terms of the central issue addressed by Bill 142, prompt payment, the bill is a marked improvement and consistent with what we believe the allied trade groups in the construction industry and in caucus have been calling out for.", "While the commissioned expert report that Bill 142 is built from does call for and set out what the prompt-payment regime for the construction industry should look like, in keeping with other government legislation we’ve seen, it does not signal how this schedule would be enforced.", "So, as I always say, the proof is in the pudding—the regulations—at the end of the day, right? This is a framework, but until we actually see the regulations—and some of the members talked about regulations yesterday when we were debating another bill here in the House. I think that when bills are coming forward, the members who are sitting here who are elected to represent people should at least have some idea of what those regulations might look like.", "The lack of enforcement will also be a big piece here. With so many government measures, this is a critical missing piece. How is the government going to monitor and enforce prompt payment? Are they going to be hiring enforcement officers? Is it going to be strictly a complaint-based system? Those are some of the questions, I believe, that aren’t answered. Without enforcement measures laid out explicitly, there is little expectation that the policy will even be effective, and few reasons to celebrate upon affirming that prompt payment, long overdue, is the right thing to do.", "I did have some questions that I asked COCA when they were in visiting me this week, because there were concerns raised by other stakeholders about what happens if the adjudication process fails. COCA, which has been quite involved in the process, says that the contractor can still stop work if the adjudication resolution is not complied with. So if the adjudicator orders some specific rules around a project, and orders payment or partial payment, however that works, and it’s not complied with, the trade contractor can stop work. Speaker, I am told that at the end of the day, at the end of the job, even with the adjudication process, the contractors will still have the right to go to court to enforce the adjudication ruling, and that the lien rights will still apply.", "It seems that most of the stakeholders are satisfied with the bill. We’ll be hearing more from them, I’m sure, as we move into the clause-by-clause. I look forward to engaging with them again." ],

He tells me that within the industry there are many cases where we’re talking about tens of thousands of dollars—and this is a small business—that are not paid on time.

The Attorney General told this House last week when he spoke that the construction industry plays a key role in helping Ontario’s economy thrive. There are more than 400,000 workers in the construction industry, and that accounts for almost 7% of Ontario’s GDP. That’s quite significant. The construction industry, in many ways, provides a solid foundation for our economy. It builds Ontario up, and it’s what keeps our economy thriving day after day, month after month, year after year. That’s why this bill is so vitally important.", "If passed, our proposed changes will be the biggest changes in Ontario’s construction industry in over 30 years. These changes are quite important and, as I said, over 30 years in the making. Our proposal would update our construction laws to align with the best practices offered in many other international jurisdictions. That will create a better, fairer climate for businesses here at home and could help ensure that each and every worker on a project is paid on time, which means that they, in turn, can support their families.", "Madam Speaker, I want to talk about the construction sector for a minute. To recap what Minister Naqvi said to the House two weeks ago: Ontario’s construction sector operates like a pyramid. The owner or developer enters into agreements with one or more general contractors. These contractors enter into agreements with subcontractors to work on different parts of the project, and so the downward flow continues as these subcontractors hire workers and suppliers to help them meet their own obligations. So, if you mapped it all out on a piece of paper, it would look something like a pyramid, with the owner or developer on the top and contractors and subcontractors, and their subcontractors, branching outward and downward. The payment process would flow down the same route; that’s why we call it a pyramid. The owner or developer gets paid, and the money then flows downward, changing hands until everyone on the project has been paid.", "When a company doesn’t get paid for their work, the downward flow stops short. Contractors don’t get paid, and they can’t pay people they’ve hired either. So this lack of payment affects cash flow, which affects payroll and delays payments needed for trade workers, suppliers and everyone else who has worked on the project. That can be devastating to workers and their families.", "Working in construction can be tough; it’s mentally and physically exhausting, this field of work. What happens after a long day and after a long week when there’s no paycheque? You can imagine it’s not a good situation, and workers are frustrated. It’s just not right, and our government wants to do something about it to make sure that everyone gets paid down the pyramid model. So we’re doing something about it, Madam Speaker.", "Our government introduced a way to make sure our construction laws are up to date and reflect today’s realities. We have a way to stand up for the needs of Ontario’s workers and businesses. If passed, the proposed Construction Lien Amendment Act would modernize construction laws to make payments and adjudication processes fairer and simpler, and work better for businesses, their employees and their families who are depending on them. That’s why this bill is so important.", "Madam Speaker, the Construction Lien Act was created in 1983. That’s well over 30 years ago, and 30 years ago the world was much different. Business was conducted with a handshake; your word was your bond. A lot has changed since then. In 1983, contractors figuring out the cost of a project would bring out their desk calculators and slide rules so they could give their customers an estimate of what the price of the project would be. Plans were drawn up on blueprints. These, of course, were huge rolls of paper covered in meticulous drawings and figures. And project schedules were developed manually, with dates marked in pencil on a calendar and then rubbed out as things changed. There was no construction estimating software. There were no digital building plans. In fact, computers were just basically starting out at that time period. In the past 30 years the world has changed; we have changed too.", "The construction laws that worked for the industry back then aren’t what we need today. Construction projects and payment processes have become more and more complex, and late payments are a problem in every sector of the industry. The increased complexity of construction projects also means that resolving disputes takes more time than ever. It can sometimes takes years before people see the money owed to them. That means a lot of families have to put their plans on hold, in some cases indefinitely. Frankly, this is no way to conduct business.", "Over the past decade, Madam Speaker, we received several proposals from stakeholders about how to change the Construction Lien Act. While everyone agreed that there were things that needed to be changed in the act, it had always been difficult to reach consensus on exactly what changes needed to be made, which in large part can be attributed to the diversity of the industry. That’s why, in 2014, we announced that we would launch an independent review of the Construction Lien Act, including how we could address payment issues in the construction industry.", "In February 2015, we retained Bruce Reynolds and Sharon Vogel, both of whom are leading experts in construction law at the law firm of Borden Ladner Gervais, to head up this review. We made it clear to them that they needed to get this seemingly impossible job done. I’m pleased to say that they did it. After much research and consultation, Bruce and Sharon helped to reach a broad consensus on three core issues regarding this bill:", "(1) Maintaining and modernizing the lien and holdback process;", "(2) Establishing a new system for prompt payment; and", "(3) Creating a targeted adjudication system to resolve these disputes.", "They landed on a plan for a way forward and worked closely with an advisory group of dozens of stakeholders to develop a report that had a concrete, workable solution to reform Ontario’s construction legislation. One year ago, we released their report titled Striking the Balance: Expert Review of Ontario’s Construction Lien Act. Balance is absolutely the right word for this report, because its recommendations carefully weighed the many, many competing interests across the construction industry.", "Our bill includes some key amendments that will modernize construction lien and holdback rules. Our stakeholders recognize the difficulties with the holdback process, as they agree that maintaining a fund for liens that can be claimed is important. But that same holdback process could also reduce the speed in which the payment flows down the construction pyramid. So, Madam Speaker, we want to ensure holdback fees are paid out as soon as the deadline to file construction liens against the project has passed or the lien claims have been resolved.", "Contractors and subcontractors should be able to count on getting paid when they should get paid and know that they can meet their downward payment obligations in a timely manner, so they can pay the people that they employ below them in the pyramid scheme.", "This new bill would also require surety bonds to be posted on public projects above a certain dollar amount. These bonds are currently used on both public and private projects. There is no legislation that mandates contractors to post them, so mandatory surety bonds would protect subcontractors and suppliers and make sure they get paid in case a project becomes insolvent.", "We also heard that contractors and subcontractors want more time to resolve disputes out of court and avoid additional legal fees. We propose that we expand the timeline for filing liens and starting court actions from 90 to 150 days instead. We are also proposing that specific bookkeeping requirements are set out to better protect subcontractors if a contractor becomes insolvent. In this way, we are trying to ensure that the payment process down the pyramid continues uninterrupted.", "The proposed changes would also ensure that the legislation reflects the structure of large public-private projects. Madam Speaker, we know that people want to spend as little time and money as possible resolving their construction lien claims. That’s why we’re proposing that the construction lien claims under $25,000 be resolved in small claims courts instead of going to larger, higher courts. We think this will speed up the dispute resolution process and make it as cost-effective as possible.", "Finally, we are proposing that we change the name of the Construction Lien Act to be called, instead, the Construction Act, to reflect the broader range of issues it covers.", "I’m just going to take a break here for a minute. Keeping my eye on the clock there.", "Late payment is one of the most pressing issues facing the construction sector today. When a company does not get paid for work, it sets off a chain reaction that affects its own payroll and the payment it needs to make to others. This can be devastating for workers, for businesses and for the entire project. Under the proposed legislation, the deadline for making a payment will be triggered by the first submission of a proper invoice, which would clearly state information like the amount owing and the payment terms, and invoices would be submitted monthly unless the parties set out different arrangements for their contracts. So we’re creating more rules to make sure that the money flows down and payment is made properly.", "These changes would mean that both parties must negotiate and set out details before actual work has even begun. But if you can’t agree on payment timelines, both parties will have to follow the timeline for payments set out in the legislation. The legislation will act as a guiding way to make sure that the payments flow through properly.", "For instance, once an invoice has been submitted to the contractor, the owner would be required to pay the contractor within 28 days. We have a solid number: 28 days, or 4 weeks, to pay that amount. That contractor must then pay his subcontractors within seven days of receiving the payment. And these subcontractors need to pay their subcontractors within seven days as well.", "We’re setting out definite dates by which to pay the subcontractors that go below other contractors. This will help ensure that funds are not held back at the top and everyone is paid in a timely manner. Knowing exactly when to expect payment allows contractors and suppliers to run their businesses more effectively, make more competitive bids and meet their financial responsibilities in a timely fashion.", "In the event that an owner or contractor fails to make a payment, mandatory interest would be added to the amount owed. Owners will be able to dispute an invoice by notifying the contractor within 14 days of any amounts that will be withheld from payment. If the parties don’t reach an agreement at that point, the contractor could refer the case to a new construction dispute interim adjudication system. This is new. We’re creating this new construction dispute interim adjudication system. I think it’s quite important to our new legislation.", "This brings me to the next major part of the bill. Adjudication is a critical part of the prompt-payment system. It is the key to speeding up the dispute resolution process as well as enforcing the process. It also gives owners the ability to dispute invoices when they feel there is a problem with work done on a project or the amount owed to them.", "Those in the construction industry who have experience in litigation, particularly on large or complex projects, will understand the time and investment that are all too often involved in resolving a dispute in court. In some cases, the process to get to trial can take up to a year. The new system we are proposing, if passed, will mark a dramatic change to the industry. While today it can take a year to get to trial, under the proposed legislation a qualified expert will look at the issue and provide an interim decision in just six weeks. Six weeks is a lot better than a full year—I think, again, another major change by introducing this new six-week timeline into the legislation.", "Once an adjudication is finished, the parties can then decide if they want to take the issue to court or if they want to treat the six-week decision as a final decision. This adjudication system means that the parties do not have to wait for the issue to move through the court system that presently exists right now. The six-week decision can be binding, and if they want to stick to that decision, they can; it’s up to them. They can continue to work on the project without delay. If the result of the adjudication is that the owner must pay and the owner then refuses, the case may still go to court. But in the meantime, the contractor would have the right to suspend work.", "As you can see, we tried to make sure everyone’s interests are covered with the proposed amendments that maintain a sense of fairness and balance. It has taken 34 years to get to this stage, to finally get legislation that works to make various parties happy and to agree on a new system of operating construction in Ontario. It’s important that we get every aspect of this proposed legislation right.", "Should this bill move forward to the committee stage, which I hope it will, we look forward to further input and ideas from stakeholders to make this new legislation even better. We’re not ramming this bill down the Legislature; we’re saying, “Let’s go to committee and hear from other stakeholders, or the same stakeholders, to make the new legislation better or make amendments to the legislation.” If this bill passes, we look forward to seeing the difference it will make to the hundreds of thousands of people and families in Ontario supported by this critical sector.", "I want to just say, in closing, that we need to update our laws to support the thousands of workers and their families who rely on the construction industry as a key source of their income. The changes we’re proposing to this bill, which has been two years in the making, will have an impact on nearly everyone involved in a construction project, from the companies that are involved on large, multi-million-dollar construction projects to the families doing small-scale renovations of their homes.", "When I think of my riding of Scarborough Southwest, Madam Speaker, in my area there are both large, multi-million dollar construction projects and also smaller projects such as renovations being done on homes. Anything in this area will be covered by this legislation. I can tell you, there’s a lot of very large condominiums being built across the city, but a lot being built in Scarborough Southwest. When I commute back and forth from work, especially, I can see the construction going on, whether it be condominiums or people who want to invest more in their property and make changes or renovations to their home and decide to hire contractors to do the work.", "So this represents the biggest proposed change for Ontario’s construction industry in over 30 years, and it marks the first-ever time industry stakeholders have reached a consensus on key issues such as modernizing lien and holdback rules, prompt payment and adjudication. This alone is a significant milestone.", "Of course, our work is not yet done. We will need the continued support and advice of our stakeholders at the committee stage and will be making refinements based on their input. It’s important because, as we work through this process with this very complex legislation, dealing with so many parties at one time, we want to make sure that we hear from the stakeholders at the committee stage—as we usually do, having them make presentations or submissions; some can be written instead of oral—and we listen and then, after we’ve heard from everybody, we then decide to go clause-by-clause through the legislation and, if necessary, make changes to the legislation, which I think is very important. Our government is aware of that. We’re not saying this legislation is carved in stone and that we’re just going to go forward and put this through. I think it’s very important that we hear from the stakeholders and make changes if necessary.", "Madam Speaker, I look forward to our continued work to ensure that our construction sector thrives and drives our economy forward, so I’m glad to hear the members speak today. I think all three parties are basically on the same page. We agree that we have to make changes to the construction industry and the Construction Lien Act. I think it’s very significant that the new bill will be called the Construction Act so people understand that here are the rules in Ontario for construction. Again, that’s a very important thing for this bill.", "I’ve been listening throughout the debate on this bill as various people get up and speak, and I’m happy to hear that they are in agreement with the bill, for the most part. Again, there could be changes. I keep repeating this, but it’s important that we’re open to changes from stakeholders and those who present. The parties will have input at that point, at the committee stage, and then we can bring this back up for third reading.", "Thank you very much, Madam Speaker—I actually fit it in with a few seconds left." ],

I know that there’s a willingness on all sides of this chamber to have transparency and openness, but lacking some clarity in that particular area is a bit of an impediment.", "They also raised with me, Speaker, that there’s no ability to appeal adjudicative decisions, but they may still take a case to court, and there’s no requirement to report back to the House regarding the activities or outcomes resulting from the decisions of the authorized nominating authority.

It wasn’t a local company here in Ontario. I can’t believe that somebody in Ontario couldn’t have built the Hamilton Ticats stadium. But what happened there is that the workers didn’t get paid. Electricians didn’t get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for the project. There were delays, there were safety issues. There were all kinds of problems with the Hamilton Ticats thing.", "Then what happened is, when they went to have their sons or daughters or wives go to get a prescription, their benefits weren’t paid as well.

One of the very first meetings that I had after I was elected was with groups from COCA that came to talk about this very issue. Late payment may not affect the very first person at the top of the scale, but by the time it trickles down, unfortunately, small businesses, usually small local businesses, don’t have the ability to get money to pay their workers or they have to go to the bank and borrow money and it costs them money. They don’t have the cash flow and that is unfortunate. No one should have to go without their paycheque. That is wrong.", "Also, big companies are waiting to pay perhaps the union dues or, as a colleague said, the benefits. Those things have to be paid by a certain time.

What I hear from a lot of small business people is that that environment—when you take something like the lack of prompt payment, so they’re not getting their cash flow coming through, and then you add on the hydro rates—300% to 400% increases under this Liberal government—it makes it very daunting.", "They start to talk to me a little bit about when you’re going to sell Hydro One and lose that opportunity and the rates are going to go up. They talk about things like the Fair Hydro Act, where they borrowed $25 billion, which is going to cost our economy between $45 billion and $93 billion. That’s another cost that’s going to be added on to their business. So how do they stay competitive? How do they continue to go?", "The potential of a 32% increase to minimum wage—and again, no one on this side of the House is arguing that people don’t need, certainly, a minimum wage to survive on, but to put a 32% increase in in 18 months—we hear continually that this government is out of touch and they are moving too fast.", "They talk about amendments, and it’s interesting when they say, “We’re happy to listen to amendments, and we’ll make amendments.”", "Madam Speaker, with the Green Energy Act, if we recall, they usurped all power from local authorities, from municipally elected officials, to actually make decisions in their community, and they’re the closest to the people.", "I have sat through various committees where the—I think for one we had 52 amendments that we put forward, and the government did not accept a single one. So the trust factor of a government that says, “We will work with you. We’ll bring amendments. We’ll be willing to work with you”—that trust capacity has been lost, not only in this House, but across the greater province. Many of the business people and individuals out there are saying to me, “We’re struggling to trust a government that keeps telling us one thing but does the exact opposite.”", "It’s harder to live in Ontario under this Liberal government, and this prompt-payment act hopefully will help at least our small businesses." ],

I had the opportunity to work in the construction industry, where I saw the negative impact that delayed payment had on the enormous amount of small business owners in the construction industry specifically.", "The negative impacts have not been overblown in debate here today. In fact, if anything, I would say that negative impact has been perhaps underrepresented—not intentionally, but I think that when we sit here in this place, sometimes these issues seem a bit distant to us, and we may not always be able to realize how impactful they are on a husband, a father or a mother, a wife who is a business owner and is working very, very hard to make a go of a small company—perhaps a framing company such as the one I worked for, or a small excavating company such as another one I worked for.", "The reality is that when this payment is delayed—as it often is, unfortunately, for extended periods of time—it has a negative impact on the cash flow of that business, which has a huge impact on the ability of that business to continue with production, to continue with paying their employees. In fact, I’ve been in a situation myself where I was in a very close relationship with my employer and he asked me if I would be willing to wait for my paycheque a couple of extra weeks, because he was waiting on cheques from companies that he was subcontracting for. I’ve been in a situation where this had a very real impact on me in a very personal way and I can definitely understand the concerns of the construction industry when it comes to delayed payment.", "I appreciated the chance earlier this week to meet briefly with COCA, as I’m sure many members in this House did, and had a chance to speak with some of those members and the organizations they represent in a broad variety of fields with a wide variety of expertise.

This isn’t the first time that people have brought forward the reality that delayed payment has a negative impact. This isn’t the first time: Prior Liberal governments have claimed to want to solve this issue. I’m not denigrating their desire to help the construction industry, but it is the third time that we’ve come to this place, that we’ve had this debate, and then the legislation didn’t go through the House, with both past attempts unfortunately dying on the order table due to elections being called by the Liberal government.", "I don’t wish to be pessimistic, but with another election on the horizon, there is a possibility for history to repeat itself once again. I’m sure that we wouldn’t wish to see this worthy endeavour die on the order paper. I don’t wish to be rude and I don’t wish to indulge in floccinaucinihilipilification, but it is indeed a possibility and one that I think we have to be aware of, that this legislation wouldn’t go through the House in a speedy manner. But I hope we do see it go through in a very speedy manner.", "The PC Party has long been a strong advocate, a long-time advocate and passionate advocate to bring prompt-payment legislation to Ontario, because we recognize the impact that this has on small business and, really, larger businesses as well. We recognize that the impact this has is not simply business in a broad sense but really on individuals in their day-to-day, as my own personal experience testifies to, being able to have that paycheque come through and being able to count on reliable payment for services rendered, for goods provided.", "This bill contains three major components, with the first part being the prompt-payment regime, part 2 containing the creation of the authorized nominating authority to manage the new adjudication model created under this act, and part 3 outlining the adjudicative process, and I’ll get to that in a couple of minutes. I still do have some time.", "I wanted to very briefly touch on a report that was put forward a couple of years ago by Prism Economics and Analysis.

Allow me, Madam Speaker, if you will, the opportunity to contribute to debate today with some brief readings from this report. This report, I think, is very informative on some of the concerns that the association and the Ontario General Contractors Association as well as the National Trade Contractors Coalition of Canada have had with delayed payment, with some of their concerns and the need for prompt-payment legislation.", "I’ll read from page 3 very briefly, where it states:", "“Late payment practices are an important issue for the Ontario construction industry. These practices have negative consequences for the construction industry and for the broader economy, including:", "“—reduced employment in the construction industry,", "“—less investment in apprenticeship,", "“—greater use of ‘independent operators’,", "“—less investment in machinery and equipment and hence lower productivity,", "“—higher construction costs because of the need to factor in late payment risk,", "“—smaller bidding pools because payment risk forces contractors to limit the amount of work they take on, and", "“—an erosion of the principle of a level playing field by rewarding those contractors that delay payments without justification while penalizing those contractors who are forced to cope with late payments.”", "I think we can all agree that those are some significant issues that are brought forward in this report. The report goes into quite a significant amount of detail. It’s 44 pages, and I would encourage members in this House, and especially those who take the opportunity to study this legislation in committee, to perhaps download a copy of this report, to read it through for themselves. It lays out very simply, but also in great detail, the unique structure of the construction industry that serves to amplify the consequences of late payment and how the construction industry is very distinct from other industries because of its complex system of contracting and subcontracting, which maximizes the benefits of specialization—but also, due to function, this system of contracting and subcontracting requires that cash flow through many levels of a pyramid structure. Obviously, any delay in the payment of that cash flow or any blockage in the cash flow structure has an immediate and negative impact on a lot of people who it fails to fall through to as well. Anywhere an interruption in the payment flow is created, this has a cascading effect down the rest of the contracting and subcontracting chain.", "What this bill will do is create—" ],

I want to start by acknowledging the tireless work of people across the province to change that fact, and thanking them. There are women and survivors and people in all of our communities who do not get nearly enough recognition but who have devoted their lives to ending domestic and sexual violence—people like Harmy Mendoza, executive director of WomanACT, the Woman Abuse Council of Toronto, an organization that does incredibly important work in this city; and people like Dawnmarie Harriott, a survivor and advocate who has tremendous courage and spoke out about her story this morning at our press conference. When Dawnmarie fled her abuser, she fell into poverty, and she struggled, like so many women do, to get their lives back. Now Dawnmarie has devoted herself to tackling huge systemic barriers, educating the public and creating the policy changes that we need to keep women and survivors safe across this province.", "The press conference that we held this morning was very moving. It was a very important opportunity to invite these women, who either have lived experience, as Dawnmarie has, or, in Harmy’s case, are women who are working all the time to protect women and get them the help they need.", "I also want to take a moment to especially thank my colleague MPP Peggy Sattler from the riding of London West. Peggy is our women’s critic here in the NDP caucus. She has been working diligently, tirelessly on the women’s issues file on behalf of the NDP here in this province. She has an incredibly strong will to advocate on behalf of women. She has been a fantastic advocate for improving the protections that survivors need in this province. Thank you, Peggy, for that important work.", "Countless women right now are trapped in an abusive relationship but feel that there’s no way out. Countless women right now are feeling that they have no options and no way to leave an unsafe home. Countless women have questions like these running through their minds as they try to leave, or consider leaving, a violent partner: Where will I live and be safe? Where will I find help?

It passes second reading here in this very type of forum—it has passed this kind of forum twice—but instead of bringing it to the forefront and getting it dealt with through the committee process, the government has not allowed it to move forward.", "So this summer, in order to try to address this horrific problem, we brought forward amendments to the government’s Bill 148, the Changing Workplaces Review legislation, to try to get that process to recognize that change has to happen, and to expand paid leave to survivors. But inexplicably, once again, the Wynne government defeated these crucial protections, they defeated the amendments that the NDP brought forward, and denied women in this province the right to paid leave.", "This kind of inaction means that survivors are still being left all alone, without the options and without the protections that they need to get out of violent relationships.

Il est temps de protéger les survivants.", "Extending 10 days of paid leave as well as up to 15 weeks of unpaid leave will finally give people the protection that they need to get out of an unsafe home and get their lives back.", "The way that this bill is structured would end up having the provincial government covering the cost of extending these 10 days of paid leave for survivors. We thought about this very carefully, and we believe, as New Democrats, that the necessity of providing that support is something that is the responsibility of all of us—not simply the employer, but all of us as a society. It’s everyone’s job to give survivors the support and protection that they need.", "Here’s what this bill will mean in the lives of survivors if we can actually get it passed into law. It means that women can take time off work to seek medical attention, including mental health supports and counselling, without the fear of losing their paycheque or losing their job. It means survivors can take the time to find a safe place to live for themselves and for their kids at a very stressful and difficult time, without losing their income and their ability to actually pay the rent once they find a place.", "It means that victims can take time away from their workplace, which may be the one place where their abuser knows that they’ll be. Women need to be able to take time away from that site. In fact, this is exactly what was discussed at our press conference this morning. The woman who shared her lived experience spoke very clearly about the fact that her abuser would show up at her work and force her to leave work. She knew what was coming every time that happened. After she quit her job, because she had to find safety, she was told that in fact he continued to visit her workplace to try to track her down.", "That’s why this 15 weeks of unpaid leave is so important, because it gives those survivors time to take away from their workplace and discourage their abuser from showing up there. It means that victims can take time to go to court without having their paycheque docked, and it means that no one in this province will have to pay the price just for looking out for their own safety and the safety of their children. This bill removes one of the reasons that women feel trapped in violent and abusive relationships. It’s one piece of the support that survivors need. It’s one crucial, practical step that this Legislature can take, after so much delay, to help women and survivors across the province. It will help break the cycle of violence and make Ontario a safer place for all of us.", "This morning, Harmy Mendoza from the Woman Abuse Council of Toronto reminded us of some of the victims right here in Ontario and across the country who have lost their lives because of domestic violence. I just want to take a moment to remember them in this Legislature. They’ve been spoken of here many times, and it’s shameful that we haven’t done enough to prevent the next victims from having that same fate:", "—Theresa Vince, who was murdered at her workplace in Chatham;", "—Lori Dupont, murdered at the hospital where she worked;", "—Ravinder Kaur Bhangu, who was just 23 years old when she was killed at the office where she worked; and", "—Camille Runke, who was murdered near her workplace.", "These women, and so many other victims, should have been better protected. They should have had the options, the protections and the support to know that they could leave the violence and rebuild their lives in safety. I want every woman in the province to know, from now on, that she is not trapped and that she will be protected. She will be able to take time off work. She will be able to come back to her job. She will be able to find a safe place to live, make sure her kids are safe and get their lives back.", "The way to make that happen is a very simple path, and that is to pass Bill 157 and not just refer it to committee and let it sit there but actually change the laws in this province to protect survivors. Progressive jurisdictions around the world are already doing this. Manitoba has done this. It’s in place in Australia, and has been for some time.", "This is what needs to happen here in Ontario. Women have waited long enough. By passing this bill, we can make sure that no woman has to choose between her job and her safety. In Ontario, we can protect them both—the jobs and the safety—so let’s do it." ],

We met over the course of nine months. We travelled to a number of communities—I believe it was about nine or 10. We heard from 147 witnesses during that time and we received many, many written submissions. All of that informed us of how serious this issue is and how we needed to move forward in addressing concerns.", "Everyone has the right to live a life free of violence. Domestic and sexual violence are not only horrific crimes, they’re also a significant and preventable barrier to women’s full equality. It will not be tolerated in Ontario.", "We want to thank the leader of the third party for bringing this PMB forward. It is a priority for this government that women feel safe in their homes, in their workplaces and in their communities. This is a top priority for our government, that women have that sense of security and safety. We understand and we recognize the severity of this issue and the impact it can have on people in their workplaces and at home. We heard the leader of the third party give us an explanation on people who have faced that danger within their workplaces, and no one should have to feel that when they’re at work.", "That is why through Bill 148, which this government has introduced, which we brought forward, we’re proposing to establish a new, separate leave for survivors of domestic and sexual violence. This is very important. It’s going to entitle employees who have worked for 13 consecutive weeks to 10 days and 15 weeks of leave when they or their children experience domestic or sexual violence or the threat of domestic or sexual violence.", "We believe that workers and their families need time and support when they’re dealing with these tremendously difficult circumstances. This leave would afford them that time. That bill is going to be coming before the House very shortly for another reading, and we hope that we can engage in a good discussion at that time. We look forward to having support from the opposition on that. We want to see it go through.", "We have launched a groundbreaking action plan called It’s Never Okay that is investing $41 million over three years, and we’ve implemented many initiatives to raise awareness of domestic violence and to strengthen supports for victims since 2004.", "You may recall that in late 2014 there was the case of Jian Ghomeshi at the CBC with allegations against him that were very disturbing. Canadians were talking about this, and we began talking about it here in the Ontario Legislature. That’s when we moved forward with our plan on It’s Never Okay. We had some groundbreaking commercials that ran on TV and on social media and received tremendous awareness and feedback around the world. In fact, online there were over eight million hits. People were watching these ads and saying how useful they were, they were revolutionary and they certainly got the message out.", "The Ministry of Labour’s Occupational Health and Safety Act is the only legislation of its kind in Canada to require employers to take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances to protect a worker when domestic violence may occur in the workplace. Workplaces in Ontario are also required to have workplace violence policies, programs, measures and procedures in place to protect workers from violence in the workplace, including domestic and sexual violence that may enter the workplace. We already have measures there.", "Through Bill 148, we want to build on that. There’s always more that we can do, and we do thank the leader of the third party for engaging us in this very important discussion this afternoon." ],

I will allow my colleague from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock to speak on it more on the women’s issue side, and I commend her for the tremendous work that she has done on our behalf in the PC Party for issues relating to the very important issue of safety and protection for women who find themselves in abusive relationships or situations.", "I had the opportunity to travel the province this summer on Bill 148, which was changes to the Employment Standards Act and the Labour Relations Act, and this bill, specifically, is amendments to the Employment Standards Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act. I had the opportunity to listen to an awful lot of deputations. One of the deputations that came forward requesting an amendment to Bill 148 specifically spoke about the need to have paid leave for people, almost exclusively women—not exclusively, but mostly, the vast majority—who find themselves in an abusive situation and need to find a way to hopefully get out of that or at least end that situation.", "She spoke clearly about the need to have that time: the time to go see a lawyer, to see victim services, to perhaps find another place to live, either temporarily or permanently—that all of those things take time, and what could not be done was to tip off the abuser that that person was away from work. The most certain way to tip off that abuser is if there’s a stoppage in the pay, because rest assured, if someone is living in an abusive relationship, that person they are with is controlling in so many ways, they would know exactly, to every nickel, whether they are making or not making that dollar. They would be watching closely to see any signs that they could be moving in a way that might end that relationship for their own safety, for the victim’s safety.", "So I understood why it had to be, that paid leave, but then I spoke to the lady afterwards and I said, “The reality of life here in Ontario in small business is that 10 paid days of leave can be very, very difficult for a small business.” I asked her, “What about if the state, the crown, us—if we believe as a society that we have a responsibility to protect women in abusive relationships, then if we’re going to have paid leave”—I wasn’t speaking to her in that fashion; I was speaking to the Legislature—“then we should be paying for it: our Legislature, our province, our crown.” She said, “That would be wonderful.” I put forward the thought of it and she said, “That would be wonderful.”", "Then I spoke to two labour leaders about it and they thought that was a good idea. I spoke to my colleague from Welland, my counterpart in the third party. Again, she said, “We want to do whatever we can to protect women in these situations. If it happens that the money can come from a central source, then so be it.”", "My suggestion would be that the employer pay upfront, because we can’t send up any flags. But then they could apply as quickly as possible to get reimbursement from the crown so that nobody knows what’s going on except the victim and the employer—who would be confidentially protecting them as well—and we, as a Legislature and society, would make sure that we do our part to end this scourge of violence against women.", "If people are in abusive relationships, we have a responsibility to protect them and to ensure that they have a way out in the surest way possible. Thank you to the leader of the third party for bringing this. We will be supporting this piece of legislation." ],

It certainly builds on the work that I have done previously in Bill 177 and Bill 26 to ensure that every survivor of domestic violence and sexual violence in this province has access to paid leave to help them recover from the trauma that they have experienced.", "I want to focus in my brief remarks on one of the provisions that’s included in Bill 157 that is particularly important if we are to ensure that women in this province are safe. That is the requirement for mandatory workplace training on domestic violence and sexual violence. We need to sensitize employers, managers and co-workers to the physical impacts and the psychological impacts of experiencing domestic violence and sexual violence so that when they get the request for leave, they understand why that leave is so critical to enable that employee to move forward and rebuild their lives.", "We also need to reduce the feeling of an employee who has experienced domestic violence or sexual violence that they may be stigmatized by their co-workers. We need to make co-workers aware of some of the warning signs so that they can provide assistance, perhaps referrals to some of the community organizations that could help a co-worker who is experiencing domestic violence or sexual violence. This provision for mandatory training is critical to truly ensure that the leave provisions will be accessed and that employees will feel comfortable using their right to access the leave.", "One of the unintended consequences of not providing paid leave, of just making unpaid leave available, which is what the Liberals have done, is that survivors may not be able to access that leave when they need it. They may not have the financial means to take an unpaid leave of absence and they will not step forward to request that unpaid leave.", "We also know that financial control is a classic symptom of an abusive partner. When the abuser has control over the finances, the victim, the survivor of domestic violence, may not be able to leave the employment or discontinue bringing those resources into the household because of the fear of further violence being perpetrated. Again, this is another consequence of not providing paid leave.", "We need to move forward with this legislation.

It is a priority for this government that women feel safe in the home, workplaces, schools, college campuses, university campuses and communities.", "That is why our government introduced, in 2004, the Domestic Violence Action Plan. The Ministry of the Status of Women has implemented a number of initiatives to raise awareness of domestic violence, strengthen supports for survivors and improve the justice system response.", "In essence, as we know, sexual violence is a brutal and traumatic crime, and the reality is, it is far too widespread in our society and has a devastating and lasting impact on survivors and their families.", "In fact, one in three women will experience some form of violence in their life, and this is unacceptable. We cannot tolerate this in our province.

We are investing $1.7 million in training for front-line workers in health, education, community and hospitality sectors to identify and support survivors of sexual violence and domestic violence. As you know, we can only help individuals, the victims of sexual violence and harassment, if we’ve got the proper systems in place and the proper know-how, knowledge and education to be able to identify it—there’s still a lot of stigma around sexual violence and harassment—and that we have the appropriate training for those front-line workers who see many of these victims.", "We have also established an Innovation Fund. This $3-million initiative supports seven survivor-focused projects to help those at higher risk of violence.", "We’ve also established the Creative Engagement Fund, which is a three-year, $2.25-million initiative that supports artistic projects that raise awareness and spark discussion about sexual violence and harassment.", "The government of Ontario, as part of its Sexual Violence and Harassment Action Plan Act, recognizes the trauma experienced by sexual assault survivors in the criminal justice system. That’s why we delivered a pilot project to provide independent legal advice to survivors. These important steps improve access to justice for survivors of sexual assault while enhancing the tools and knowledge of the judiciary to deal with sexual assault cases.", "I was part of the committee that travelled the province this summer to hear deputations on Bill 148, on the Changing Workplaces Review. It was a priority for many of the women’s advocacy groups that spoke to committee that 10 paid days of leave for domestic and sexual violence needed to happen, that it’s a priority. That was reiterated throughout the committee process for Bill 148, regardless of which city we were in or which town, whether it was in the north, southwestern Ontario or eastern Ontario.", "In the first draft of the bill, domestic and sexual violence were added as reasons to utilize personal emergency leave days, two of which are paid. Following public hearings, we amended the bill to establish a new, separate leave for domestic and sexual violence or the threat of domestic or sexual violence.", "We followed the model that is currently being used in Manitoba and are proposing 10 days and 15 unpaid weeks of leave, providing options to take single days or full weeks, allowing for more flexibility for the employee. An employee is entitled to this leave if they have worked for an employer for 13 consecutive weeks and if they or their child experiences domestic or sexual violence or the threat of domestic or sexual violence. The leave could be taken for reasons such as: to seek medical attention, to obtain services from a victims’ services organization, to obtain psychological or other professional counselling, to relocate temporarily or permanently, to seek legal or law enforcement assistance, or other reasons as may be prescribed.", "Madam Speaker, we have listened. We have made amendments. Is there more work to be done? Perhaps there is more work to be done. But the fact that we are talking about this here today—this very important discussion that we are having is important because the more we speak about it, the less stigma there will be around the issue.

As an advocate for human sex trafficking victims, I’ve spent the past two years travelling across the province, meeting with survivors and the front-line workers helping them. I’ve been brought to tears on numerous occasions, learning about the mental and emotional scars left behind by sexual abuse and exploitation and the difficulties that survivors face as they recover.", "One of the most important challenges is helping survivors restore their sense of dignity, and a big part of that is helping them return to work so that they are able to support themselves and they’re not trapped in an abusive relationship if they cannot do that.", "The effects of sexual abuse and exploitation take time to heal, and survivors need to know that they have the support of their community, including their employer. That is where the leaves of absence defined in this bill, with 10 days of paid leave and up to 15 weeks of unpaid leave, would be so helpful. Giving survivors the peace of mind of knowing that they can take the time that they need to heal without having to worry about facing negative consequences at work or losing their job will go a long way in helping them focus on healing and recovery.", "An important part of implementing this legislation will involve ensuring that employers are not only aware of these changes, but are also trained to understand the sensitivity of the issues surrounding sexual abuse and violence. Survivors often are afraid to talk about the abuse that they have experienced with their loved ones, let alone their employers. Much like I argue through my own private member’s bill calling for mandatory sexual assault training for judges, victims and survivors need to be confident that our institutions will be sensitive to their experiences to prevent them from being revictimized.", "Once this bill is passed and reaches the committee stage, I hope that it is brought forward by the government for debate.

Yes, we travelled this province and we listened to many presentations, and in each and every one of those presentations we were told that victims of domestic violence needed paid leave: not two days of PEL, paid emergency leave, which actually applies to sick leave or bereavement leave, or whatever other emergency leave in your life. They needed 10 days of leave. The government listened, but they did not hear them. In fact, when the NDP brought forward amendments during clause-by-clause, the government members voted them down.", "So you can talk a good talk over there, but at the end of the day, these women need more than two days of PEL.

We’ve heard it here a lot of times. I’ll say it again: It’s back to that training across the industry, even in our courts, so that sensitivity is there for when people go through these very traumatic events, not only for the victim but for their families, to recover fully.", "That is why events such as the gala, the walk and others help to raise awareness, recruit volunteers and funds to support the Women’s House in my riding.

Back in 2014, she put forward an opposition day motion on behalf of the PC caucus to strike the select committee that then worked to make recommendations to help prevent sexual violence and harassment. That committee, as she referenced, was struck in 2015. It went across the province studying. What we need to do is make sure that all of that effort is not in vain. We need to see action. This is like a lot of things we talk about in here: We study a lot and we spend a lot of money on things to understand the situation, but what do we do? Actions speak louder than words.", "I want to reinforce what my colleague from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke said when he rose to speak. It’s very important. If we’re truly going to be serious, if we really are going to be sincere and say that we want to make this a priority and have the resources for those people in times of sexual assault and violence, then we need to step up. We need the government to ensure that there’s proper funding all the way through the system: the proper training at the front end so that people are qualified and available when those things happen; we need the resources to be there so people have the facilities and resources available when they go through those traumatic situations; and that they actually have a safe place.", "That’s one of the things that my goddaughter Genielle Hay—she has been professionally trained. She went to school for this, and she’s going to hopefully to find a path in her career. It’s a very, very specific skill set to be able to work in these types of trying circumstances. I think we need to always ensure that they have the proper training, resources and support so that when these traumatic events happen in our lives, particularly to women who suffer at the hands of an abuser, we have them in our minds, that they have the ability to have comfort and support and a safe space so they know that we have them—that we are there for them in their time of need, and to ensure that those funding dollars are always going to meet the need at the time they need it in a very timely and compassionate way." ],

A very conservative estimate in this country is $78 million nationwide. You should not have to cost out the impact of domestic violence on women in 2017. We should not have to factor in what it’s going to cost to keep women and their children safe. I hope we can come to some consensus on that.", "I want to cite this report. This report is actually Economic Aspects of Paid Domestic Violence Leave Provisions. It was done by Jim Stanford, previously of Ontario, previously of Canada. This report says, “Any discussion of the incremental costs associated with measures to prevent domestic violence (like paid leave) must occur in the context of an understanding of the enormous economic costs (not to mention personal and social costs) associated with family and domestic violence. In this regard, the status quo is not ‘free.’”", "So what I want to say to this government is that the cost of apathy—the cost of taking small baby steps on a societal issue that affects every woman across this province, indirectly or directly—is too high. Do the right thing today and support this bill." ],

Mayor Bonnette and town council have done a great job of looking to the future, and together we’re asking the provincial government to partner with us in this process.”", "Mayor Bonnette stated this: “Responsible planning means it’s important that the town’s transportation agenda is advanced so as to best meet current and future needs. I’m pleased that our local provincial representative recognizes and supports our efforts to meet and manage the impacts that accompany designated growth targets.”", "Regional Chair Gary Carr wrote to me yesterday to add his voice in support. “We really need the minister to act,” Mr. Carr wrote.", "When Gary Carr and I were first elected to this House in 1990, it was not uncommon for MPPs to ask that a ministry do a study of a specific problem in their riding or area, seeking to quantify the depth and scope of the problem and identify possible solutions. If the request was sensible and reasonable, in many cases, provincial staff would be assigned to the task, a study would be commenced and undertaken, possible solutions would be identified, and a course of action would be charted. This is the kind of support we need from the Ministry of Transportation and the minister today.", "But this isn’t the first time we’ve asked. On numerous occasions in the past, the town of Halton Hills council and staff have made the point that the province needs to look at the traffic situation on Highway 7 through the town, especially given the fact that this highway seems to be the preferred east-west trucking route for aggregates between provincially identified aggregate resource areas and the high-growth areas of Brampton and north Toronto. As a member of provincial Parliament, I, too, have heard many complaints about the volume of truck traffic, most notably in Acton and Norval.", "Almost two years ago, the town of Halton Hills council passed a resolution on November 30, 2015, asking the province to partner with it on a long-term truck strategy, as they called it at the time. I supported their position and I went to work seeking a meeting with the Minister of Transportation on their behalf. After a few weeks, the meeting was set up, and on January 20, 2016, we met with the minister at his Queen’s Park boardroom and put the case for a partnership before him.", "The town offered to budget approximately $100,000 for the study and asked the ministry to do likewise. Other issues raised with the minister that day included the likely need for an Acton bypass because of extremely heavy truck traffic through downtown Acton, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the GTA West Corridor study and the resulting implications for Highway 7 and its associated connecting links through Acton, Georgetown and Norval. While the minister received us politely, seemed to listen and assured us he would review the concerns we’d raised, he did not commit to helping to pay for the needed study.", "We were disappointed but we were not deterred, for we in Wellington–Halton Hills never, ever give up. The mayor of Halton Hills and senior town staff have also followed up with the minister at the Association of Municipalities of Ontario—or AMO—at the AMO conferences in 2016 and 2017 and at yet another meeting with the minister on April 29, 2017, just a few months ago. I, too, have raised the issue many times and in many ways to support the town’s position. We’ve been told in response that the MTO staff believe that there is no technical justification to partner with the town on this. Again, with respect, we disagree.", "The town is so serious that they’ve decided to go ahead and commit their own funding for phase 1 of the truck strategy. The town continues to request that MTO partner on at least phase 2 of the work, to study the issue through and around Acton. This request was reiterated once again this past Monday night, in effect, when town council passed a motion explicitly supporting the private member’s resolution we are debating right now. Once again, we ask the Minister of Transportation to listen to this request and work with his staff to try to find a way to help.", "It seems appropriate at this point to mention that the Halton Hills Chamber of Commerce has expressed written support for our resolution. On September 20, the chamber’s general manager, Kathleen Dills, wrote this: “As an urban community built on major highways, congestion and safety are becoming critical issues, particularly when these highways intersect such as in the Acton downtown core.", "“Highway 7 is a major east-west option for trucks and we have seen the traffic significantly increasing every year. Our businesses need to have effective access to major markets they are serving to be competitive and cost-efficient, and access to the 401 corridor is critical. Our employees also need to be able to get to work quickly.”", "The Acton Business Improvement Area, or BIA, has weighed in as well in support of our resolution. Acton BIA manager Sheena Switzer added this: “Downtown Acton is located at a major crossroads of provincial Highways 7 and 25. Our downtown sees hundreds of large commercial trucks pass through its core. Residential and commercial growth is adding to the congestion along Highway 7, especially with commercial vehicles—we are a major east-west corridor for those wishing to avoid the 401.", "“Safety of our patrons, residents and business owners is paramount, as is the economic vitality of our downtown. Our windows rattle, streets are dusty and dirty from gravel trucks, and patrons are unable to have conversations on the street due to the extreme loudness of the trucks passing through. Sidewalk sales are a thing of the past, and our retail sector is struggling.” The Acton BIA supports our resolution, calling it “much needed.”", "Good points, representing the views of our business community. We see why an Acton bypass may be necessary and why we should begin to plan for it.", "There are other transportation issues in Halton Hills that need to be considered in the context of this debate. We need new jobs. Last December, Mayor Bonnette announced that Futura Properties had committed to a $30-million investment for a business development at a property known as 340 Main Street, Acton. This 55-acre site had previously sat idle for some 15 years, having been designated for industrial uses. And remember, Acton’s development has been limited by proximity to the greenbelt and a limited supply of water and sewage capacity.", "The region sought to help and has invested $44 million in infrastructure. This past summer, almost all of the necessary approvals were in place to see the first tenant in a 150,000-square-foot building by the end of this year, including the construction of a rail spur.", "However, having been kept apprised of the development all along and appearing to have few concerns, at the eleventh hour the MTO pulled the rug out from under town council due to, they said, issues associated with access to Highway 7 and the need for an environmental assessment study. It appears that the length of time that this would take possibly places the entire proposed development in jeopardy. I understand that MTO staff and town staff continue to meet to discuss this matter, and we’re hopeful of a positive resolution. But I urge the minister to take an interest in this. Again, we need those jobs.", "I need to mention the Halton-Peel Boundary Area Transportation Study, which was endorsed by town council in 2010 and was to address the commuter and truck traffic capacity issues on Highway 7 through Georgetown and Norval. A pause on the implementation of this study’s recommended north-south and east-west corridors by the participating municipalities was agreed to, pending the outcome of the ministry’s GTA West Corridor study, which had actually commenced around 2007.", "In December 2015, the MTO suspended the GTA west study, supposedly to have a panel review the progress to date and ensure it was consistent with other government policies and objectives. Almost two years later, we’re still waiting for the public release of the panel’s recommendations. The traffic problems in Georgetown and Norval continue to worsen, while at the same time the development of Halton Hills 401 employment lands are frozen, and again, the creation of jobs we need goes on hold. We need the minister’s help with this as well, as I was reminded yesterday by Councillor Bryan Lewis, who has been a strong supporter of a Norval bypass.", "I hope that during today’s debate, the government will update us on the progress they’ve made towards keeping their 2014 election commitment to all-day, two-way GO train service from Kitchener-Waterloo to Union Station with stops in Wellington-Halton Hills, something I’ve supported as well.", "I hope the government will acknowledge the important role that the town of Halton Hills had in the decision to widen 18 kilometres of the 401, from Mississauga to Milton, announced on April 10, which was a recommendation of the Hatch Mott MacDonald study that the town commissioned as a better option than building a new highway along the alternative 4-3 route, which the GTA West Corridor study had suggested and that town council and I had opposed.", "I hope the government will also respond to our request for traffic signals at the intersection of Guelph Street—Highway 7—and McFarlane Drive/Hall Road in Georgetown near the Sands condominium building, another transportation issue we’ve been raising for some time.", "In closing, I hope the government members present here today will vote for our resolution." ],

In fact, I could probably use my entire debate time this afternoon highlighting the list of investments our government has made in Waterloo region. I’ll just mention a couple of them today, including our $300-million investment in the ION LRT project; our work to widen Highway 401 from six to 10 lanes between Kitchener and Cambridge; and widening and realigning Shirley Avenue in advance of the Victoria Street bridge that’s going to come down and be rebuilt as a flyover for new Highway 7. These are just some of the investments that matter to my community.", "We know that fixing solutions to address truck traffic and the use of this stretch of highway that we’re talking about this afternoon as an aggregate haul route are top priorities for the community represented by the member for Wellington–Halton Hills. Speaker, I’m aware that the Minister of Transportation has met with officials in the town of Halton Hills on this very issue. They expressed concerns related to road safety and congestion. Our government knows just how important it is to listen to the needs of our local towns and cities and to take action where it is appropriate. That’s why we’re pleased to hear that in addition to meeting with town officials to hear their concerns, the Ministry of Transportation is currently an active participant in the feasibility study being led by the town of Halton Hills on this very issue. Most recently, the ministry attended a stakeholders’ workshop that took place in May of this year. It’s clear that the province is at the table on this issue.", "The town will be undertaking this important study in two separate phases. At this point in time, the town is currently moving forward on phase 1, which they expect to complete by the end of this year. Phase 1 is going to examine long-term transportation alternatives to accommodate truck traffic within Acton.", "I can assure the member, and every other member of this House, that the ministry is going to continue to actively participate in this study. Beyond that, I know that the ministry is going to carry out a thorough review of the results and assess appropriate next steps once this phase is complete. At that time, we’re going to need to see if there’s anything else that we can do at the provincial level to improve both the safety and the efficiency of this stretch of Highway 7.", "Speaker, beyond participating in this important study, we have supported and will continue to support the priorities of communities across the province, including Halton Hills. Highway 7 through Acton is a connecting link, and the government has just committed nearly $800,000 through the last two intakes of the Connecting Links Program.", "Our support does not stop there. We continue to support the town’s top priorities by initiating a study to address the need for traffic signals and improvements at the intersection of Main Street North and Highway 7, and by resurfacing three sections of the highway, which will be completed by the summer of 2018.", "So whether it’s investing in road projects or working with our municipal partners to address key concerns in their communities, our government has consistently shown that we are at the table.

So there is a history of success with this particular MPP. I should probably study his playbook a little more carefully, because many of us have these challenges in our communities.", "I remember very well when then-Premier Ernie Eves announced some provincial funding for the Orangeville bypass and the Bolton bypass. I can tell you, those were game-changers. We now have two vibrant downtown communities that are not dealing with truck traffic, that were able to rebuild their economic core and, frankly, their livability because the truck traffic and the through traffic, which had no interest in stopping, was not bogging up our downtowns anymore.", "I’m challenged now, locally, with Shelburne. Many of you in the chamber would know that Shelburne has Highway 10 and Highway 89 as part of the provincial highway system within its borders. It becomes very, very challenging for people who are trying to shop and visit and be part of those communities because, frankly, the traffic that just wants to get through is in a hurry and there’s too much of it. It has been a real danger. We had a near-fatality this summer, with a woman with a walker attempting to cross. She got hit by a truck that was in a hurry.", "Anything we can do to pull together these strategies to ensure that our communities are able to be strong and safe, I think, are noble causes.

They’ve made transportation a key priority, and this bill is in front of us because the council needs a provincial partner. They have a provincial partner in Mr. Arnott, but they also need a government partner.", "His riding is in a high-growth area, partially because of the Places to Grow strategy introduced by the Liberal government. Not only have the mayor and council planned for this future growth, but they’ve done so in a responsible manner. They have the growth targets. They know how to get there. They realize the impacts these goals will have on the traffic patterns, and the increase in traffic volumes that will be generated. They are also very cognizant of the safety concerns that this increase in traffic will generate.", "They don’t want to turn their backs on the economic development potential that’s just over the horizon, so they need to look at innovative partnerships with the province. For example, they’re calling for a review of the need for a bypass on Highway 7 at Acton. While increased development can be a good thing, it can bring a lot more of those big, heavy transport trucks to the area. That’s a safety issue unto itself. Road patterns, road load restrictions, traffic signals and traffic speeds all come into play.", "They have a shopping list: Highway 7 through Halton Hills, the Acton bypass, and that proposed new business development on Main Street in Acton. Don’t forget the transportation study that affects Norval, Georgetown and the Halton-Peel boundary area and, of course, the widening of the 401. And they say you might as well toss in there the all-day, two-way GO train, that service back and forth to Union Station with stops in Halton Hills. If that’s not enough, and if I have this right, they also want to remind us of the need for a stoplight at that Guelph Street/McFarlane Drive/Hall Road intersection in Georgetown.", "That’s quite the wish list, and I hope they do well.

Speaker, most of the members here remember Bruce Crozier, the former MPP for Essex. He spent 18 years in this House. Sadly, Bruce passed away suddenly, just a few days after he retired six years ago.

I always had great respect for Bruce. We called him “the tomato king.” The Liberals have turned their backs on him. That’s despite the fact that there are many—far too many—serious and deadly accidents on that stretch of highway every year. That highway connects the farming communities in Essex county and the hundreds of transport trucks needed to haul fresh produce daily to markets in the United States. It’s also a major route for the thousands of tourists attracted to our wineries, beaches and small towns, and Point Pelee National Park. Of course, we have thousands of people living in the county but working in Windsor or Detroit, and folks living in Windsor but working in the county. In other words, it’s a very busy and very dangerous stretch of highway.", "The transportation minister has seen it.

It’s an example that all of us should want to follow.", "The people of Wellington–Halton Hills are fortunate to have an experienced MPP who knows how to get things done, even in opposition.", "That’s what he did on another infrastructure project in his riding. For years, he lobbied the government to approve the Morriston bypass on Highway 6. Finally, in March of this year, they approved it. I have no doubt that the member’s advocacy went a long way in getting to that stage.", "Now we just need to see some shovels in the ground. There are so many reasons we should support this resolution and the project it mentions.", "But before I get into those reasons, I want to remind everyone of my resolution which we debated almost two years ago. It stated that the government should guarantee that government-held and opposition-held ridings be given equal and transparent consideration on infrastructure funding. It passed with support from all parties.", "If this government is looking at which infrastructure projects to support, and if they are doing so with equal and transparent consideration, and if they are doing so based not on politics but rather on the merits, it’s obvious that the member for Wellington–Halton Hills has made a very compelling case.", "Halton Hills is a fast-growing community. The time for a long-term transportation strategy is now—not years from now, after traffic gets worse.", "The Halton Hills Chamber of Commerce writes, “As an urban community built on major highways, congestion and safety are becoming critical issues, particularly when these highways intersect such as in the Acton downtown core.”", "I also represent communities where provincial highways run through them and, in many cases, intersect. We need the province to properly maintain those highways and expand them where necessary, because municipalities cannot be expected to do it on their own. They need the province to be a partner, and they need the province to pony up the cash. They need to see it for what it is: a necessary investment in our long-term prosperity.", "The Halton Hills Chamber of Commerce makes the same point. Their letter states, “Highway 7 is a major east-west option for trucks and we have seen the traffic ... increasing every year. Our businesses need to have effective access to major markets they are serving to be competitive and cost-efficient, and access to the 401 corridor is critical. Our employees also need to be able to get to work quickly.”", "They’re right. The resolution is not asking for a luxury. It’s not asking for a political monument. It’s not pressuring Metrolinx to fast-track a shiny new GO station in Vaughan. No, this resolution is instead calling on the government to recognize an economic necessity. It’s calling on the government to bring relief to a corridor serving not just one riding, but the entire region.", "Again, I congratulate the member for Wellington–Halton Hills for effectively representing his constituents, and I thank him for advocating for something that will produce economic benefits for years to come." ],

Looking at the motion, I see the member raising issues we hear right across the province of Ontario: the need for better transportation support for our communities.", "As far as I understand it, the mayor of Halton Hills supports this motion. I also support this motion to study the transportation issues in the town of Halton Hills and, of course, in the member’s riding. Madam Speaker, as always, I have no doubt that the mayor entirely understands what’s happening on the ground in his community. This is always the case in the province of Ontario. Mayors and councillors are on the ground every day and they see the transportation issues every single day. You can see the pictures of congestion and the trucks backed up on Highway 7 that prove that what the mayor is saying is true.", "But I believe a study would prove exactly what the local representatives have been saying: that the province needs to address transportation issues. So if it’s a study that’s required to make this happen, then I’m proud to support him in sending in some experts and producing a report which outlines exactly what those needs are.", "Madam Speaker, I can’t stress this enough: We’re hearing these concerns right across the province of Ontario. In fact, some of these concerns come from my own riding. I know that the town of Halton Hills is advocating for all-day, two-way GO train service to Union Station. In Niagara, we are proud that we’re working across party lines and we have secured the GO train coming to Niagara. The GO train running into Niagara Falls by 2023 is a good thing that we’re very proud of, but we would be a lot prouder if we could get it sooner. Niagara will be hosting the 2021 Canada Summer Games. There is no reason we can’t push this forward and do everything we can to get Niagara Falls a GO train by the time of these important games.", "Madam Speaker, when I look at the issues that have been raised by Halton Hills, there are a lot of parallels to what I have just raised. Economic development follows when transportation routes flow smoothly and freely. Right now, if you drive to Toronto, it’s almost three hours to drive from Niagara, and almost two hours of that is sitting in traffic. It’s not very good for the environment either. People working in Hamilton sometimes have to wait an hour and a half or two hours just to get to work. If people can drive in a reasonable amount of time, they can live in Niagara in their homes, where they can contribute to our wonderful community, while keeping jobs that provide for their families. So we want to get this province moving quickly. We need to act on public transit options like the ones we’re discussing today.", "I hope the members opposite are listening. We can work together. We can get a GO train to Niagara a lot quicker than 2023, so let’s get it down.", "Madam Speaker, as you can see, I’m a passionate supporter of sensible transit strategies. So when a community from Halton Hills is talking about issues with traffic on Highway 7, the need for traffic signals and the need to reduce congestion, let’s support that community and study their issues. Let’s find the facts and let’s make decisions based on sensible policy. That’s why I’m proud to support the motion today.", "Of course, it should be said that when we were fighting to get GO train service to Niagara in 2014, the Conservatives opposed that. They wouldn’t support us.", "Interjection." ],

The May long weekend commemorates Queen Victoria, but in many parts of the province, the day off in August is referred to by the somewhat uninspiring moniker of Civic Holiday.", "John Graves Simcoe founded Toronto. That city recognizes Simcoe by naming the first Monday Simcoe Day.", "This private members’ bill, titled Simcoe Day Act, is intended to bring some awareness of what Simcoe had accomplished. Some might interpret this bill as mandating municipalities to adopt or change their local recognition of what they’ve named in the past—for example, Ottawa’s Colonel By Day or Burlington’s Joseph Brant Day—but this legislation does not do that.", "The proposed legislation, under my direction and according to legal counsel who drafted the bill, is voluntary. It only proclaims the first Monday in August. I do repeat that those municipalities who already have the first Monday in August recognized will not be affected and those municipalities that wish to opt out down the road can do so, if they so choose.", "Just to be sure, I had an opportunity this week to revise the bill to read as such: “The first Monday in August in each year is proclaimed as Simcoe Day, unless a bylaw of a municipality specifies otherwise for the municipality.”", "If you have been around Burlington for any length of time, you would be familiar with the name Joseph Brant, a Mohawk military and political leader of the late 1700s. Burlington has the first Monday in August in his honour.", "Closely related, Emancipation Day, established in Ontario in 2008, falls on August 1. Many will know that John Graves Simcoe banned the importation of slaves into what is now Ontario back in 1793.", "During my research, I developed quite an appreciation or an admiration for John Graves Simcoe, his leadership of the Queen’s Rangers against George Washington’s army and his creation of core institutions that anchor the success of present-day Ontario. He was born February 25, 1752—265 years ago—in England. John Graves Simcoe, although best known as Ontario’s first Lieutenant Governor, was also a member of British Parliament. He was a colonial administrator, an army officer—as I mentioned, commander of the Queen’s Rangers during the Revolutionary War.", "At age 24, Simcoe did go to war in America to fight the revolutionaries. His regiment arrived from Britain in June 1775 to take part in the siege of Boston, two days after the Battle of Bunker Hill. Simcoe assumed command of the elite Queen’s Rangers on October 15, 1777, which was largely composed of Loyalists and deserters from George Washington’s army. The Queen’s Rangers were named in tribute to Queen Charlotte, the wife of King George III. It was a 400-man elite fighting force, first established in the Seven Years’ War from 1756 to 1763. They trained in woodcraft, scouting and guerrilla warfare.", "Simcoe didn’t follow the protocol of the time of strict and rigid manoeuvres. The Rangers wore green uniforms for camouflage, depended on speed and surprise, and were known to defeat forces three times their size.", "Simcoe and his Rangers fought alongside Benedict Arnold at Richmond and, in the winter of 1779, spared the life of Washington himself by allowing Washington and several others to escape without firing upon them.", "Simcoe was wounded several times during battle. He had his horse shot out from under him. He was held a prisoner of war and then was paroled by Benjamin Franklin.", "Simcoe took the time from the war to pursue a young lady named Sarah “Sally” Townsend. On February 14, 1779, he sent her a poem in which he extolled her beauty and his love for her. This is the first recorded Valentine’s Day letter in North America.", "Following the defeat of the British at Yorktown in 1781, Simcoe spirited the Queen’s Rangers colours to England. Today, they’re on display in the officers’ mess of the Queen’s Rangers here at Fort York in Toronto.", "There’s a television production out there on AMC called Turn. So far, the most villainous villain in this series is Captain Simcoe, played by Samuel Roukin. One of AMC’s behind-the-scenes promotional videos features the creator, Craig Silverstein, telling us that there’s something a little wrong with Simcoe. Roukin describes him as basically a sociopath. Speaker, I consider this an egregious example of betrayal of Simcoe through character assassination—oftentimes the silver screen, in portraying war, does require a villain.", "Going back to the Revolutionary War: When it wrapped up, Simcoe returned to England, married Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim and was elected member of Parliament for the borough of St. Mawes in Cornwall. Lady Simcoe left a valuable record of life in Upper Canada through her letters and her diary. She was an accomplished water colourist and a sketch artist. She skillfully chronicled her travels in Upper Canada.", "Going back, as we know, on September 12, 1791, Simcoe was appointed Lieutenant Governor of the newly created Upper Canada. With his appointment, he articulated a goal to develop Upper Canada as a model community with aristocratic and conservative principles and to demonstrate the superiority of these ideas in contrast to the republicanism of the United States.", "The first session of the first Parliament opened on September 17, 1791, with the presentation of the speech from the throne by Lieutenant Governor Simcoe. The first action of the House of Assembly was to elect unanimously John McDonell as Speaker. McDonell was a veteran of Colonel John Butler’s Rangers and the representative sent from Glengarry. Present-day MPP Jim McDonell has a close connection, and I’m a descendant of John Butler. I carry his middle name.", "Just to back up a bit again: The Constitutional Act of June 10, 1791, divided the British colony into two governments: west of the Ottawa River, Upper Canada; the lower reaches of the St. Lawrence became Lower Canada. But we did not see Ontario’s first Parliament meet until a year later, at Newark, now Niagara-on-the-Lake. It sat under the great seal and mace of Upper Canada that were created in 1791.", "Those elected to the House of Assembly for the first Parliament were representative of the colony. Most arrived after the American Revolution. They served in the militia, the regular forces and were fiercely loyal to Great Britain and the monarchy. The appointed legislative councillors of Upper Canada, unlike the elected settlers, tended to come from the British Isles and were chosen partly for their success in business or government.", "Several important acts were passed: English civil law, trial by jury, the building of a courthouse and a jail in every district, and the introduction of a standard system of weights and measures.", "Within days, Ephraim Jones of Grenville had introduced legislation calling for the establishment of trial by jury and the destruction of wolves. Jeremiah French of Stormont wanted better regulation of surveyors, their fees and jurisdiction.", "Some things haven’t changed: Taxes were proposed on wine and spirits, and anti-smuggling legislation was introduced.", "The new Legislature authorized town meetings, laid the structure for municipal government, and, significantly, a year later, in 1793, Simcoe’s Legislative Council passed An Act to prevent the further introduction of Slaves and to limit the term of contracts for servitude within this Province—the first such legislation in the British Empire. Settlers in the capital were mostly refugees from the American War of Independence, veterans of Butler’s Rangers, and Loyalists with their families. They arrived along with their indentured servants or their slaves.", "After 1793, a slave entering Upper Canada would be free, and children born to slaves after 1793 became free at age 25. They were treated equally under the law and the government, their vote was sought in elections, they won lawsuits, their children attended public schools and they were able to buy houses.", "It remains unclear exactly where the first sitting of this Legislature was held. Cases are made for Navy Hall, Butler’s Barracks, the Masonic Lodge, and a large marquee tent pitched under what is now known as Parliament Oak. Simcoe soon realized that Newark was an unsuitable capital because it was on the border and open to attack. He recommended moving it to a defensible position, and named the location London and renamed the river the Thames. This proposal was rejected, like a lot of his ideas, by Britain. But Simcoe’s second choice, the present site of Toronto, was accepted. The capital was moved there in 1793 and renamed York.", "On September 17, 1992—let’s fast-forward—130 MPPs went by bus to the place where our first provincial Parliament convened to commemorate the 200th anniversary. Attended by Bob Rae, Lyn McLeod, Mike Harris and Lieutenant Governor Henry Jackman, they planted a tree and they retired for tea at Navy Hall.", "To wrap up, John Graves Simcoe lived his life by the family coat of arms, “Non sibi sed patriae,” which means, “Not for self but for country.” This is the motto of my alma mater, Simcoe district high school, and all of our sports jerseys had that Latin inscription on them. Every kid in that school knows that Latin phrase." ],

  "text" : [ "I rise today to speak to Bill 159, the Simcoe Day Act. This act would make the first Monday in August of the year Simcoe Day in Ontario. To talk about this act, I thought I should answer two questions: First, why is it important to celebrate Simcoe Day? Secondly, why is John Graves Simcoe’s legacy worth recognizing?", "To answer the first question, “Why is it important to celebrate Simcoe Day?”: To start, I should say that I’m not usually one to use flowery language to describe conservatives; however, I will make an exception for Simcoe. Simcoe had quite an interesting resumé. He was a writer, a British member of Parliament, a soldier and commander, a founder of Toronto and the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, what is today Ontario. His impact on life at the end of the 18th century in Upper Canada makes him a character that is worth learning about.", "There was one that stood out in my mind especially. It might be more of a legend than a fact, but I think it’s still worth talking about. During the American Revolution, Simcoe fought in the British army. At the time, the British were fighting the patriots of the 13 colonies. These patriots had wanted the 13 colonies to be independent from Britain. During the Battle of Brandywine, Simcoe commanded the 40th battalion. At the end of the battle, Simcoe stopped his soldiers from firing on three fleeing patriots, and it is said that George Washington was one of those three soldiers. This made me think that, along with Ontario, maybe the United States should be celebrating Simcoe Day. After all, he did end up being the Founding Father, and we helped him escape from the Battle of Brandywine.", "There are many stories of Simcoe that made me want to learn more about him. I think the celebration of Simcoe Day can do exactly that: It can inspire young students to learn more. That is why it is important to celebrate Simcoe Day.", "To the second question, “Why is Simcoe’s legacy worth recognizing?”: I was also pleased to discover that Simcoe made great contributions to the society of Upper Canada. We wouldn’t be in the Legislature today if it weren’t for Simcoe. He decided to make the new capital of Upper Canada York, or, as we say today, Toronto. He also ordered the creation of Yonge Street for the purpose of settling rural parts of southern Ontario.", "But beyond these more well-known facts, I also wanted to draw attention to the most important and progressive feat of them all: Simcoe believed in ending slavery. I actually came across a quote of his, before he was the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada—a long time ago: “The principles of the British Constitution do not admit of that slavery which Christianity condemns.... The moment I assume the government of Upper Canada under no modification will I assent to a law that discriminates by dishonest policy between natives of Africa, America or Europe.” I was inspired to read those words from Simcoe believing in ending slavery—a man far before his time.", "But he did more than speak out against it. He worked hard to change Upper Canada’s slavery laws. In Simcoe’s time, the Upper Canadian Legislature was made up of two bodies: the elected Legislative Assembly, and the Legislative Council appointed by Simcoe. Many of those in these two councils were slave owners. This made it difficult to push forward legislation that would abolish slavery. However, Simcoe persevered.", "Certain events began to shift the public mindset. This allowed Simcoe to be able to convince both legislative bodies to phase out slavery in Upper Canada. The new law made it so that no new slaves could be brought in from outside of Upper Canada and that children born to slaves after the law was passed would become free at the age of 25. It was a compromise, but an effective one.", "Simcoe’s 1793 Act Against Slavery would become the first slavery-abolishing law passed anywhere in the British Empire. Due to this act, Upper Canada would have no slaves remaining by the time the British Empire fully abolished slavery in 1833. Essentially, Simcoe’s position led to the end of slavery in Upper Canada, and it also had larger effects for slaves in the United States. Without Upper Canada’s early end to slavery, Toronto would have never become the destination for many taking the Underground Railroad. Simcoe’s stance likely saved the lives of many, many African Americans.", "Simcoe was taking the progressive path here. He took action a good 30 years before Britain officially ended slavery and a good 60 years before the United States ended slavery. Simcoe should be seen as someone who took the right position before it was agreed upon. In my mind, there is no better reason to celebrate Simcoe than to recognize this important feat.", "To conclude, John Graves Simcoe is an interesting character in Ontario history who accomplished many good things. He deserves to be remembered. What better way to remember him than for our province to make the first Monday in August Simcoe Day? I encourage all of you to support Bill 159." ],

After his father’s death, Simcoe returned to Britain to be educated. Upon completing his education, he decided to pursue a military career. He returned to North America because of the American Revolutionary War in 1775 as part of the British forces. In October 1777, he took command of the Queen’s Rangers with the rank of major. During this time, he achieved great personal success and a reputation as a tactical theorist.", "Finally, he was forced to retreat back to England, but not before becoming a lieutenant colonel. After briefly serving in the British Parliament, he was commissioned on the 12th of September, 1791, to become the first Lieutenant Governor of what was known as Upper Canada.", "He first made Newark, which is now known as Niagara-on-the-Lake, the capital of Upper Canada. However, he anticipated the risk of further hostilities between Britain and the United States. Simcoe determined that Newark was a strategically poor choice for a provincial capital, so he moved the provincial capital from Niagara-on-the-Lake, which was known at that time as Newark, to the city of York, which is today known as Toronto—one of the greatest cities on this planet, Madam Speaker.", "In the first-ever legislative session, Simcoe managed to pass a bill establishing British civil law, trial by jury, the use of British Winchester standards of measure, and a provision for jails and courthouses in the province of Ontario, or, in those days, Upper Canada.", "Most notably, Simcoe passed an act against slavery on July 9, 1793, something that should rightly be celebrated and commemorated. This act not only ended the sale of slaves by Canadians to Americans; it also liberated slaves entering Upper Canada from the US.", "Lord Simcoe stood in opposition to the sentiment of the day. He was also incredibly courageous, as he risked retribution not only from Americans but from his own colleagues at the Ontario Legislative Assembly who owned slaves in those days. However, after this legislation was enacted, he took pride in not only his distinction, but all of Upper Canada as well. “Under no modification will I assent to a law that discriminates by dishonest policy between natives of Africa, America or Europe,” John Simcoe said. In fact, this legislation came 40 years before the Slavery Abolition Act which would outlaw slavery in most of the British Empire.", "We are proud to see, Madam Speaker, that we were on the right side of history and that Canada and Ontario have contributed to the tradition of being progressive and to celebrate its diversity.", "The town of Simcoe, of course, is named after him, as is Simcoe county. Schools and streets throughout our province of Ontario are named after him, in all corners of the province. He has a statue right outside at Queen’s Park.", "It is clear that he had a lasting impact on Ontarians and should rightfully be considered an historic figure. We can learn from him and honour him. That is why I am so pleased, as well as my government and members of the Legislature from the Liberal Party, in supporting this bill." ],

I am, however, going to use the time available to me to give a slightly different approach to this measure today, and that is to talk, as well, about the life of Elizabeth Posthuma Simcoe, because I think that, as we all know, behind every successful man—but also particularly in the situation that she found herself in in the late part of that century.", "While my colleague has a town in his community called Simcoe, I have a region, a lake and several towns with Simcoe connections, so to say that I was keen to speak on this bill would in fact be an understatement.", "Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to attend the 225th anniversary of the opening of Canada’s first Parliament by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe. It was a special opportunity to celebrate our democratic history. John Graves Simcoe played a key role in creating the first formal structures of democracy for our country, and while our capital has moved and town names have changed, his influence is present to this day.", "But we cannot recognize the contribution of John Graves Simcoe without raising and recognizing the many contributions of Mrs. Simcoe. Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim was born in the village of Whitchurch in England. Her middle name was a nod to her father, who died just before her birth. Unfortunately, her mother died shortly after her birth. People in my community may find that Gwillim and Whitchurch sound familiar, and I will touch on that shortly.", "She went on to marry John Graves Simcoe and had four daughters and one son. That son, Francis, is for whom Castle Frank is named.", "Elizabeth painted beautiful watercolours, hundreds of which are carefully preserved by Archives Ontario. These watercolours give us a glimpse of the untouched beauty and early beginnings of Quebec, Niagara, Georgina, York—now Toronto—Kingston, Gananoque and the Magdalen Islands. But more than showing us what they looked like, she left us a diary.", "First published in 1934, her diary provides a valuable and colourful illustration of life in the early days in colonial Canada. Her writing style is clear and, while perhaps not exactly how we would write today, it is easy to understand. In May 1792 or 1793, Elizabeth suffered a mosquito bite while in the Niagara area:", "“I suffered exquisite pain all the day from a mosquito bite, which the extreme heat increased, and at night my sleeve was obliged to be cut open. I did not see any rattlesnakes, though many ladies are afraid to go to the Table Rock, as it is said there are many of these snakes near it. There are crayfish in small pools of water. Mr. McDonnell said that pounded crayfish applied to the wound was a cure for the bite of rattlesnakes.”", "That August, Mr. and Mrs. Simcoe dined with Major and Mrs. Smith, where Elizabeth made some interesting observations about tame raccoons:", "“Mrs. Smith has two tame racoons. These resemble a fox, are exceedingly fat animals with bushy tails. When they eat they use their forefeet, as monkeys do. I also saw a flying squirrel, which I did not admire. Its tail was like a rat’s, and the eyes very large. I thought the ground squirrel much prettier. The black squirrel is large and quite black. It is as good to eat as a young rabbit.”", "Her observations formed quite a book, with observations of day-to-day life and, of course, the political goings-on. But it is the smaller details about daily life that captured my attention. Elizabeth was an heiress who came from a well-regarded family with deep ties to the nobility throughout the ages, and remember, her father died before she was born and her mother died a few days after she was born.", "She was raised as a wealthy heiress who came from a well-regarded family, with deep ties to the nobility. As a child, she was a gifted painter and linguist, speaking English, French, German and Spanish. You can only imagine the opulence that she grew up in, surrounded by governesses and the like, and here she is as an adult, living life in a tent on the frontier, far from the comforts of home. She was more than simply the wife; she was John Simcoe’s partner in their adventure to Canada. We were so lucky to have her paintings and diary to reference when we study and consider life in her time.", "She chose the name Scarborough for an area east of York that bears both her husband’s name and hers. The town of Whitchurch, which is today known as Whitchurch-Stouffville, was in my previous riding of Durham–York when I represented that. Gwillimbury is named for her maiden name, Gwillim, and thus North, East and West Gwillimbury are lasting symbols of her impact in the community. In 2007, a statue of Elizabeth was erected in the town of Bradford-West Gwillimbury to commemorate the 150th anniversary. If you are interested in visiting, she can be found in front of the post office in the town of Bradford.", "There’s much more that we can say about her, but she certainly made a tremendous contribution to life in Upper Canada." ],

I know that he is a great admirer of our history, and I’m happy to support his efforts here.", "I think it is certainly correct that both John Graves Simcoe and his wife, Lady Simcoe, are both early residents worth remembering and that our future generations should learn about. So much that we recognize about our province came from Simcoe’s first Parliament and was given to future generation through the incredible writings of his wife, things like the creation of municipalities, the implementation of trial by jury and, of course, his landmark bill to abolish the importation of slaves into Canada.", "By establishing a day in memory of John Graves Simcoe, we can continue to teach our future generations the stories of who we are and where we came from, a story of lives that intertwine between settlers like Governor Simcoe and the First Nations of the land he came to. It’s a story that would talk about the structures he created to ensure our democracy is alive and vibrant today, but that would also tell of some of his policies which perhaps did not benefit all Canadians or that some may disagree with. Only with true stories and full stories of these figures can we properly commemorate those who built our wonderful province.", "As many of you know, John Graves Simcoe’s life intersected with the history of a town in my riding called Niagara-on-the-Lake. During his time, it was called Newark, and at that time, it was the capital of Upper Canada.", "There’s a reason I know this history and a reason why I can stand so proudly in this House today and recite the history to you: It’s because of the residents of my community. The residents of Niagara-on-the-Lake strive to keep their history not only in memory but alive and vibrant. The amount of time and dedication they give back to our community to ensure our future generations know about our past is truly incredible.", "I can think of no better example of that than the 225th anniversary of the first sitting of the Legislature that took place in Niagara-on-the-Lake on September 17. For over nine months, dedicated residents from the town came together to work tirelessly so we could celebrate the first sitting of this Legislature in 1792. It’s why we should all be honoured to be here every day that people send us here upon being elected. We are not entirely certain of the exact location of that gathering, although Navy Hall, the Commons and the area known as Parliament Oak are likely suspects. But we do know that what the original representatives did set in motion were our democratic traditions that carry on to this day.", "The committee worked long hours and lobbied MPPs from every party in this House to come to Niagara-on-the-Lake and be part of that celebration. Madam Speaker, I’m proud to say it worked. It was a day where party affiliation didn’t matter. It was a day where we put aside our disagreements and came together to support the residents, and to learn a little bit of our history. I’m proud to say that my friend from Haldimand–Norfolk was not only there for that, but he actually came bearing arms—and you know what I’m talking about. The LG came. The Speaker of the House came. To all the members in this House who came: From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you.", "But my biggest thank you goes to members from my community. I want to thank Dr. Richard Merritt, Patti Knipe, Dr. Wes Turner and Terry Bolton. Those four played an instrumental role in getting our Niagara Gazette off the ground, which was the historic paper we circulated to the guests and to the whole town. It was absolutely beautiful and truly unique.", "I want to thank Barbara Worthy, who is the playwright who wrote our plays for the Canada 150 events.

Without her around-the-clock work, none of these events would have been possible or come together as perfectly as they did.", "Again, thank you to everyone who helped to plan these events and everyone who came.", "Madam Speaker, I can’t say enough.

It’s a day when people come from all over Niagara to learn a little bit about their forefathers and foremothers of this country.", "I want to close: It’s where we come to learn about where we come from and where we are going as a community, as province and as a people.

I’m delighted because I am a supporter and I will support the bill.", "I was particularly pleased with the line of debate that the member from York–Simcoe was going down on, because I too wanted to talk about Lady Simcoe and what an extraordinary figure she was. All these great paintings, these historical representations we have of our indigenous, First Nations people of Ontario, come from so many of her watercolours at the time. We have many here in the Legislature. They’re fantastic. I kind of thought where she was going was maybe to propose an amendment to make it Lady Simcoe Day. We don’t have enough women who are being recognized on official days like that, and I thought that would have been a very interesting way to go. We could honour John Graves Simcoe with Lady Simcoe having this day of honour. That’s not the case, but what we have before us is this opportunity.", "I was also pleased to see in the member’s bill an exemption for municipalities that have a bylaw on the books that name it something differently, because I grew up in the city of Toronto, where the bylaw says that it is Simcoe Day. So I grew up experiencing Simcoe Day on a regular basis. That’s what we called the Civic Holiday; it was Simcoe Day. I think that started in 1969, and it was a few years later that a motion in front of AMO to have Simcoe Day applied to all municipalities across the province of Ontario failed. But in Toronto, it continues.", "What’s important about that is that AMO was recognizing that many, many municipalities took the Civic Holiday and made it their own. That’s why it’s important in the bill here that we have this exemption for municipalities, and I appreciate the foresight of the member putting that forward.", "You think about those other days that municipalities have taken—Colonel By Day in Ottawa, for instance. They named expressways after him. It’s extraordinary—Colonel By Day. In Hamilton, it’s George Hamilton Day. In Burlington, it’s Joseph Brant Day; Founders Day in Brantford; McLaughlin Day in Ottawa—I think he was a president of General Motors Canada at one point; Alexander Mackenzie Day in Sarnia; James Cockburn Day in Cobourg; Peter Robinson Day in Peterborough; and John Galt Day in Guelph.", "We have a rich history in municipalities. The fact that we have that exemption is one of those recognitions as a provincial Legislature—we recognize the richness of our municipalities and we give them that kind of flexibility.", "What I also wanted to address at this point is, as I said earlier, I stare at two portraits: Simcoe and Tecumseh, two great heroes. And I ask the question: whether we should be naming another day and having another monument to a European white male.", "In the days of reconciliation, of all the things we’ve come to believe that we need to do to respect our indigenous First Nations in the province of Ontario, what if it were actually called Tecumseh Day, in recognition of the work that Tecumseh did—side by side with Simcoe—to defend us against the Americans? Now, Tecumseh wasn’t born in Canada, but then neither was Simcoe. He was a Brit. Tecumseh was born in the United States of America, where he made his history before joining forces and then coming up here and defeating the Americans on Canadian soil.", "It wouldn’t be fair in the spirit of reconciliation if we didn’t recognize some of Simcoe’s failings with respect to his treatment of indigenous people in the province of Ontario. He was a great believer in agriculture—a great believer in the concept of giving people land to make them loyal to the place that he was governing. So Simcoe gave large tracts of land to various people in the province—" ],

Let’s just think about that for a second: We’re living where most people in the world would like to live. This did not happen by accident. It’s the result of generations of hard-working men and women who came together to develop the Canada that we see today.", "John Graves Simcoe was one of those who truly left a mark on this country. He left the relative comfort of England to travel to a hostile land across the ocean, leaving friends and family behind, to fight for his country—an example followed by many generations of Canadians up till today.", "His leadership qualities led him to quickly rise through the ranks to command the Queen’s Rangers. After the American Revolution, he moved back to England and was elected as a member of Parliament.", "His accomplishments were acknowledged and he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of the newly created Upper Canada on September 12, 1791. He quickly set about to create a region that was a model community and one that became the basis of this great country of ours.", "Under an act of British Parliament he saw that elections were held in August 1792 to elect a 16-member House of the Assembly. As Lieutenant Governor, John Simcoe called the assembly together for the first meeting of the new Legislature on Monday, September 17, 1792.", "Under his agenda, he ensured that several important acts were passed by the first Parliament, including the establishment of English civil law and trial by jury, the abolition of slavery, the division of the province into 17 counties and districts and the building of a courthouse and jail in each one of them; and the introduction of a standard system of weights and measures.", "Speaker, defence of our young country was top of mind for the Lieutenant Governor. Upper Canada was a harsh environment, sparsely populated by our First Nations and by newly settled pioneers who barely had time to establish their farms to provide food and homes to provide shelter. The land was harsh, with mountains, swamps and forests, and the climate was severe. And our neighbour to the south had almost a 200-year head start and were clearly a threat. As the leader of this new Upper Canada, he had to work with peoples of different ethnic backgrounds, faiths and origins—many who had fought against each other not too long before that. He brought these peoples together, putting their differences aside for a common good: the building and the defence of a new home, a new country. He quickly forged this rough, young nation into a force to be reckoned with and, as history would show, one ready to withstand invasion from what many assumed would be far superior armed forces. He identified that the capital, in what is today’s Niagara-on-the-Lake, was open to attack and he was instrumental in moving it to York, known today as the city of Toronto.", "Speaker, we have much to be thankful for today, and we must remember the courageous men and women of yesterday who can stand side by side and take credit for the building of this great country and for the mark it has left on our modern world.", "John Graves Simcoe was one of those great Canadians. We can safely say that he lived his life by the inscription on the family coat of arms: “Not for self, but for country.”", "To paraphrase former Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper, our country was built on the backs of giants, and John Simcoe was truly a giant of our history.", "We have much to be thankful for and many people to remember.", "I support this bill by the member from Haldimand–Norfolk to mark the first Monday in August as Simcoe Day." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to rise to speak on Bill 154, the Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act, 2017. The Whitby Chamber of Commerce often tells me that for a small business to succeed, it’s crucial to have a legislative framework that focuses on reducing, not adding to, the regulatory burden, allowing businesses to focus on what they do best: innovate, expand and, most importantly, create jobs.", "Businesses in the Whitby–Oshawa riding tell me that red tape shifts their focus away from growing their business. Spending time, energy and resources filling out excessive paperwork or jumping through bureaucratic provincial hoops impedes small and large businesses alike in that area.", "The regulatory burden can be especially difficult for small businesses to adhere to, given that they have much smaller staffs compared to larger businesses, but they’re still bound by the same regulatory framework. This means that small business owners must turn to consultants for help. In turn, this makes the costs of running their businesses go up and profit margins diminish.", "The Canadian Federation of Independent Business cites excessive red tape as the second-highest priority of their members, after taxes. In fact, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business has estimated that the cost of regulation in Ontario has grown from $12.8 billion to $4.7 billion between 2005 and 2014.", "Speaker, the former president and chief executive officer of TD Bank Group, Ed Clark, said:", "“Ontario has 380,000 regulatory requirements for business, almost double the number in some provinces.", "“While the number is staggering, the structure and complexity of compliance is even more problematic. It makes us less competitive. We are seen by foreigners—and even ourselves—as a slow place to do business.”", "Ontario needs to be seen as a place which has the processes for businesses to succeed and create jobs, and one that encourages investment, both domestic and foreign. Measures such as less time filling out paperwork will make it easier for Ontario businesses to focus on what they do best: growing their business and creating jobs, and in turn growing Ontario’s economy.", "Let’s turn for a moment, Speaker, to the report from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, which focused on red tape. The report criticized the regulatory regime in Ontario and the fragile consultative process with businesses in the development of provincial regulations. I’d like to quote the report:", "“Business is too often viewed primarily as the object of regulation, rather than an equal partner in the creation of innovative, productivity-enhancing systems and procedures for achieving improved ... outcomes.”", "On stakeholder consultations, the government should move “towards a more productive and reciprocal relationship with business that will allow it to reconcile the act of regulation with the principle of economic sustainability.”", "Finally, Speaker, the chamber’s report made eight recommendations to the government, and this afternoon I’d like to highlight in particular two of those recommendations, as they should have been included in Bill 154:", "“Require that all significant regulatory measures, including rule-making by delegated authorities, undergo a mandatory integrated impact assessment before they are implemented. This process should take place with oversight from an independent, expert body.", "“Legislate a five-year automatic review process with clear evaluation techniques and criteria to systematically review new and existing laws and regulations.”", "What’s clear, Speaker, is that red tape has continued to be an impediment to the growth of businesses and, by extension, the economy of Ontario. Meanwhile, the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party has a track record of reducing red tape in Ontario. A Red Tape Commission was created by the Progressive Conservatives under Premier Mike Harris. Its primary purpose was to reduce red tape for small businesses and individuals, and to promote greater business planning through the public sector.", "I’d like to quote the former member from Lincoln and the co-chair of the commission, Frank Sheehan. Mr. Sheehan had this to say on December 11, 1997, in this place:", "“Prior to the election in 1995, our government identified red tape as probably one of the most significant impediments to investment and job creation outside of the $100-billion debt we’re currently taking care of....", "“The Red Tape Review Commission was struck by the Premier ... and gave us a one-year mandate. In that one-year mandate, we consulted with externals like the ministries, the cabinet and a range of stakeholders from around the community, whether they be business or institutions.”", "I should note, Speaker, that in December 2003, only months after being sworn in, the newly elected Liberal government dismantled the Red Tape Commission. Ontario businesses have reaped the benefits of that action for the last 14 years.", "Earlier this year, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business held their annual Red Tape Awareness Week. During that week, they released their red tape report cards for each province as well as the federal government, grading them on three important categories: political leadership, comprehensive public measures, and a clear cap on government rules.", "Ontario was ranked sixth in Canada, behind British Columbia, Quebec, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and the federal government. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business said that the province was lacking on two of the metrics used in their evaluations.", "On comprehensive public measures, they said, “The province used the regulatory requirements approach several years ago as a comprehensive measure, but has not kept it up to date. The province is not currently tracking any measures of the overall regulatory burden.”", "Speaker, with regard to a clear cap on government rules, “the province is not tracking the cost of additional rules coming into the system so it is impossible to say whether the total cost of complying with rules in Ontario has gone up or down.”", "Finally, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business included next steps for Ontario, should the current Liberal government wish to take the issue of red tape seriously and improve their report card. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business recommended that the government should consider using its approach to calculating red tape savings to determine the overall cost of its rules and put in place a hard cap on the cost of the rules in the system. “In the meantime, it should be careful not to add additional burdensome rules through initiatives like the Changing Workplaces Review” that would undermine its progress on burden reduction in other areas.", "Ontario currently has 380,000 rules and regulations. The administrative burden that this places on businesses is massive, so burden reduction is desperately needed. Many of the proposed measures in this bill are long overdue, and this raises the question of why this bill is coming forward now, in 2017. Why is the Liberal government suddenly interested in reducing red tape on Ontario businesses when the reduction of red tape has repeatedly been an issue for Ontario businesses for 14 years?", "Well, I would suggest that this is related, of course, to the upcoming election. Under this government, individuals and businesses alike continue to work harder, pay more and get less. Life is truly harder under the Liberals. However, this government has spent years developing and implementing an oppressive and chaotic regulatory environment which has discouraged investment, curbed innovation and siphoned billions of dollars out of the Ontario economy.", "The proposed measures in this bill are too little, too late. Ontario needs much more decisive action on the fundamentals that allow an economy to grow and create a competitive business environment. There’s no enforcement mechanism in this bill, and the efficacy of the measures relies entirely on the assumption that the ministers and their ministries will take the initiative to reduce the administrative burden they are responsible for.", "This simply is not concrete enough. Ontario businesses are struggling with skyrocketing energy costs, sudden and reckless increases to the minimum wage, and the impacts of the flawed cap-and-trade scheme.", "In closing, businesses across the province deserve much more than a housekeeping bill that proposes mostly administrative measures without any significant benefit to private individuals or businesses here in the province of Ontario." ],

Absolutely, we have to review them. There’s a lot of them, because the bill is pretty thick.", "The member from Whitby–Oshawa made some good points on the bill, but definitely when it gets to committee, I think that’s where we’re going to hear a lot of the details through these regulations, because when you read some of them over, it’s an overview and it tells you to go back to a subsection of this act. So it’s certainly going to be challenging to go through each of the proposals in here and make sure that when we’re cutting red tape, we’re not offsetting another issue that’s going to cause more red tape. It’s important that we do that.", "When I’m going to have my time to debate, Speaker, I’m going to talk about the importance of small businesses in communities and allowing them to thrive and run—to be successful. When you have a lot of red tape, you spend most of your time going through all the rules to get to the end goal, which doesn’t make sense. Businesses want to be in the business of doing what they’re supposed to be doing and not looking through a maze of red tape to get to what they want.", "It should be something that we can accomplish together, I think, as a Legislature so that we have a friendlier process for businesses, but in the meantime, Speaker, when it goes to committee, that’s when the real work is going to be done. We’ll be making sure that when those regulations are changed or removed, it’s not an offset to something else, ballooning into further red tape." ],

We’re going to continue bringing this bill forward on an annual basis so that we continue to look, to find ways how to cut the red tape, most especially for those small businesses that the member from London–Fanshawe spoke of.", "As I said in the House yesterday, it’s the small businesses that are really the backbone of our economy, and it’s often the small businesses that get entangled in so much red tape, and how important it is for us as a government to make sure that they’re going to continue to do business here in Ontario, that they’re going to continue to thrive in the province of Ontario and create the jobs here in Ontario—so ensuring that, through this piece of legislation, we’re able to address those small businesses.", "The member from Whitby–Oshawa spoke about Ontario and perhaps its lack of being competitive.

One of the things that we continually hear, and in my six years I’ve continually heard from businesses, is about the continuing barrage of red tape from this government, asking them to do more and more reporting, more and more administration and bureaucracy—and less time that they actually get to spend with their customers, who obviously are who they are there to serve. So it’s interesting.", "The member from Davenport just said this is an annual bill they bring back. I’d like to see them put a hard target: How many actual regulations are you truly going to cut, and will you report on how many you cut last year, according to your target? Probably, I trust, you didn’t even set a target, because what I find with a lot of this government is that there’s lots of talk, lots of good headlines, but when you actually get down to accountability and asking for the results, we don’t see that.", "The member from Davenport just spoke about all the wonderful growth. I think she should actually come out to some of our communities and hear how people are truly struggling with the excessive hydro costs that they’re burdened by. Now they’re going to have more and more red tape, which they’re being buried under, and now we’re talking about, again, the minimum wage going up.", "I just received a note today from the Meaford Chamber of Commerce. They had a round table, and they’re very, very concerned, not, again, about the actual amount of the minimum wage that needs to be there—everyone, I think, on this side would suggest that that is a reality—but the growth. They are suggesting that to have a 32% increase in an 18- or 15-month period is just not bearable by many small businesses, and particularly those that have not been forewarned that it’s coming. They want to slow that down. They are suggesting that it should be over five years.", "I think if you were to take some of the red tape away, you are actually going to work to permanently cut hydro rates, because let’s not forget that this fair relief is going be two years—coincidentally, there’s an election in there—and then they’re going to drastically rise again.", "At the end of the day, I want to see hard targets. I want to see them truly say, “We’ll cut this many red tape regulations out.” Then we might actually believe, trustworthy-wise, that they’re going to do it." ],

Do they serve the purpose they actually were created to do?” Often, you get kind of a blank answer, because you’re out to solve an individual problem and you don’t look at what the overall problem is.", "It’s like the new federal income tax changes.

I would offer up this thought about the title. First of all, is there necessary red tape? “Red tape” is a derogatory term; I think we can all agree on that. It’s a nuanced name, and I would suggest that the reason the government even uses this name—let’s take the “unnecessary” out of it—is because they’ve been reading the polls and the polls suggest that we are going to be looking at, if things don’t change, a Progressive Conservative government in 2018. The government, of course, is concerned about that because the government would like to stay the government. So you’ve got a very Conservative-sounding bill coming from a Liberal government.", "I want to just riff a little bit on the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane—I want to go down that track. There is an incredible amount of importance to having regulations, particularly regulations around business. We can all remember the Nestlé fiasco. We can think of a number of multinationals and large companies that routinely take our environment for granted, routinely use our resources without paying enough for them.", "The member from Whitby–Oshawa spoke about the CFIB. With all due respect to them, if you really want to hear the voice of small business, not big business, go to your BIAs, or go down Main Street and actually talk to people in your community. What you will find is, the concerns of the people in those small shops and in those small businesses are not—yes, of course, everybody is concerned about taxation. But my small business folk, for example, back when we were fighting for a $10 minimum wage—which, by the way, gave a 28% raise to a million Ontarians, and the sky did not fall when that happened. It wasn’t small business that resisted that change, because they knew they had to pay more than the minimum wage to attract people since they didn’t have the benefit packages that large business has to offer. The minimum wage is a big business problem. Regulation is a big business problem, for the most part.", "But yes, there is absolutely a necessity to look over how we do things, how we enforce—and enforcement is key here, because a lot of the regulation we already have in place is not enforced well. Witness the Ministry of Labour, where only one in 100 companies ever gets a visit from the Ministry of Labour. How can you possibly enforce labour laws if that’s the case?", "I want to focus on one particular aspect which I see as red tape and that’s in the performance of this government. In question period today, I raised a dramatic instance of human rights being overlooked and not being upheld, and that is of a non-binary person, Joshua Armstrong, who has now had to file a human rights complaint against the government for not providing the ability for them to get a birth certificate. This is surely a human right. We all have the human right, we hope, to have necessary identification—but not Joshua. Joshua can’t get a birth certificate. How is Joshua supposed to get a passport without a birth certificate? How is Joshua supposed to exist without necessary identification? It took five tablings of Toby’s Law, it took a period of five to six years to get gender identity and gender expression, trans rights, into the Ontario Human Rights Code. Does it really take six years to get a form amended? I don’t understand that. I’ve spoken to the minister, and I still don’t get it. Six years to get a form amended to comply with our laws—with our laws. Talk about red tape.", "“Human rights” actually means something. It has ramifications. It means you should be able to get equal health care, equal identification, equal employment, equal housing. So when we add to the Ontario Human Rights Code, that means every ministry, just about, will be affected and will have to look at the way they do business. That clearly did not happen. It has led us to this juncture where, sometime soon, maybe, Joshua might find a birth certificate in the mail. Unacceptable, Mr. Speaker—absolutely unacceptable.", "So there’s an example of inefficiency—and, actually, an abridgement of human rights—and red tape, if you will, because whatever the process is to get the birth certificate, that’s a lot of bureaucracy and that’s a lot of meetings to produce one amendment to a form. Really? So I suggest that the government should look at the way they do business if that’s the case there.", "Again, I listened with great interest to the Attorney General talking about various aspects of this bill. Yes, absolutely, there are aspects of this bill that I’m sure are necessary. But let’s clean our own house, put our own house in order before we look outside. I’ve given you an example of how to do just that.", "Then, to get back again—because I hear, always from the right, both literally and figuratively, from the Conservative Party, about the needs of small business. The reality is, small business has been suffering in this country and south of the border since the 1970s. Increasingly, big business is swallowing up small business. You’ll hear on Main Street that one of their major problems is not government; it’s Bay Street. It’s the big multinationals that they have to compete with. It’s the Walmarts that take away the business from the small hardware store on the corner. That’s the problem for small business. The question is, is this bill going to help that? I don’t think so. So I don’t think it’s really about the needs of small business, which has been on the decline and up against it since the 1970s. We’ve had more amalgamations of business and more and more encroachment on Main Street by the mall since the 1970s.", "Again, all politicians say it over and over again—if anybody watches the John Oliver show, I’m a big fan of the John Oliver show. They did an excellent segment on this very issue, talking about how we all talk about how we love small business, but, in fact, the reality of our world is that small business is hurting and dying, and big business is growing and taking over, and also putting the very jurisdictions of our governments at risk. Because when you’ve got multinationals who can pick up and go, you’ve got a real problem with how you regulate them. So regulation is not the problem; the problem is ditching any regulation by picking up and going to another community or another country, where perhaps they don’t have the labour laws we do and perhaps they don’t have the minimum wage we do. That’s a problem.", "I don’t see regulation as a bad thing. It’s the job of government. If government didn’t bring in laws and regulations, we wouldn’t have a job. I don’t see taxes as a bad thing either, because if we didn’t pay taxes, we wouldn’t have hospitals, roads and schools. So those aren’t the problem here, and they’re not what’s going to help our small businesses. To effect red tape changes—yes, it might streamline their days, make a little bit of work at the end of the day, but their real problem is how to keep and retain their customers in a world where business is being consolidated at a rapid rate.", "I know somebody is going to be talking about IT—you know, start-ups, which we’re great at and we’re doing better at in the city of Toronto, and we’re pleased about that. But mark my words: Those small start-ups—payday will come when they’re gobbled up by the big guys from Silicon Valley, if we don’t watch it.", "So we have a lot of work to do, absolutely, to protect small business, which creates 85% of our new jobs, but this isn’t going to do it. The Conservatives’ stance and their approach is not going to do it. What’s going to do it is doing the real work of government, which is standing up for the little guy—standing up for the little guy against the big guy. That should be the role of the reform movement in government, and we desperately need reform.", "I’m going to leave it at that. I look forward to the comments." ],

It showed in her debate, where she talked about a regulation that’s preventing someone from accessing a birth certificate, which is a basic human right. We all need this documentation in order to get further documents that allow us to have other privileges. I commend her for bringing that up today in question period and also talking about how, in a sense, that part of regulations shouldn’t be a blockage, a barrier to someone getting their birth certificate.", "She mentioned how regulations are a good thing, and we all agree: We need regulations in order for our society to function in a way that’s healthy. Rules are good. Guidelines are good. Expectations are good. Standards that we put in place are very good so that we know where we’re at when we run a business; we know the rules to the game, so to speak.", "But there are regulations where we want to make sure it’s working that way. That’s our job. We need to make regulations that actually work. Looking at cutting some of those regulations that don’t work, that clog up the system, is important as well.", "Again, I commend the member for talking about various things, because when she talks to this bill, she’s also talking about labour laws. She’s talking about human rights. She puts a lot of content around this bill. It was very interesting, and I’m going to miss her when she leaves this Legislature." ],

In many ways, I was pleased that the Premier gave me some additional responsibilities for small business, because when you look at the agricultural sector in the province of Ontario today, we have 50,000 family farms which are the foundation of agriculture and food in the province of Ontario. I might add that it is the largest economic driver in Ontario today: $37 billion-plus to Ontario’s GDP, employing over 800,000 Ontarians each and every day.", "Look, we have many great examples of small businesses that are thriving in the broader agricultural umbrella. I’m a big fan of ice cream; I know my member across the aisle there particularly likes Chapman’s. It’s headquartered in Markdale, Ontario. In my part of Ontario, we happen to like Kawartha Dairy. In Kawartha Dairy’s case, it started out, founded by the Crowe family, in 1937, and over the subsequent years it has grown in our part of Ontario to be a major producer of ice cream. Not only do they have their stand-alone stores in my part of Ontario, but increasingly their product is being found in all the major grocery stores across Ontario, which is quite true of my friend across the aisle—Chapman’s ice cream from Markdale is finding its way through all the major supermarket outlets across the province of Ontario. That is just a great example of how small businesses have been growing in Ontario and will continue to grow.", "Just recently, I had the opportunity to be in Mitchell, Ontario, to make an announcement on Sofina Foods, who are taking a previous pork-processing facility in Mitchell, Ontario and reconfiguring it to make it a turkey-processing facility in that community.

I’d like to remind people that the quota in the province of Ontario is worth $12 billion. We’ve seen enormous expansion in this sector, because they have confidence in businesspeople that their sectors continue to thrive and grow. So I just wanted to take the opportunity to reiterate that, not only on this side of the House, but so that it be said to all the 107 members who continue to support supply management.", "There are a number of areas in this bill that we believe will certainly make it easier to do business for small business in the province of Ontario—Madam Speaker, it’s good to see you back in the chair—and I’d like to highlight just five things here.", "For every dollar of new administrative costs imposed on businesses due to new regulation, the government will be required to offset this cost by $1.25 by removing unnecessary costs elsewhere. This will ensure that government continues to reduce the cost of doing business on an ongoing basis.", "When enacting new regulations, the government will look to harmonize with other jurisdictions where possible, so that business won’t have to juggle different standards. This is very important, especially with our neighbours to the south.", "Madam Speaker, if I could just talk about this for a moment: During June, I had the opportunity to visit seven states, essentially to talk about NAFTA and agriculture. We’ve taken the opportunity to brief the member from Haldimand–Norfolk and the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane on our trip to the States. One of the things that came out of that, and we’re hoping they’re looking at it during the current NAFTA negotiations, is to bring about regulatory harmony between the two countries. Particularly when it comes to agriculture, when you’re dealing with perishable goods, the last thing you want is tractor-trailers sitting on the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor and Detroit because there’s some hang-up due to the regulatory approvals to move that in an expeditious manner. So this is one of the things that we want to look at.", "I’m pleased to be here today and talk about small business with my good friend the member from Ajax, Mr. Dickson, because we all know in this House that Dickson Printing is one of the great small businesses in Durham. You look back many years ago when Joe and Donna Dickson set out, and they probably mortgaged the house and probably put the car up as collateral, because they had confidence that they wanted to start a small business. So Joe and Donna were working together, rolling up their sleeves, because in those days Joe and Donna would have been the president, the chief executive officer, the HR person and the marketing person, doing all the jobs.", "Over that period of time, they were able to grow and grow and grow—and I know Joe appreciates that I’m giving this free commercial for Dickson Printing today. But they’ve been able to prosper and hire more people when it comes to that business, and that’s just a good example of over 400,000 small businesses across the province of Ontario that employ under 100 people.", "This is an important piece of legislation.

It’s just one of those things—again, when we talk about these, I have to bring up that people have lost confidence when we talk numbers with this Liberal government. We were told a long time ago, when I first got here, that there was only $40 million spent on a gas plant, but it turned out to be $1.25 billion. So when I hear numbers like that, I want to see and—I appreciate that the member from Davenport actually went and got some stats and gave me some numbers—I want to also know, how many have they added in that time? What’s the net gain or the net loss? You can say you’ve cut, but if you’ve added three times as many, we really haven’t gotten too far. So, again, I don’t necessarily trust those numbers when I talk about it.", "I’m very proud to be able to represent and to be the critic for long-term care. One of the things that sector is telling me is, this Liberal government keeps adding more regulatory burden. No one is challenging that there doesn’t have to be safety regulation and things to ensure the safety of all of our residents in long-term care, but what’s the value of more paperwork? Is there something that’s actually going to help the patient care at the end of the day that we want to make—even within our own House, we have the regulations and private bills committee that I’m proud to sit on. We often have the legislative Clerks come out and find the government in non-compliance with their own legislation, Madam Speaker, and when we bring it up, because they have a majority, they just say, “Oh, no, the minister says it’s all good. We’ll just leave it alone,” and we never do address it, and it comes back again and we talk about it six months later. Why can’t we just address this and get it fixed rather than having people wasting time and energy talking about the same bill and the same duplication over and over?", "So I hope the government will take this to heart and truly cut unnecessary regulation at every opportunity." ],

Well, it wasn’t due to the Canadian system; it was due to oversupply. You never hear stories like that here, and that’s partly because of supply management—mostly because one of the rules in supply management is, farmers pool their returns and they pool their costs and they pool their losses. And it has happened—if a dairy processor goes down for whatever reason, it’s not the local farmers around that certain processor who lose their livelihood. Due to supply management, all those costs are pooled. Not only do farmers pool their benefits; they also pool their losses. It’s an incredibly unique system, and it’s one of the reasons why all parties—I’m sure all parties in this House, and certainly most politicians across the country support this system because it’s years ahead of its time.

The term “red tape” refers to unnecessary or excessive regulation. To quote the Collins English Dictionary, “You refer to official rules and procedures as red tape when they seem unnecessary and cause delay.”", "That being said, I completely support anything that reduces red tape. One of my first roles here at Queen’s Park, when I was elected in 2001, was as a member of the Red Tape Commission. At that time, my wife and I were still operating a lodge on Lake Muskoka, so I was only too familiar with the challenges that small businesses faced in cutting through red tape.", "I recall, sitting on the Red Tape Commission, that they’d look at any particular legislation that was before the Legislature and evaluate it through an economic test, but you could also bring in things from your constituency. I remember bringing in, one day, 30 letters of rejection from a constituent for the Northern Health Travel Grant. This was a person who had cancer and who had to travel for 30 days for treatment, and the bureaucracy had sent out 30 separate letters, one for each separate trip, to reject them—as an example of something that was just a ridiculous way of doing it. Hopefully, they’ve changed that procedure now.", "In 2008-09, I served as opposition critic for small business. In this role, I heard from small business people across the province. One of the most mind-boggling stories I heard at that time was that of a resort owner who was contacted by the Ministry of the Environment and asked to provide copies of the certificates of approval for each of his small waste water systems. So the ministry was asking for copies of certificates it had issued because, apparently, the ministry couldn’t find them. How is it reasonable that, when the ministry loses certificates it issued, it somehow becomes the responsibility of the business owner to provide them?", "I would say, Madam Speaker, that over time, government has become less helpful to business and more liability-averse. I recall my own experience, in 30 years of running a resort, back in the 1980s, applying to that ministry, the Ministry of the Environment, for septic system approval. I’d go down to Gravenhurst, where the office—which no longer exists—was. They were actually helpful and provided assistance in the application process. For the last septic system that I applied for just as I was being elected, it had changed very much, and the government was not helpful at all. You basically had to hire someone even to do the application.", "There was another story from a convenience store owner who was threatened with a $10,000 fine if he couldn’t produce receipts for cigars he had purchased over the previous four years. At no point since he had purchased the business had anyone from the government come around to offer him any advice on how to comply with all the government regulations—only to inspect his business and catch him when he made a mistake.", "I note that the Ontario Chamber of Commerce is looking for one-window service for small business, because most small businesses are not trying to break the rules, but it’s virtually impossible, if you’re a business of three or four people, to know what all the rules are. I think government has an obligation, first of all, to make rules that are easy to follow and, secondly, to provide some assistance to businesses that are just trying to follow the rules and trying to make a buck. Usually the rules they’re trying to follow have nothing to do with helping them actually succeed in their business. So I think government needs to become much more helpful.", "Unfortunately, that is an example of what government is becoming under this government. Rather than being a partner to help businesses succeed within the rules, government has taken on more of a role of policing—just sending in inspectors to catch mistakes. Certainly that was, again, in my own experience, the case that I saw over the years.", "Back in the mid-1970s was the first time I ever saw a fire inspector show up. Over the next 20 years to 25 years the same inspector came around all the time. Glen Medland was his name; unfortunately he passed on. At that time we were primarily a seasonal resort. He would come in and give me a little warning about what new rules were coming along and would advise me that, “You’re going to have to put in five-eighths fire code gypsum, alarm systems and various things.” He would also time his inspections so that it was near the end of the season, knowing that there was some leeway in how fast he had to do it, so we could do it over the winter when the business was closed. When he finished working, it got to the point where he basically said, “If I find anything wrong I just have to write a violation. I can’t provide any assistance; I can’t do anything to assist you. All I can do is find something wrong and write the violation.”", "That isn’t a good system. It was better the way it was before, where government actually provided some assistance. And I do believe that, in the rules we write, we make them so prescriptive versus setting an objective you’re trying to achieve and letting business figure out how to get there and do it, versus saying absolutely every fine detail about what a business must do to comply with some regulation.", "As a result of the change in mentality, with government being just like the police and sending in inspectors, business becomes nervous about calling government to ask questions. They’re afraid to ask questions in an honest attempt to work within the rules because they’re afraid that it will just bring on some inspection—I can see my speech is much too long for the time frame I have here.", "In 2008, I introduced Bill 121, the Red Tape Reduction Policy Act. I introduced this bill because I was hearing from small business owners in my riding and across Ontario that they were drowning in red tape and excessive inspections. If my private member’s bill had passed, it would have created a test which draft legislation would have been required to satisfy. That test would have required that any minister introducing legislation:", "—identify the regulatory burden that the bill would impose;", "—identify the costs of the regulatory burden;", "—do a cost-benefit analysis of the regulatory burden;", "—consult the people who would bear the regulatory burden;", "—assess the impact of the regulatory burden on the competitiveness of Ontario business;", "—identify any overlap between the new legislation and any other legislation or regulations from this or any other level of government; and, finally,", "—write the regulations in plain language to be easily understood.", "If this government really wanted to cut red tape, they would have passed my bill or adopted it or similar legislation of their own. But what happened? Bill 121 was debated in November 2008, passed second reading and sat on the order paper until the Legislature was prorogued in March 2010. It sat on the docket for the Standing Committee on General Government until it died when Premier McGuinty prorogued the Legislature. I would prefer to be debating my bill, but at least we’re debating a bill about red tape.", "It is good that this bill allows for more than one vice-chair of the Normal Farm Practices Protection Board, in order to reduce wait times for hearings. It is good that this bill allows for the electronic application for pesticides licences; one would hope that we could apply for any licence electronically by now.", "The ministry estimates that this bill, if passed, will save the private sector between $6.3 million and $8.9 million. That is good, but it’s only a drop in the bucket. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business estimates that the cost of regulation in Ontario grew from $12.79 billion in 2005 to $14.758 billion in 2014. That’s an increase of 15%, or almost $2 billion. Obviously the changes that are going to be brought about by this bill are relatively minor.", "Add those additional regulatory costs to the increased cost of electricity; the cost of the Ontario health premium; Bill 148, the labour bill that’s bringing about a 32% increase in the minimum wage and other labour changes, and it’s no wonder that businesses, especially small businesses, are having difficulty.", "Madam Speaker, I can see I’m out of time, so I’ll end there and try to get the rest in in the two minutes that I get at the end." ],

But I’m a bit of a word nerd, and as we were having this debate, I thought, “Where does this term come from?” And it’s instructive, because I’m here, the defender of regulations and, hey, some red tape.", "Apparently Henry VIII, when he wanted his annulment from Catherine of Aragon, actually bound the petitions with red string when he was arguing back and forth with the Pope of the day. Depending on how you feel about the right to divorce and annulment, it may be a good thing.", "But apparently, where the term really comes from is a 16th-century Spanish king, Charles V, who bound the most important dossiers and important documents with red tape. The ones that weren’t so important, the ones that were really fly-by-night and that he didn’t care that much about, didn’t have the red tape. So it actually has changed over the centuries from being a positive thing to being a negative thing.", "Anyway, I’m just defending government’s function as a regulatory body. That’s what we do. Yes, sometimes we ice the cake a little bit much; sometimes it’s not essential. And of course, it’s better to do things online in the computer age than not. But there is a function here that’s so important, and I think we denigrate our function as government when we mock what our function is, and that is to be a regulatory and taxing body." ],

Yes, I acknowledge that he has had a number of private member’s bills and opportunities focused on exactly that: a red tape review and reducing the burdens from government.", "I remember floating around theses halls 20 years ago when Frank Klees was running the Red Tape Commission—Frank Klees, with his beautiful checked jackets. He was focused, and that was part of the direction: It was to get rid of all the red tape that they thought was standing in the way of businesses making money. But I think there’s an acknowledgement, and we heard it from the member from Parkdale, about the history and that there are positive reasons that you want to have regulations and red tape in government.", "What we have been doing on red tape in our government is sort of exemplified in the work of the Treasury Board and its program renewal, review and transformation process, where it’s reviewing all programs and looking for duplication and looking for opportunity for streamlining and efficiencies, which is resulting in tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars of savings. It’s one of the processes, Speaker, that’s allowed us get to a balanced budget from the nearly $13.5-billion deficit when I was elected in 2014. And that’s just the government side of the savings we’re getting.", "In the Red Tape Review Commission, we’ve been very successful with our sector programs in reducing red tape for businesses out there. In fact, I think we’ve been so successful that I’m really encouraged that, should I have the opportunity again in my life to go back into the private sector and start up some of my businesses, I might not be burdened with so much red tape that is unnecessary, and I can go on and continue to make a healthy living in that kind of work.", "We passed our first annual burden reduction bill, made 150 amendments to 50 statutes in 11 ministries, saving businesses up to $31.5 million dollars in that one initiative alone. This gives us another opportunity to look at it, and we’re looking forward to getting it passed." ],

He gave an example of that septic system permitting process, and that government, really, many times now, has moved—it’s always more and more questions and asks about, “How do we keep you from getting into business and moving forward in business?” than actually helping you find ways to be successful and thrive.", "He introduced the Red Tape Reduction Policy Act, Bill 121, in 2008, and referenced that it got prorogued by the government and never did see the light of day. But what he asked for in there was some cost-benefit analysis. What’s going to be the impact when you put new regulation in, and what’s the burden going to be on business? What’s that ripple effect on the people who get the services from there?", "In his discussion, he referenced some of the challenges of business. The health tax: Many people have forgotten about it. It was supposed to come in for one time only, and it’s still there and it’s still being charged. He talked about the exorbitant electricity rates—300% to 400% increases. Again, the government tries to suggest, “We’re going to give you 25% of your own money back and all is going to be rosy.” The reality is that they’re going to borrow $25 billion to do that. It’s going to cost upwards of $43 billion and, in the worst-case scenario, $93 billion. They can reduce a little bit of red tape, but they’ve really burdened us.", "One of the members over there talked about an initiative that was going to cost $9 billion. Their Green Energy Act is going to cost $133 billion, and the hydro relief $93 billion, as I just said. The Beaches–East York member just talked about a balanced budget. I believe both the Auditor General and the fiscal accountability officer have said that those are short-term realities that are going to go the other way, and we’re going to be back in debt and deficit again if this government keeps spending the way they do.", "I’m pleased to see they’re looking, at least. At least they understand some of their challenges now. I struggle with how we can trust any of the numbers they put out. He just suggested a $31-million savings. I’m going to reference it again: They told us the gas plants would cost the taxpayers of Ontario $40 million. It was $1.2 billion. That’s red tape and boondoggles." ],

The Ministry of Northern Development and Mines is changing the Mining Act. Okay, fine. But now they’re in the changeover, and just as we’re going through the changeover, we happen to be going through a mini mining boom in my area, because our area has a lot of silver and cobalt. Cobalt never used to be in demand, but now, because of electric cars, it’s in demand. There’s a staking boom going on in a lot of parts of the north, including Timiskaming–Cochrane.", "You stake a plot and then you go to the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines to register that plot. Then you have the right to do the investigation of that plot to try to get a major mining company interested. Usually, that takes about a month, but now it’s taking four or five months. That’s a huge opportunity cost when it’s your job to investigate and stake claims.", "These people want to work with the government, but they’re being forced out of business because the government is not reacting." ],

Of course, he represents an area with some famous silver veins. I believe you find cobalt around silver veins.", "I was going to use timeliness of permitting in mining as an example of something that could be improved on. I toured Detour Gold in the Cochrane area, and in the hour-and-a-half ride out to the mine, we had a discussion about, “What’s your biggest issue?” The biggest issue was the timeliness of permitting for a mine in the province of Ontario. There is duplication between the federal rules and the provincial rules.", "Another northern issue is certainly the application of the Endangered Species Act duplicating the Crown Forest Sustainability Act in the north. It’s a huge issue in the north right now. I was recently up there meeting with a mill manager, and he was talking about the fact that he’d been a hunter—he’d hunted his whole life. He’d never seen a caribou, and yet they’re doing caribou recovery plans for caribou that don’t exist that could affect the livelihood of the whole mill, a mill that employs 70% indigenous people. The livelihood of all those people is at risk because of the way the Endangered Species Act is being enforced.", "I could give many other examples, but I see I’m out of time.

Ironically, I think it has been beneficial for many of us in the Legislature to have had the opportunity for further technical briefings on this massive bill. It is extensive, to say the least. It truly is a massive bill.", "The bill proposes amendments to over 100 different acts and aims to reduce the regulatory burden on both businesses and on the government, and proposes the creation of a new act titled Reducing Regulatory Costs for Business Act, which covers everything from changing electronic signatures to amending disclosure agreements between a franchisor and a franchisee, to proposed changes to the Pesticides Act.", "The purpose of the bill is to modernize Ontario and get rid of the excessive bureaucracy that bogs us down and has a detrimental effect on how we conduct business, with the aim of saving money for both the government and businesses. That’s really the objective.", "With over 400,000 regulations in place in this province, it makes sense that legislation is being introduced to cut those numbers back and make life easier for everyone, but we have to be certain that, as we are stripping away these regulations, it’s not creating pitfalls and having a negative impact elsewhere.", "We need to examine this bill, which is quite robust, piece by piece to see what works and what doesn’t, and we need to put people and small businesses first. If the goal of this bill is to increase transparency, the government owes it to small business owners and young people entering the workforce, who may not have the legal resources or background, to make sense of its nuts and bolts.", "In my community of London, a large part of our community is made up of small family-owned businesses. Cutting red tape to benefit smaller businesses sounds like the right thing to do, but government needs to make it abundantly clear not only to those of us in the Legislature but to small business owners, families, as well as young entrepreneurs, what those terms are. London is a city that is quickly growing. The population is made up of hard-working, creative, ambitious people who are eager to start new businesses and carry on ones that have been in their family for generations.", "I spoke in the House earlier this week about the London Plan, which is the result of a project titled ReThink London. ReThink London was comprised of over 10,000 Londoners who rallied together over a two-year period to design a 20-year urban plan that envisioned the city sprawling upward and inward to reduce its carbon footprint, creating a strong neighbourhood-centric city with a rich culture and economy.", "I spoke about the London Plan in the context of the government’s alleged plans to revamp the OMB. Funnily enough, the work of over 10,000 Londoners who have a bright vision of the future that would significantly contribute to Ontario’s culture and economy has been bogged down in red tape and is now sitting in administrative limbo.", "For young families who want to stay in their hometown of London instead of moving to a larger urban centre for employment, the Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act is a step in the right direction if properly realized, but we’ve seen this government make tantalizing promises in the past, only to falter on its delivery when it really matters.", "But overall, this bill looks like a positive piece of legislation that could benefit families and small businesses across the province, but aspects of the bill are vague and somewhat troubling. Schedule 4 stipulates that when a new regulation is made that creates or adds another layer of administration cost to businesses, in this case a prescribed offset must be made within a prescribed period of time after the regulation is made or approved.", "Again, the government needs to be crystal clear to small business owners on what the implications of these regulatory costs are, in plain and simple terms. We need to know, when one regulation is enacted under this bill, what the potential fallout is, or whether or not this is beneficial.", "Many aspects of the bill are not only vague but contradictory. Schedule 4 also cites regulations that impose requirements on businesses, where appropriate, and less onerous compliance requirements on small business, yet there is no explicit definition of “small business,” which is a major problem.", "London and its neighbouring townships are surrounded by and situated in rich farmland, so one of the pieces under schedule 5 pertains to London in a relevant way. A proposed amendment to the Pesticides Act removes the six-month work limit on non-licensed or non-exempt assistants to structural exterminators, but also removes the seven-day work limit on assistants to licensed land and water exterminators.", "Again, the government needs to be explicit about the implications of these terms and what it potentially means for people who are working with dangerous chemicals. Is it safe to remove the limits of how much exposure these people are getting to pesticides and other dangerous chemicals? More importantly, what is the benefit of removing these work limits, and who does it benefit? Those are some of the questions we have to ask, Speaker, when we’re talking about these regulations.", "Once you start to read the fine print of this bill, there are glaring problems and issues that raise concern, and many of the finer points require serious clarification.", "Schedule 9 is another problematic part of the bill, which seeks to amend the Arthur Wishart Act. Under the current act, a franchisor must provide a franchisee with a disclosure document at least 14 days before signing a franchise agreement or any other agreement relating to the franchise. That’s reasonable.", "The amendments to the act create new exceptions to this disclosure requirement whereby the franchisor is no longer required to provide disclosure documents if the agreement they have with a prospective franchisee contains certain terms that require any information provided to the prospective franchisee to be kept confidential; prohibit the use of any information provided to the prospective franchisee; or designate a site, location or territory for the prospective franchisee.", "The terms of schedule 9, where disclosure in the franchisee-franchisor relationship is concerned, are cause for concern, to say the least, and speak to a broader problem of transparency, oversight and accountability. Really, Speaker, that is a problem this government has to acknowledge.", "Professionals entering into a working agreement should feel encouraged and uncompromised, particularly young entrepreneurs.", "While there are problems with this bill, cutting back on red tape and the 400,000 or so regulations in place is a change, I think, in the direction of a better place. Small businesses should be thriving, and Ontario should become a more attractive destination to conduct business.", "I hope it is not only the intention of this government to make life easier for wealthy corporations with unlimited resources, but that it is also to make life easier for families struggling to make ends meet, and to allow smaller businesses and new businesses to flourish. That’s where we have to really pay attention, I think, because larger corporations have vast access to all kinds of resources because they have the money to do that.", "In my community of London, we have a vibrant and growing seniors population. I’m the seniors critic, Speaker, and I know this. Some of these seniors, as was mentioned by my colleague in the Legislature yesterday, may not have access to high-speed Internet, so many of these proposals of electronically streaming services may not be helpful to that population. We have to keep that in mind, Speaker. It’s very important.", "Young people, who are eager to get into the workforce and start their careers, deserve to be in a climate that will help them grow and thrive as young professionals. Scaling back the red tape, as is generally laid out in this bill, will make it easier to start a small business or carry on existing family businesses.", "We need to ensure that small businesses are reaping the full benefit of this bill and that young entrepreneurs are entering into healthy work agreements and are in healthy, closely regulated environments. Again, regulations are a good thing. We need to make sure, especially for the workforce, that we have those regulations in the Employment Standards Act, to protect people.", "Again, while many aspects of this bill are troubling and require further investigation and clarity, it appears that this bill could potentially benefit the province’s economy and ease the regulatory burden on both government and small businesses.", "Speaker, I move adjournment of the debate." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s my pleasure to continue debate on this important piece of legislation. What I discussed earlier was how important this bill was in terms of protecting public participation. It’s, again, a hallmark of our society that people need to be able to participate in discourse, particularly on matters that impact their communities, so it should go without saying that people should be encouraged, not discouraged, from participating in issues that affect where they live and how they live. This law will address that.", "When we speak about public participation, we also need to talk about other forms of public participation, and those areas that need to be addressed as well. One of the most important ways that people can participate in public discourse is through protest. Protest, or dissent, is often referred to as the hallmark of a democracy, a hallmark of a free society. You need to be able to get up and say, “I disagree with what’s going on.” While we, in this legislation, are looking to protect public discourse, so that people don’t get sued in a strategic way that is seeking to silence them, so that people who raise their concerns are not going to suffer from a long, drawn-out legal battle that seeks to discourage them from participating in whatever the discourse was, we also need to look at the other forms of public discourse, namely protests.", "The G20—we referred to this a number of times—was one of the worst examples, one of the worst cases of civil rights violations in the history of Ontario and, in fact, one of the most heinous acts of civil rights violation in the history of Canada. It was something that happened due to a number of factors, including the use of the PWPA, the Public Works Protection Act, which is also a law that is overly broad, overly vague and resulted in some gross violations.", "But there is also another area. There is a certain combative culture that exists right now between the police and the citizenship. That combative relationship needs to be addressed. It’s something that requires a culture shift. When I spoke at an event just a year or so back, there was an association of police boards, and they had made recommendations on how to improve upon what happened at the G20. I was invited to speak, and they asked me, “We want you to be critical. We don’t want you to hold your punches. If there’s something we can improve upon, look at our report and speak freely.” I warned them, “If I’m given free licence to speak freely, I will actually do that.” They encouraged me. They said, “For sure. Speak freely and let us know what you think.”", "One of the sections of the report talked about the improvements they need to do around protests. They referred to protests and they said, “We need to improve our strategies around crowd control.” I got up and I said—I want to share this with you, as well, as members of the Legislature—that right off the bat, when you discuss dealing with protesters as “crowd control,” it creates a combat. It creates a divide between the police and the everyday citizens. It creates a tension. The suggestion is that the police are going to control the crowd.", "Instead, I suggested, what if the remarks were based around looking at facilitating the protesters, facilitating this democratic right in an effective and safe way? That would be a shift in the culture if, instead of looking at this as a problem—“Someone is protesting. This is a problem. We need to solve this problem. We need to control this crowd”—the approach was, “This is a democratic right. We want to encourage people protesting. We want to encourage people’s right to dissent.”", "How can we facilitate this right in a meaningful way? That would absolutely shift the combative and intense relationship between the police and the protesters, and instead shift it to something that was more positive, that would in fact encourage democracy, that would in fact encourage those protesters and allow it to be facilitated in a way that would be effective, again, also keeping in mind the police’s important role of providing safety and security. That’s a shift that we need to see.", "If we really want to encourage public participation, it needs to be seen as something that is seen as a valid and important thing. When it comes to what happened in the G20, a lot of the problems arose, again, from the PWPA, the fact that that law was so broad and gave far too many powers. When you have broad powers that are vague, it results in violations.", "In addition to that, there’s also a problem around the culture. The culture was not one that spoke to facilitating and encouraging the protesters; it spoke to fighting with them, controlling them—this combative discourse. That’s what we need to shift.", "While this law certainly speaks to protecting people from legal ramifications, it doesn’t address the other form of public discourse or public participation, which is protest. We need to talk about that. So I suggest that one particular, concrete action we can take is looking at how we can change policies when it comes to people protesting.", "In terms of the provincial government, the Attorney General’s ministry can inform police forces across this province and say, “When there is a protest, this is something that should be encouraged. It should be something that’s facilitated.” How can we do that? Well, we can make sure that there isn’t an immediate escalation of the protests by having an approach which is militarized or an approach which is aggressive or an approach which is combative. We can begin by saying that we don’t need to approach protesters as a problem; we can step back and be passive in terms of our approach to them.", "These can be policy directives that this government can implement. Again, if we are serious about encouraging public participation, let’s have a policy directive from the government that says that protesting is acceptable, protesting is encouraged, and we want the police to facilitate it. We want the police to have a passive role in terms of protests until there is a clear and identifiable risk, and to only approach those identifiable risks in a manner that’s appropriate and proportional to the risk. Instead of assuming the worst and having an aggressive stance right off the bat, we would like to see, and I would like to see, a policy that encourages those protesters by saying, “We can begin the interactions by having a passive approach, an approach which is not combative.” That would encourage more discourse.", "The reason why I speak to this is, while the laws are important—and laws obviously determine the direction that our province moves in, and laws that protect discourse are, of course, important—we also need to have policy directives. We also need to inform police officers and the police forces across municipalities and across the province in terms of what their direction should be. What should be the appropriate manner in which they deal with citizens?", "In addition to that, it also speaks to some of the recent events that we’ve seen in the past year where there have been some serious concerns around police accountability and the approach that police take to individuals in general. In addition to something that I’ve requested, which is this directive on encouraging public participation through a policy on how protesters are dealt with, we also need to look at the police strategy around de-escalation of conflicts. Right now, as it stands, the police have a policy which, if you look at recent events, seems to be an escalation strategy. If there is a conflict, if there is a problem, the police come in in a manner which is escalating the conflict, which is escalating the situation, particularly in situations that are already tense.", "I refer to the Sammy Yatim tragedy, which is one of the telling situations where the police could have approached that situation in a manner that would have de-escalated the violence. There was a threat. There was certainly a concern. But Mr. Yatim was in a streetcar by himself. There were no other bystanders in that streetcar. The approach taken by the police in that case was not one that looked at de-escalating that situation but instead looked at approaching it in an aggressive manner that escalated the violence. These are areas that we really need to look at.", "Again, if we’re speaking about public participation, we’re speaking about encouraging people and allowing them to participate in democracy. But we also need to look at how the police approach protesters. There needs to be a serious discussion around how the police approach conflict. Instead of looking at strategies which involve the use of force, use of weapons, let’s look at the use of de-escalation tactics—the use of negotiation, the use of communication—to take a situation and bring down the tension levels, bring down the stress levels so that we don’t see some of the tragedies we’ve seen in the past year.", "When we look at this particular legislation, while I’m encouraged by much of the bill—the recommendations from the SLAPP panel were implemented in a meaningful way in this bill—I also want to speak to some of the problems we still see. One of the major problems that still exist is that if we look at the situation—let’s use the example of a community meeting where the community is opposed to a particular development in their neighbourhood. The community members get together and say, “We do not want this development to occur. It will erode the nature or the character of our community, and we don’t want it here. We don’t want that particular development.” They get together and protest this development, whatever it may be.", "As it stands, without this legislation, the developer can say, “Because of this protest, because of these key community activists or community spokespeople who are opposed to our development, we are suffering an economic loss. We are suffering, potentially, because we can’t make this building or this store happen. We can’t allow it, or it can’t be built. Because there is a delay in it being built, it’s going to cause us an economic loss.” So a lawsuit is initiated, and its sole purpose is, essentially, to silence that individual.", "This bill will protect that incidence, that particular scenario, by saying, “Listen, in those cases where a developer seeks to sue somebody strictly to silence them—there is really no merit to their argument—and, in fact, what that community spokesperson or activist is doing is something we want to encourage; they’re participating in public discourse, they’re actually speaking about how they want their community to develop, and that’s a good thing, this law will allow for a quick mechanism to dismiss those types of lawsuits.”", "But what about the letter that’s sent? If you don’t have legal training, what if that community spokesperson isn’t actually sued but they receive a letter, and the letter reads, “You will be taken to court and sued for a substantial sum of money with all the recourse of the law,” and there’s legal terminology used in that letter; there is the threat of a lawsuit in that letter? That letter itself is so chilling—it has such a chilling effect; it’s so scary to read—that the community spokesperson says, “Listen, I don’t want to get sued. I’m going to stop doing what I’m doing. I’m not going to risk a multi-million-dollar lawsuit, because I am just afraid. I have received this letter from a very prestigious law firm or a well-known lawyer, and I’m afraid,” and that person decides not to participate. This bill wouldn’t protect that scenario. That letter is something that could silence that individual, could intimidate that individual, and we don’t have recourse.", "The individual ought to know—if they have legal training, they would know—that simply receiving a letter in the mail isn’t an actual lawsuit and isn’t going to result in anything. But what does an individual who doesn’t have any legal training know about that? The reality is that we need to do more. If we really want to encourage public participation, we need to ensure that people are informed of their rights.", "So, in addition to this legislation, I think that one of the areas we need to work on is policy directives for the police to encourage participation in terms of protests, but we also need an informed public. Not only do we need legislation that protects people from being sued in a strategic way to silence them; we also need some concerted effort from the government to educate and inform the people of Ontario that it is something you are allowed to do, and we in fact encourage you to participate in this way.", "We want people to speak about their communities. We want people to speak up for a particular development or against it. This is something we want to see happen, and it is your right to organize, to get together as a community and speak about these issues. If you receive a letter that says you are going to be sued, this new legislation will protect you from frivolous lawsuits—lawsuits that are without merit. And if you are engaged in meaningful public participation, that is something we want to encourage and protect; don’t be afraid of letters of that sort.", "So I think there needs to be an education component to this discussion, this sentiment or this idea of public participation. We have a law that is before us now, which is important, but we also need to have an education component that speaks to informing the public of their rights, of the importance and of our position as legislators; as decision-makers, we want to encourage people. In addition, we need policy directives that actually speak to those who are actually going to enforce the rule of law. We want them to know, those who are involved in police forces, those who are involved in carrying out and enforcing the law—we want them to be informed and to have policy directives that make it clear that we, as Ontarians and Canadians, believe that people should participate in public discourse and debate and have dissent. This is something that’s important.", "I want to highlight—and I spoke of this very briefly on a previous occasion—the New Democratic support for this bill. Ontario New Democrats have long believed in protecting public participation. In fact, both in 2008 and 2012, Andrea Horwath, the leader of our party, introduced anti-SLAPP legislation. When Ms. Horwath, the leader of our party, introduced this legislation, we did not receive support from the Liberals at the time, and we want to make it clear that we have supported this issue. We acted on that support by introducing legislation, and we’re happy to see now that the Liberal Party has finally caught up with us.", "The importance of this bill, again, can’t be understated. There have been a number of incidents where people have tried to raise their concerns and have been silenced by lawsuits. I spoke about environmental groups that have raised their concerns and have been silenced by developers. I previously spoke about, and I want to raise again, people who are part of municipalities who have raised concerns around various developments.", "In fact, there were a number of people who were concerned about the treatment of animals at a particular facility, at an amusement park, and while the government has now introduced a law seeming to address this issue, I want to make it clear that people have raised concerns around animal treatment and did not receive any support or protection and, in fact, were hit with significant lawsuits. For example, Mr. Powell of Marineland Animal Defense is right now currently facing a $1.5-million SLAPP. It was based on his activities raising concerns and information around the treatment of animals. Right now, he is facing this lawsuit.", "This is a real issue. People are faced with these lawsuits which discourage them, which intimidate them, which make them unlikely to participate now and in the future as well. We need to make sure that people know that this law is going to be enacted, and when it is enacted, we need to make sure the public is aware of their rights, that they’re aware that there may still be lawsuits initiated against them but there is this protection that exists. I think that is so important. Often we have a law, but if that law, first of all, doesn’t get enforced, it does nothing. In addition, if we don’t know about the strengths of that law, if we don’t know there is a law that protects our actions, it doesn’t have the same weight.", "While this law is supported by all parties, and I’m looking forward to its passage, I want to make sure that we do some work around informing the public of their rights so they know they have this protection. I look forward to a society where we encourage more public participation." ],

If I could share quickly with all of you, I was a community activist back in 1985. I had a confrontation with the Ministry of Finance on property assessment. The assessor and myself did not agree. And guess what? The government served me one of these letters, saying that I should cease and desist. Had I gone away, market value assessment would not be in place today. I ignored the letter, I pushed ahead and, sure enough, we had market value assessment in 1998. The law was changed. This Legislature agreed with me.", "I have to say to you that this particular issue has been outstanding for a long time. It’s long overdue. I want to congratulate the government for finally recognizing that we need to stop this because it happens in many areas in community concerns, where someone takes an action because they have a concern in their community and they receive these types of letters from lawyers for developers and all kinds of other issues in communities.", "So it’s long overdue.

He was about to speak, and then he looked around furtively. Then he explained to us on the committee that he was subject to a $1-million lawsuit. He felt maybe he was somewhat protected to be able to stand up at committee and talk about the confrontations—you mentioned confrontations—that they were having, as a ratepayer cottagers’ group, with developers.

You know what? I’m sure a lot of us have had those. I can remember when I first got involved with community groups, with farm organizations, and I can remember my first ugly lawyer letter. Basically, unless I complied with this letter, the sky was going to fall in. When you’re 22 or 23, you’re just starting out with your business and starting out with your family—maybe I was 25; I can’t remember. You got this letter, and it’s sitting on your kitchen table. You think, “Okay. Do I continue with this battle or do I throw in the towel right now?” How many good fights, worthwhile causes, have been lost because of—and I’m sure there’s a nicer word for it, but I call it the ugly lawyer letter?", "He brought up a very good point. This legislation—and we support it. It is kind of a touchy subject in parts in my riding. In parts of resource industry places it’s a touchy subject, and I’ll get to that in my 20 minutes. But we’ve supported this legislation from the start, continue to support it, but it doesn’t have any impact on the legal professions—you know, the $1,000 lawyer letter: you pay $1,000, they send you an ugly letter, and hopefully you go away.", "We do need a training session on how to equip people to deal with that, because most of the time, when people get involved in these controversies, they come to it innocently enough, and they have to learn the hard way." ],

We just want to reassure the members that we were debating this before May of last year. An election was called at the beginning of May, we went to the polls, and as a result, there was a new mandate—when the election took place on June 12. What happened was, as we all know, any existing legislation that was being debated had to be reintroduced and debated again in this House.", "I’m hearing a lot of the same comments that were made in the previous debate before May of last year. I think all three parties support this bill and want it to move on. I’m hopeful that that will happen. I think the government wants this to move forward. The government has been consulting, since the very beginning, with certain groups—the panel—to make sure that the legislation is drafted properly. We’ve all seen the legislation; it makes a lot of sense. I think it’s important to get this to committee and, hopefully, back here for third reading after some changes are made, and eventually into law.", "I listened carefully to the member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton when he last spoke on the 5th of March—it was debated that morning. I was rereading some of his comments, and I think they’re right in line, pretty well, with what all three parties are saying: We have to fix the system. We have to make sure that people who want to protest against a certain kind of law—if they want to participate in public participation, when someone wants to build something or a developer wants to put something up, they want to be able to speak out, and they don’t want to be stopped by a lawyer’s letter, or a lawyer writing something and saying, “Dear Mr. Protester: You’re going to be sued.”" ],

  "text" : [ "I think one of the things that’s important to address when we talk about this bill is that many of these lawsuits that are launched against individuals that are speaking out often get dismissed in the end. But when’s the end? It’s years and years of legal battle; years and years of battle; the case drags out; there is significant cost; there’s significant intimidation; there’s significant pressure on the individual; and when a judge finally says, “You know what? This case really has no merit. I’m going to dismiss this lawsuit that’s been hanging over this individual’s head,” it’s years later.", "The effect of the lawsuit is that, during that time period, the individual didn’t speak out on it, was silenced, was discouraged from participating because they had this lawsuit hovering over them. What this lawsuit does is—not the fact that people can’t be sued frivolously; people will be sued, potentially. What this law will do is that if there’s a frivolous lawsuit, if there’s a lawsuit strictly designed to silence somebody, there’s a mechanism to have that dismissed in a quick fashion. That’s really what this bill does, and that’s a good thing. That’s an important thing.", "We have to recognize that, as I’ve said, many cases have actually been dismissed by judges. They’ve found that there is really no merit to the lawsuit, but it’s taken years. The importance of this bill is that it allows for a quick identification of a case that’s frivolous—that’s a SLAPP—and will allow for that type of lawsuit to be quickly dismissed so that the individual facing that lawsuit can move on and continue to do what they want to do, which is participate in their community.", "I want to thank all the members for sharing their experiences—some members who have also faced these types of lawsuits themselves. It’s important to hear their stories because this is a real issue. I’m really encouraged that we have this legislation that will ensure that, at least at some level, we can encourage public participation." ],

I’ve had the opportunity to speak to its predecessor—Bill 83, I believe—which died on the order paper. But my excitement really stems from the fact that this is an issue that I have had the great opportunity to work on for many years now on behalf of my community of Ottawa Centre.", "The member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton was right when he suggested that the member from Hamilton Centre did propose a bill, Bill 138, in 2008, but, once it died on the order paper, never re-introduced it. It was a bill which was similar in gist to what we are talking about but had some different elements to it.", "I worked along with my community and I have had the opportunity to speak in this House because of certain circumstances some members of my community went through to ensure that we do have robust anti-SLAPP legislation in the province of Ontario. Where I picked up on the work was based on the work of the advisory panel that the Ministry of the Attorney General had created back in 2010. That advisory panel was made up of some really notable people like Professor Mayo Moran, who is the dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Toronto, along with Brian Rogers of Brian MacLeod Rogers Law Office and Peter Downard of Fasken Martineau. That panel recommended one overarching recommendation, being that Ontario should have anti-SLAPP legislation, but then also provided some very specific recommendations as to what should be in that bill.", "In a nutshell, what they said was that anti-SLAPP legislation in the province of Ontario should have a test for courts to quickly recognize a strategic lawsuit, that it should contain appropriate remedies for strategic lawsuits, that it should have appropriate limits to the protection of legislation against strategic lawsuits, and that there should be methods to prevent abuse of any future legislation against strategic lawsuits.", "What I did back in 2012 at the behest of my constituents in Ottawa Centre was to take that very thorough work that the advisory panel had done and work hard with the legislative counsel in drafting a piece of legislation that captured the advisory panel’s recommendations. I was privileged to table a bill on October 15, 2012, Bill 132, as a sum of that work. The bill was called the Protection of Public Participation Act.", "In that journey, I had the great opportunity of working with community associations like the Hintonburg Community Association in my riding and people like Albert Galpin, somebody who was SLAPPed and had a strategic lawsuit brought to him because he stood on an issue of public interest. I worked with the federation of community associations and Don Stewart, who is a representative and lives in my riding. He was very instrumental in giving me guidance.", "I also had a great opportunity of working with many NGOs, groups like Greenpeace and Environmental Defence and other environmental NGOs who were very instrumental in giving me advice. I do want to give a shout-out to a good friend of mine who is a very good environmental lawyer, Will Amos, part of the Ecojustice legal clinic at the University of Ottawa, who has been a great source of inspiration to me on this particular bill. We were able to table in Bill 132 a real sense of the advisory panel’s recommendations because of the work all these people did.", "Coming back to my original point, the excitement for me is that when I look at Bill 83, which died on the order paper and which was the first government bill on this very important issue, and now Bill 52, what I see as almost a replication of what I had presented in Bill 132.", "I think it’s a very exciting thing to see, when you see government adopting, in essence, all the elements of what you presented in your private member’s bill in a government bill. So I want to thank the Attorney General for her confidence in the work that myself, legislative counsel, my staff—I want to give a shout-out to Geoff Turner, who worked very hard on this issue—and all the community and non-governmental stakeholders that I worked with did, to be able to see their work reflected back.", "In my very limited time, I just want to highlight some key things that are important in this bill and that are important to my community. The proposed legislation would implement most of the panel’s recommendations, as stated earlier. The key elements of the proposal involve implementing a fast-track review process for potentially strategic litigation under the Courts of Justice Act. This new process would allow the courts to quickly identify and deal with lawsuits that unduly restrict free expression in the public interest, minimizing costs and other hardships endured by the defendant. It will extend qualified privilege in defamation law under the Libel and Slander Act. Currently, statements made by a person with a direct interest in a public interest matter to another person who also has a direct interest are privileged, so they do not give rise to liability for defamation. What the Ministry of the Attorney General is proposing is to extend this privilege to cases where these communications were reported in the media or otherwise, for example, discussed in a blog.", "The legislation, if passed, will also make procedural amendments to the Statutory Powers Procedure Act to avoid lengthy and expensive legal cost applications before administrative tribunals. That’s a very important point, because we forget that a lot of the matters in our system today are dealt with by quasi-judicial tribunals. They’ve been created because they’re expert tribunals. They bring a certain level of expertise, and proceedings at those tribunals can be used as a matter of strategic lawsuits against public participation. The Ontario Municipal Board comes to mind because of development issues that many, many communities face. So this particular change is extremely important.", "Speaker, what this bill really does, and I think all members, as I’m hearing the debate, are speaking to that, is protecting public participation and freedom of expression, which is core to the constitutional rights that have been given to us in this country, and protecting reputation and economic interests. That’s the balance of what this legislation tries to do. We need to make sure that we are able, as members of the public and as members of respective communities, to be able to express our views that are important to the public interest and that are important to our communities, but also be able to then protect reputation and economic interests. That balance is very much captured.", "That’s why one of the key essences around this legislation—and I say this specifically in case people who are listening or paying attention to this issue wonder, “Why do we need legislation like this? Isn’t our system already designed in a way that will protect frivolous lawsuits?” When communities and individuals in our communities speak on issues of public interest, that’s a different matter. We need to make sure that there are safeguards in place. We should not have a system in place where lawsuits can be brought against those individuals because somebody, the economic interest or whatever interest, maybe does not like what somebody else is talking about in terms of a particular public interest within the community and uses legal tools—“legal” means the legal system—to shut them down.", "What this bill does, if passed—it does not stop somebody from bringing a legal case; it actually creates a fast-track method, an expedited process by which a judge could review whether this is a strategic lawsuit against public participation—when somebody is talking on an issue of public interest, they should be free in an open and democratic society—or if it has merit when it comes to some sort of libel or tort being committed.", "In the case of one of my constituents who was SLAPPed, and was in the end successful, his success came around two years down the road and it cost him about $50,000 in legal fees. That’s a huge burden on a member of the community who was just talking about an issue that was important to the community and the safety of the community. If something like Bill 52 had existed in law, that matter could have been resolved within 60 days, as outlined in this legislation, and of course you can imagine that the legal costs would have been that much more limited.", "Speaker, I will stop here but to say that I’m very excited to see this bill, and I urge all members to support this. I think this will result in stronger communities and it will result in the protection of our rights and the rights of our communities in terms of expressing the public interest." ],

Most recently, in January, I held an event called the community service awards, where, for people in the community who had been doing good work on behalf of the community, we recognized them with a certificate in appreciation. We recognized them in front of their communities not because they asked for it, not because they wanted it, but because people in the community every day across our province, and Etobicoke Centre is no exception, do wonderful work.", "When I think about this bill and how it applies to my community, I think about those folks and I think about how hard they work, how much time they invest—most of it is volunteer time—and the amount of impact that they have on our communities and how fundamental it is that they be able to speak up, that they be able to advocate effectively.", "That’s what this bill is about, from my perspective. It really goes to that issue. It goes to the issue of protecting people who are doing great work on behalf of our community; in my case, the community of Etobicoke Centre.", "There are many great things about our province, but one of the great things is that we live in a democratic country, and we believe it is important that people can speak out on matters that are important to us. By protecting citizens against frivolous litigation, this bill will allow us to stand up for the values that we hold dear. It will allow us to stand up for those democratic principles that we hold dear.", "Using intimidation tactics to silence someone is a misuse of our court system. It’s unethical, in my view, but it’s also a misuse of our court system. If we pass this legislation, this would allow the courts to quickly identify and deal with strategic lawsuits and minimize not only the emotional strain but also the financial strain on defendants, as well as the waste of court resources.", "I think about recent work that members of the community in Etobicoke Centre have done—and they didn’t face lawsuits, to my knowledge. I think about the wonderful work that they have done. I think about the residents’ associations. One that comes to mind is the Humber Valley Village Residents’ Association, which recently worked very, very hard over the course of years and raised a tremendous amount of resources to advocate against a development in our community. I think about the amount of time and resources they put into that.", "We need to protect people like that who are speaking out, who are doing their best to do what’s good on behalf of our community. Again, this is what this bill is designed to do, and I’m very optimistic that that’s exactly what it will do.", "This bill was formed after the work of an advisory panel, a very highly qualified advisory panel. I think that’s an important thing to consider: that our government was very careful in crafting this legislation. On May 28, 2010, we announced the establishment of an advisory panel to provide advice on legislation against strategic lawsuits. The panel was chaired by professor Mayo Moran, who was dean of the faculty of law at the University of Toronto, along with the Brian MacLeod Rogers law office and Peter Downard of Fasken Martineau.", "On December 21, 2010, the advisory panel reported. The panel recommended a number of things: that Ontario should adopt legislation against strategic lawsuits, that the legislation should include a purpose clause for the benefit of judicial interpretation so that it’s clear how the court should interpret the law, and a couple of other things that are also important.", "This is something that our government is putting in place, but this is something that has also been implemented in other jurisdictions. Approximately half of US states have statutes against strategic lawsuits, and on June 3, 2009, Quebec passed its own legislation as well.", "When I think about this piece of legislation, I think it is one of those things that allow people in their community to do great work on behalf of their community. It allows them to do that without the fear of emotional strain and financial strain, and it ensures that resources applied to our court system are applied to the area where they are most needed.", "We are all here in this Legislature. We all speak up in this Legislature every day on a range of issues because we believe they will strengthen our communities and our province, and improve the quality of life for the people of our province. When I think about my community of Etobicoke Centre, I think about all the people who are doing fantastic work on behalf of our community, and I want to make sure we protect them that they can speak out, that they can advocate and build a better community for all of us.", "That’s why I think this bill is important, and I encourage all members in this Legislature to support it." ],

Of course, just before I spoke, the member from Etobicoke Centre added his voice, again talking, I think, in a very articulate way about the importance of making sure that residents of his community of Etobicoke Centre can have the opportunity to participate in public debate, to add their voices to discussion in a balanced way, and to make sure they don’t feel that sense of fear about the legal system being used to effectively shut down their participation in that process.", "There has been a great deal of work that has gone into the creation of this legislation over a number of years.

We all will know the bake sales that community associations host, just so they can do things that make their communities better.", "Through this legislation, Bill 52, we want to make sure that somebody else who has a bigger interest, a powerful interest, is not able to use their might and silence these community groups, these hard-working volunteers in our neighbourhoods, from improving things, the quality of life. That is why I was so motivated to work with my constituents in drafting a very significant piece of legislation—a very significant piece of public policy—and with the help of many members from all three sides, to convince the government that this is worth being a government initiative. I’m really excited to see that it is, and I urge all members to support Bill 52." ],

A SLAPP is a lawsuit that is pursued for the sole purpose of soliciting and punishing those with an opposing viewpoint. The effect is also sometimes referred to as litigation chill.", "Speaker, there are other pieces of legislation that people are getting a little bit upset with, too, and litigation chill is what it actually is, and that’s with joint and several liability. This government refuses—200-and-some municipalities asked them to help them change joint and several liability. Last year at AMO, I was there when this minister—the Attorney General who we thought was going to work with these 200-and-some municipalities—said, “No, we’re not doing anything. We’re not doing anything.” So, now communities, including my own, are faced with what they call litigation chill.", "This year, we saw some municipalities shutting down toboggan runs for kids—shutting them down. In my own municipality, they have taken out diving boards and different things because they’re afraid of being sued, which is similar to what this legislation tries to address: a fear of being sued with these huge lawsuits.", "Part of what defines a SLAPP is the fact that it is a meritless case that is intended more to intimidate or punish the defendant rather than seek justice for a wrong suffered by the plaintiff. Speaker, that gets right back to my previous points here about joint and several liability. It’s a threat. It is a threat, and it’s causing premiums to skyrocket for municipalities. The insurance companies have to try to justify their rates. How do you justify these things? How can you justify these things when you don’t know just where it’s going to go?", "Insurance companies—municipalities asked for some help here, and this government ignored them. We believe the reason they were ignored is because the only ones they listened to, in the FOI documents that we were able to get on this subject, were four or five lawyers’ groups. That’s all they listened to. Of course a lawyers’ group is going to say, “Don’t touch this,” because in effect you’re fooling around with their income. So it’s interesting that they bring this legislation back to the House, because it did die before, when they won’t listen to things like I have just been talking about.", "Speaker, I am certainly not a lawyer, and there are things that I do want to question about this bill. In the SLAPP legislation as it is right now, what I wonder about and what I think about is a case that happened in my riding a number of years ago. There was no lawsuit over it, but people were afraid to say anything, so maybe it pertains to this.", "Back in the 1960s and 1970s, at the landfill site in the township that I still live in, Boy Scouts decided to plant trees around it. The trees were made to kind of beautify the landfill site, and they did. They planted native species. What it did was hide the garbage that was put in there. The other thing it did is that it stopped garbage from being blown out of the dump. We called it a dump back then; I guess you’d call it a landfill now. You could look at this bush, or forest, I guess, if you want to call it that—native species; there’s ash planted and different types of evergreen trees—and you could see in there how it would catch these bags, especially plastic bags, which we all know are something that is being addressed; there are some plastic bags that will decompose over a certain period of time. But you could see them in the trees. Most of the bush was planted on the south side of the landfill site and around to the west and north, because our prevailing winds pretty much come in that direction.", "When I was a councillor in the municipality of North Perth, where this landfill is, the landfill had to be redesigned. So we did a study, and they brought back what this landfill needed to do in order to come up to standards as prescribed by the government. One of the things that had to be done was that all these trees were ripped out. They ripped them all out.", "The Scout leader who at the time had led this tree planting saw that this was happening. These trees by this time were about this big around, probably 30 feet high, something like that. He saw what was happening and said, “What are we going to do about this?” He said, “These guys”—Scouts at that time; they’ll be in their 30s and 40s now—“are pretty upset because they worked quite hard at putting this in. It was a project of Boy Scouts at that time, and now it’s going.”", "They were afraid to say anything. I don’t know whether it was because of this, having a SLAPP lawsuit put on them, but I just wonder if that is something that could have been done, whether the contractor who was doing the work in the landfill—if the Scouts had come along and protested, whether they could have had a lawsuit slapped on them. They chose not to say anything. They didn’t want to get involved with courts and they let it go.", "When they got done clearing that bush, those trees, out—perhaps they were maybe planted in the wrong place; I don’t know the whole story to it—there were logging trucks coming in there, day after day after day, taking these trees. They bulldozed the stumps out, they piled them up in a huge pile in the landfill and they brought in a big grinder and they ground them all down, as they did all the brush.", "If you talked to this Scout leader, he was pretty upset. It was a pretty sad story on his part, anyway. But again, hopefully this type of legislation that is being proposed by the Attorney General will change some of this, where someone can get up and say, “Whoa. Let’s stop this for a minute and let’s talk about it,” and the judges will certainly have discretion to say whether it’s frivolous or not.", "Speaker, another thing I want to talk about—I didn’t know much about this until the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane spoke about it the last time we debated this bill—was his involvement with SLAPP lawsuits. That’s terrifying, simply terrifying, what they did. As I recall, it was with a municipal land site, and as I recall, because people in the country are good folks—as there are good folks in the city, and all over Ontario—they got together and helped them out, both financially and with encouragement, so that he was able to stay with this thing, or his group was able to stay with this thing and fight it.", "Because that’s the issue. If somebody came to me and said, “I’m going to sue you for a couple of million dollars,” even if I won the lawsuit at the end, what am I going to pay my lawyer with? It’s very expensive. It’s really expensive, and that’s what keeps people saying, “Oh, we give up.” This type of thing, the way it is now, allows that to be happening and allows that money to be spent, because you’ve got to keep fooling around with it.", "As I understand the legislation, the judge will have some latitude. He can say, “Look, this is frivolous. We’re not going to do this,” and that’s the end of the story. I like that part of it. I think, too, that we have to be careful; maybe, if it gets to committee, we can look at the parts of it that companies do have issues with. I’ve heard stories in the forestry industry that there are some issues with this legislation, because groups can move in to stop a forestry project, and this was one way they had to stop doing that—although it maybe needs to be changed a little bit to suit both sides of the equation.", "The other part of what I wanted to speak about today, if I could find my notes—there we go. Speaker, I had quite a weekend. Paddyfest was in Listowel—it’s been going on for two weeks—and also a Lions convention in Stratford that went on all weekend. I was at both for quite a bit of the time. There was an event—I will link it up to this business here. I went to the Presbyterian church on Saturday, flipped pancakes for three hours and fed the multitude. The Presbyterian church, in case you’re ever interested, only charges five bucks for pancakes and sausage with maple syrup and the whole deal. It’s very inexpensive. A lot of people could come in and enjoy this.", "Anyway, when I got thinking about this joint and several liability—the Presbyterian church has done very well with modernizing their kitchen and whatever else to try to come up to standards, but then they have a bunch of volunteers in there who probably haven’t studied the book as to procedures and whatever else.", "Now, I’ve been doing this for a lot of years; I’ve never been sick. None of the people who have come in have ever been sick. But yet, we have rules and regulations that say, “Well, you could get sick,” and ta-da, da-da, da-da. And it costs people a lot of money." ],

I know that for a fact. If you saw the parade, you saw that everybody dressed up in green ties and hats. But I suppose if somebody was protesting something that happened in Ireland back a number of years ago, they could probably surround that church and stop the thing. So what would the church have to do? Call a lawyer and do a SLAPP? I don’t know. Is that the recourse? I don’t know.", "I think we need to be careful how this legislation is drawn up and certainly safeguard some of the people that could be involved in these lawsuits.", "I’ve been involved with service work for a long time. I joined the Lions Club in 1987. We had a number of events that we had been carrying on for years that we had to stop because of legal business. It didn’t hurt anybody. It made us some money. But when we got to insurance costs and we got to legal business, we decided to give them up because we didn’t want to get involved in things, maybe in a lawsuit here and there. I think that’s probably where our lawsuit business has gone. It’s gotten so big and so huge that the ordinary person and the ordinary group just backs off and says nothing about it. That’s really too bad.", "We used to have—I don’t know—for 40-some years in Moncton we used to have what they called a turkey shoot. It went on for years. People would come out and they’d shoot at targets. They wouldn’t shoot at turkeys, but the prize was a turkey. That’s the way it worked. The Moncton Lions had this on for years, and it was a very successful event. Then the rules about guns started changing. You’d get the odd person—you’d hear a whisper or two: “If somebody gets hurt here,” all this stuff. So we quit; we quit this thing.", "The other thing that we used to do is we had a tractor pull. We had it for three or four years and built it up to a pretty big event. We quit that one too because of liability reasons. We were afraid of these lawsuits, and you couldn’t buy insurance big enough to cover these things. In fact, some insurance companies wouldn’t cover them, period. That’s all there was to it. So we quit these things. That’s what this SLAPP legislation and legislation like it has done to, certainly, small communities. I can imagine what it could do to communities all around Ontario.", "We stand by the rights of individuals to express their opinions, especially on matters of public interest. The reality is that while SLAPPs, as they are known, are relatively rare, when they do appear or occur, as we’ve heard, they can ruin people’s lives. We do not think it is appropriate for residents to fear having a voice in the growth of their communities.", "Moreover, these SLAPPs are, by definition, unfounded and stand little chance of succeeding—that’s the interesting part, Speaker; they have little chance of succeeding—so they needlessly bog down Ontario’s court system. Bill 52 does try to address this, so that’s a good part of the bill.", "In my time left, I will give a bit of a wrap-up to this.", "The bill establishes a formal legal process for assessing suits to determine if they are SLAPPs, and disposing of them if so. That’s a part of the bill that I think really has to be in there and should be worded very strongly so that our justice system can address it if it happens. In essence, Bill 52 establishes a framework that allows an individual to determine if a lawsuit brought against them is a SLAPP or not within a 60-day time frame—again, another good part of this bill.", "Thank you, Speaker, for allowing me to speak.

We’re very committed to the principle that people need to be able to participate in this democracy; that’s without doubt. I think it’s quite ironic that the government that has brought forward this bill currently has lawsuits against people for participation, participating in public discourse. That is quite ironic and that’s something that was brought up in today’s debate. I think it’s somewhat troubling if a bill that’s proposed is seeking to protect public participation and the very same government is actually discouraging public participation. It’s quite ironic and I think it’s something we need to look at. But it’s certainly a bill that we support; it’s certainly something that we need to see in terms of protection. It’s something we need to see implemented quickly.", "There’s also one additional piece that I want to highlight. Initially, when this bill was introduced, there was a retroactive clause so that people currently facing lawsuits could make use of this new protection. I’m curious whether or not the government could answer this question: Is this retroactive clause no longer a part of the legislation? I understand that now there isn’t the retroactive clause, so that the existing lawsuits that people are faced with wouldn’t actually have the protection of this piece of legislation. That’s very concerning. There are people right now faced with serious lawsuits, and if they are not being protected by this legislation, this government is not really doing a good job in protecting public participation. So we really need to look at that. If that’s not here, why was that removed and why aren’t we protecting those people who are facing lawsuits?" ],

They say, “In its present form, Bill 52 is a direct attack on the job creators in this province and the 170,000 Ontario citizens who work directly and indirectly for Ontario’s renewable natural forest products sector.” They’ve gone through the whole bill and have made some criticisms and some suggestions for improvement, so I really hope the government looks in detail at their suggestions. They have four areas of concern: the public interest concept and how vague that definition is; they talk about proper onus; they talk about the costs sanctions and due process.", "They are raising concerns because of what they have seen of organizations like Greenpeace targeting Ontario-based companies that are working in the forestry sector under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act in a very sustainable way, but attacking Ontario products.", "They note, “We recently witnessed how a well-financed radical organization embarked on a malicious campaign filled with gross misinformation intended to damage the market for forest products sourced from Canada’s boreal forest.

I spoke against the Adams Mine Lake Act, actually, on behalf of the federation of agriculture, because I wanted to know how you could have what would be the biggest landfill in North America, how you could approve that, and then change your mind and not look at how it got approved in the first place. To me that was a little detail, because this was, at the time, going to be the biggest landfill in North America. Lo and behold, they decided, “Ooh, that’s not as sure a thing as we thought,” but this government never really looked at why it was approved in the first place.", "Getting back to the SLAPP suit, the Adams Mine Lake Act was proclaimed, and because of the Adams Mine Lake Act, the way it was set up, they took away the right of the investors and the owners of Adams mine to use their fully licensed pit. So they all got paid. Do you know by who? By the taxpayers of Ontario. Because the government said, “No. You have a licensed pit, but you’re not allowed to use it.” So they all got paid by the taxpayers.", "But the federation of agriculture and myself—the lawsuit never stopped. The company never dropped the $10-million lawsuit. And what happens when you’re a small business and you have a big lawsuit like that? The bank was really worried because at that time I probably owed half a million dollars, which isn’t a lot on a farm, but I owed half a million dollars. The bank doesn’t want to lend you any money.", "We had insurance. We had anti—I forget what it’s called. It’s insurance when you’re a director of an organization, so if you get sued—do you know who the toughest people are? The insurance company, because they get on your back so bad. The company said all I had to do was recant, go on local TV and say that I was wrong—“No, Adams Mine was going to work”—and they would drop the lawsuit. Well, I wouldn’t, because we weren’t wrong. I spent a lot of time on the phone with lawyers from my insurance company who wanted me to back down. The only way that I got out of that lawsuit is, I decided to run against the sitting MPP." ],

One of my colleagues here spoke about the Green Energy Act. One of the things that bothers me about the Green Energy Act is that when it was created, it superseded most other acts in the province because this government wanted to kick-start green energy. So, basically, solar panels and windmills started popping up in places where you would never be able to build other things. That is happening right now in my riding.", "Timiskaming, the centre part of my riding, is one of the best places for agriculture in northern Ontario. It is equivalent to most places in southern Ontario. Yet there is no classification for the land. So while this government, in their mandate letter to the Minister of Agriculture, said that we have to develop northern Ontario, that that’s the future of agriculture, in Timiskaming right now, they are covering it with solar panels—the best land in northern Ontario. What makes that even more insulting, Speaker, because of our sparse population, and because most people have no access to natural gas in the country, so people watch solar panels sprout up around them, and these same people, many who are on fixed incomes—worked hard, own their own houses—never thought that the price of electricity would go through the roof. So these people watched solar panels being built in front of them, and they don’t know how to pay their hydro bills. That is the ultimate travesty, and it’s happening as we speak here. We have no control, as we speak. Solar panels are going up on the best farmland in northern Ontario. Do you know what? The Premier says that the future of agriculture in Ontario is northern Ontario. Well, you’re covering the best stuff up with solar panels, and that’s because of the Green Energy Act. It must have sounded like a good idea here at the time, but you never thought out whether it was actually going to work beyond these walls, beyond these cities. With any legislation, we have to do a much better job at that, including this legislation.", "At first read, this is a good idea, but we really have to be careful to make sure that we check the flaws. On top of that, Speaker, one thing that this government is extremely guilty of—I’ve only had experience looking at this government, but for a government to make mistakes? That’s not the worst thing. But not being willing to look objectively and correct them? That is close to a crime. When they know the problems that are happening with the Green Energy Act—they know that and yet they forge ahead. They turn the other way.", "I look at my riding. We’ve got big solar projects where the contractors don’t get paid. This happens time and time again. They know this is happening, yet they don’t act. They talk about strategic lawsuits, and they use them themselves. Again, we have to make sure that when we make laws or criticize laws, we actually develop legislation that is going to work in the province, not just in these halls." ],

His personal experience of being slapped with a lawsuit for standing up for his rights and for his community’s rights is the perfect example of why Bill 52, the Protection of Public Participation Act, is such an important piece of legislation. That type of incident that the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane experienced has been experienced by many other residents of Ontario, perhaps in some instances not as significant as that one, but in many smaller ones.", "The government has made some changes to the proposed legislation from what was before the House before, and it has followed the recommendations of an expert panel, with one significant difference: that this bill does not recommend, as the panel did, the automatic ability to get awards of costs at certain administrative tribunals. Lawyers were consulted and felt that that was too inflexible and not a fair application of law. So to the member’s comments about trying to get the legislation right, there’s been a great deal of thought put into this bill to get it right.", "The ultimate test of whether this bill is going to function properly is that we are a nation, a province, of laws. No government can simply make administrative decisions about whether lawsuits are fair or not; that is up to judges, in courts of law. People can have representation in those courts of law, and there are appeal mechanisms against a decision that somebody disagrees with, even under this legislation. So I think that the checks and balances are there, Mr. Speaker.", "I know in my own community there was a resident who fought a developer over a development application because he felt the development was going on crown land. The person opposing the developer proved that the development cannot go ahead because it’s on crown land, on the waterfront, yet they faced tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees from a SLAPP suit. So they won, but they lost. This legislation would prevent that for the residents of Etobicoke–Lakeshore and for the residents throughout Ontario." ],

He raised the issue of potential misuse of a piece of legislation and, in this case, it could be utilized by a well-funded special interest group, and he referenced the forestry sector.

I’d like to echo that that certainly is a piece of legislation that has been very punitive to a lot of municipalities. It was done with a lot of ability to steamroll other legislation and take away democracy from local, municipally elected people. That’s not good legislation. That’s not something that should have happened, and we don’t want to see the repeat of this type of legislation be the same.", "We are generally supportive. We want to see it go forward.

They were going to put liners in, technology and all of that. But any of the opponents of it that came out from the public—they even went as far as to—they asked some of their own in-staff about the landfill, and the people told the truth. They ended up being fired and served with papers by the company, their own employees. They used intimidation on several other private citizens who were environmentally friendly who were against this landfill—you know, harassment, bugging them with lawyers’ letters, comments in the local newspapers and all these things that were going on by this individual company. They even went as far as to indicate to politicians that they wouldn’t get a lot of support in the next election and things like that. In other words, they were being bullies. They wanted to get what they wanted in spite of what impact they had on average people. Of course, they were scaring everyone off because they were afraid to be sued by this particular company.", "This Protection of Participation Act is long overdue. I’m glad to see it on the table.

The way this bill works is that someone like the member can go in front of a judge and apply and put an argument forward that the $10-million lawsuit is frivolous and has no merit, and the judge can decide early in the process whether to continue that lawsuit or throw it out.

The panel came back with a number of recommendations. One of them is for this government to adopt legislation against strategic lawsuits. The other piece is, the panel also asked for the legislation to include a purpose clause for the benefit of judicial interpretation.

I, for one, am very proud to live in the best province in this country that encourages and supports the ability to speak out on matters that are important to our constituents and matters that are important to each one of us.", "Furthermore, if the legislation is passed, it also allows the courts to quickly identify and deal with strategic lawsuits, because there are emotional issues and financial constraints if you have to take a case before the courts. Again, it also helps the defendant, who in many cases will be challenged if we have to drag out a lawsuit before the courts, and it will waste the courts’ time.

One of them is in my riding, the township of Georgian Bluffs. They passed that resolution on March 4.", "Mr. Speaker, I agree and support Bill 52, in principle. Principally, I agree that the bedrock of our democratic society is that we have healthy and strong public participation in our communities, voicing our concerns—even dissenting ones. That’s what we’re all here to do. Oftentimes, particularly when we as the opposition stand, that’s our job. Our job is to look at legislation, to look at things the government is doing or intending to do and to challenge them on it, to ensure that they’re creating legislation that’s going to be good, effective legislation for all users, all people who are going to be bound to that law, to that legislation. So I think it’s always healthy when we have a good discussion, a good debate, in fact; and dissenting views are always welcome, I believe, as long as you can do it in a respectful, civil manner and take from it that there is really a good rationale to bring that forward. Hopefully, the other party can look at it, and at the end of the day we can then all come back, especially in committee, and look at those amendments, look at changes that are going to strengthen that bill, to make it the best, most effective legislation that we can come up with.", "The bottom line, at the end of the day, is that we need to protect people’s right to speak up on matters that impact them. Really, if we go right back to those brave individuals who died in the wars for us, it’s that freedom of expression, freedom of speech that we all have the liberty to enjoy because of their heroic deeds and actions. It’s something that I think we all have to stand in this House every day and remember, that we have that privilege, we have that right to speak freely.", "Any time someone comes along and threatens that, particularly if it’s a large group with a lot of money that tries to stifle debate, to stifle the ability for people, individuals, organizations, associations, even a small group of people, to have their say, to be able to bring their viewpoint to the table, I think we all have a right to stand up and fight that.", "As I have told my constituents who wrote or called me about this bill, we’ve had a few examples of public participation being under attack in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. It’s been talked about a lot in here today by a number of the speakers, the Green Energy Act. Particularly, the wind turbines are always top of mind in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. I talk about the heavy cost of litigation brought against my constituents by a wind turbine company. They really came in, a lot of these large companies, particularly with foreign ownership, and tried to bully their way through. They’ve tried to steamroll. Sadly, this government wrote legislation that virtually undermined all other legislation, which allows them to do that.", "Our democratically elected representatives at the municipal level really have been silenced because the Green Energy Act just came in and said, “We don’t need to listen to you. We don’t need to ask for your opinion or your approval. We can place these wind turbines here if that’s where we want them to go.” It’s unbelievable, Mr. Speaker. It has put a lot of people under significant stress and burden.", "Was it meant to silence them, to intimidate them? A $300,000 lawsuit can easily silence anyone into submission, particularly those of modest means. They just finally say, “You know what? I don’t have the ability, I don’t have the money, to be able to go against that.” One of my colleagues here, from Timiskaming–Cochrane, I think, said that—a farmer who was working hard, raising a family, running his business. When you start throwing lawsuits at them, that becomes very, very challenging. I credit him and applaud him for standing his ground for his principles and not giving in, despite his own insurance company coming to him and saying, “You need to give up on this. You need to pass and just retract those statements.” So kudos to you, my colleague Mr. Vanthof from Timiskaming–Cochrane, for standing up for what you believe is right. That’s what we all get sent here to do, and I trust that’s why he has been re-elected to represent the people in his riding.", "Some of that has happened across rural communities after residents tried to stop wind corporations from surrounding their homes and communities with giant turbines. They don’t want them, they didn’t want them, they continue to not want them, and yet, at the end of the day, they still have large lawsuits that are intimidating at this point.", "In their statement of claim, the companies alleged that the residents were making misleading statements to discredit their business and have made misleading statements to the public, such as making comments on how residents were feeling terrorized by the wind companies.", "The Green Energy Act was and continues to be a thorn in the side of rural communities and one that has brought on this kind of intimidating litigation that we’re trying to stop here today. You can’t threaten. You can’t bully just because you’re big and you have lots of money. That’s not the way we do things in Ontario. It’s not the way we do things in Canada, Mr. Speaker, and I think all of us in this House want to stand up and ensure that everybody has the equal right to speak.", "Rural Ontario in particular has never really been the same since this government forced the Green Energy Act on our communities. I think it’s only a bit ironic that we’re debating Bill 52 in the context of this Liberal government’s Green Energy Act. They have actually put legislation in place that took away the ability for locals to have a say in anything. Many other businesses wouldn’t be allowed if we used current legislation before the Green Energy Act, and yet they brought in this legislation that supersedes and gives them the power to choose, “We will put wind turbines there,” in someone else’s backyard. A lot of people making those decisions will never have to put up with those wind turbines in their backyards, but they are certainly okay with it being done in someone else’s.", "It’s especially ironic, Mr. Speaker, in the context of the Premier’s own lawsuit slapped on two members of our opposition party. Her $2-million lawsuit against the two members of our caucus is over the concerns they raised and the comments they made on the Premier’s party’s gas plant scandal, which has been under investigation by the Ontario Provincial Police for almost two years.", "Of course, everyone in the House knows, as do members of the public, that we in the official opposition have questioned and continue to question the Premier’s role in the alleged wiping of computer hard drives in the office of former Premier Dalton McGuinty that relate to the cancellation of two gas plants in Oakville and Mississauga. Yet, at the end of the day, this Premier chooses not to bring two people forward to give testimony, the people that actually know the truth about this, and yet ironically she brings out this type of legislation.", "I think my colleague from Leeds–Grenville has very appropriately brought up that saying and doing different things, different meanings—he used a different word that I’m not going to use so that I don’t have to withdraw, Mr. Speaker. But at the end of the day, we need to ensure that when someone says something, there’s one set of rules for all across our land and across our province. I have concerns that in some cases there is a bit of irony going on here, that what’s good for the goose isn’t always good for the gander.", "How ironic and farcical that the same government that wants to protect us from intimidation practices is using a $2-million lawsuit to intimidate and to shut down conversations to try to not allow them to speak—two members of the official opposition, two good colleagues of mine. To me, this $2-million lawsuit is meant to stifle, silence and punish the two opposition MPPs for daring to question and give opposing viewpoints on the Liberal Party’s billion-dollar gas plant scandal. It’s simply unacceptable.", "I believe that when people elected us, they entrusted us with the responsibility to ask tough questions. That’s part of the job of the official opposition: to challenge, to question, to ensure that the government is actually doing things in the best interest of the greater good for all of the people who have duly sent us here. Our pursuit of the truth is how we hold this government to account—any government, truly, to account. With this one, certainly, there are lots of reasons to hold it to account. Every day, sadly, we’re bringing them to account. Now we have four unprecedented investigations. I would be fearful that this government, again, is trying to bring in something to their own benefit that they can use to stifle debate and stifle us asking questions, and yet they’re trying to appear to the public that they want accountability and they want transparency. There are challenges sometimes when we hear one thing and yet we see a totally different action from that side of the House.", "Because those two MPPs in our caucus raised valid criticism and debated an issue of great public interest, perhaps the Premier will want to be a willing host for the first application of Bill 52 when it’s passed into law.", "There are a lot of good things. I think this is a step in the right direction, but I also do want to allude—and I believe my colleague from Parry Sound–Muskoka, when he has his turn to address, will bring this up, and certainly the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane—that we have to ensure that when we write legislation, it’s actually there for the greater good. We have to be cautious not to allow unintended consequences to come forward when certain large companies or vocal groups can actually misuse this type of legislation. I think well-funded special interest groups certainly could take this, if we don’t write it properly—with balance, and making sure that we close any of those gaps and those corners so they can’t utilize it for their own benefit and turn it against a group—because we need to ensure that this legislation will always protect the greater good. We need to make sure that we’re not going to open up a door for people to use it in the exact reverse way that it was intended and be able to shut down things and shut down people being able to speak.", "I think the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane gave an example of a mill in his riding that, as a result of malicious statements made by environmental groups, actually left his area. He lost that mill and that employment, the ability for that community to survive and thrive, because of some malicious statements that you can’t retract. The old laws allowed people to come out and say those types of things with really no retribution to them. I think it is a good first step. It’s moving in the right direction, in principle, I do believe. But I think we need to make sure we look at it from a well-rounded perspective. We need to ensure that there aren’t unintended consequences.", "A SLAPP is a lawsuit that is pursued for the sole purpose of silencing or punishing those with an opposing viewpoint. That’s unacceptable. As I said in my opening remarks, our province, our country, has the privilege because of those forefathers who went ahead of us, those brave souls who fought for us and lost their lives, made the ultimate sacrifice so we can have free speech. Anything that stifles that is simply not acceptable.", "This effect is also sometimes referred to as litigation chill. Part of what defines a SLAPP is the fact that it is a meritless case, and it’s intended more to intimidate or punish the defendant rather than seek justice for a wrong suffered by the plaintiff. Typically, SLAPPs are withdrawn shortly before going to trial; however, by this time, they have served their purposes. They have forced the defendant to go through an extended period of duress, often at great cost financially.", "Again, a lot of these things can happen, Mr. Speaker, where there would be a well-funded third-party special-interest group that knows that they’ve got a small body there, an individual or a small group of people, that doesn’t have the financial resources to fight this. They’re hoping that by bringing this out, they can just shut them down, they can keep them from having their say, and that’s inappropriate. Hopefully, we can utilize this legislation, Bill 52, to address that.", "Bill 52 establishes a new legal procedure that can be used if someone is sued for voicing their opinion or opinions on matters of public interest. If enacted, Bill 52 would allow the defendant in this situation to move a motion that would allow them the chance to prove to a judge that the legal proceeding brought against them arises from a communication they made regarding the public interest. If the judge was satisfied that this is the case, the legal proceeding would be dismissed, as it would, in effect, be determined a SLAPP. However, if the judge was not satisfied, the legal proceeding would proceed.", "The judge would also be able to award compensation regarding costs in the motion if they deemed it appropriate. Again, we hear cases where there are frivolous lawsuits brought against someone, and we have no recourse to ever go after those people making those frivolous cases.", "In my case, certainly I’ve had a lot of experience with quarries. Someone can bring up a frivolous concern against a quarry wanting to expand or open a quarry, with no real ramification to that person bringing it up. Yet they may hold that company, and more importantly, the people that that company may actually employ and give gainful employment to, up for many, many years and at millions of dollars of expense to said quarry owner. Those types of things, Mr. Speaker, I’m also trying to look out for as a legislator, to say, “How can we close those loopholes?” Nothing against someone being able to have their say, but in that case, it’s the opposite of this: They’re actually trying to hold up something with no real, sound, rational ability.", "I’m going to go back to some of the more technical points.", "If the judge dismisses the legal proceeding due to the motion and finds that the suing party brought the proceeding in bad faith, the judge may award the defendant damages as the judge considers appropriate. Again, I think that’s a good strategy. That ensures that people doing it for frivolous reasons won’t come forward. It’s making sure that when there are sound, legitimate things going on, that can’t happen and somebody can’t frivolously or vexatiously hold that proceeding up.", "If the suing party has proceedings before a tribunal, the defendant who has moved a motion under Bill 52 may also supply a copy of the motion that was filed with the court to the tribunal, and the tribunal proceeding shall be stayed until the motion is dealt with in court. Bill 52 also places a 60-day timeline on the hearing of the motion so that the matter may be dealt with in a timely manner. Again, I think what’s happened in the past is, someone files this motion, and it just sits there in perpetuity for the most part—long periods of time that just stretch out the resources of the other party to a point, hoping that they’ll just go away or they’ll say, “I can’t afford it if this stays in court too long,” and they’ll just give up and walk away. Thereby they are silencing that party again. That’s not acceptable, Mr. Speaker.", "This is a key factor in limiting SLAPPs’ negative effect on the court system. It is also important for countering the effect of potentially having tribunal proceedings stayed while the motion is before the courts.", "The bill also amends the Libel and Slander Act to establish that the current privileges regarding oral or written communication possessed by individuals who have a direct interest in a matter of public interest are also extended to media representations or communications of said individuals’ oral or written communication. Basically, right now if someone has a direct interest in a matter of public interest, they can discuss it and be fairly protected from legal action. However, if a reporter or someone else were to write about what that person said and publish it, then they would be susceptible to legal action because they could be seen as not having a direct interest in the matter. Bill 52 extends protections to include individuals/reporters recounting/repeating any discussions on the matter.", "As PC caucus members, we stand behind the right of individuals to express their opinions, especially on matters of public interest. Again, back to most of what I’ve said here today, that’s the whole fundamental tenet that we’re based on: the ability to have free speech, the ability to challenge. Certainly, as a member of the opposition, that’s one of the key roles and responsibilities that we have, to be frank: to ensure that we voice our concerns openly, that we are able to challenge the government on an act that they’re bringing in or an intention that they want to bring in." ],

We can’t accept that, Mr. Speaker. We do not think it is appropriate for residents to fear having a voice in the growth of their communities. You want people to be able to come forward. I again go back to the Green Energy Act, a case where that legislation by the Liberal government that imposed it on communities is so strong and so powerful that people have felt they don’t have a say, that they can’t actually step up. Then the companies that typically are involved with these wind turbine facilities are so strong and so powerful that they, again, intentionally intimidate and try to put a lawsuit in place to fearmonger, to make that person step back and not voice a concern. Then they can pretend that all is well and good in that community. Certainly in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound I applaud those people who, from day one of the Green Energy Act, have stood up and fought hard.

I asked the Premier, who directed it to the Minister of Energy, and I have never gotten an answer why. I’ve got one contract, one site, $20 million: never got paid. Another site, as we speak, $40 million isn’t getting paid. They’ve got FIT contracts. We’re told it’s part of the contract.

Unfortunately, she only filed it with the city clerk, someone able to deal with the city ones and not the regional ones. What happened for doing a service to the community? They took her to court, the people she had forced, I guess, to give the money back. There may have been another penalty, but they did not choose to oppose that penalty.

The bill, for the most part, does reflect some of the recommendations that came forward from the 2010 panel.", "It has taken a long time to get here. There are some flaws that need to be fixed, and certainly we in the NDP are committed to ensuring that hard work actually happens at the committee level.", "Also, I think that it needs to be mentioned that our leader, Andrea Horwath, brought forward similar pieces of legislation in the past, in 2008 and 2012. It’s actually caused me to remember the first time I came to the House to spend the day with our leader. At the time, she was mentoring me. That day, it was the presumptive legislation that was passed, all in one sitting. I’m sure the Speaker will remember that because that piece of legislation got pushed and pushed and pushed, and the government brought it forward, but then the Conservatives sort of moved it, and then they had to pass it.", "At the end of that whole process—I don’t think that’s ever happened. I think that was the sole time that a piece of legislation was passed on the floor of the Legislature, all three motions passed, and it became law—after, of course, it got proclaimed. So that’s how things sometimes happen in this place. It’s a slow process. It doesn’t always have to be slow, I must say, and I feel that way about this piece of legislation.", "The three major issues, though, that I do want to address in a very cursory sort of way are that the bill, as I said, does incorporate some of the recommendations from the panel—a majority of them. However, it doesn’t reverse the onus of proof. I think that this is a major flaw.", "The government has the ability to bring a stronger piece of legislation here for us to debate. I don’t think there’s any question that the party initiating the suit does not have to prove that the suit is not being brought to silence public participation. So this really is the essence of what we’re trying to address. For people to have the courage to speak up, speak out and take action on very controversial issues—some of those issues are environmental, and I think that those are the majority of the ones that we think about. But it’s also important to understand that activities that attract SLAPPs include citizens’ reporting of environmental violations, filing complaints with government agencies, contacting the media, speaking at public meetings, participating at hearings before administrative tribunals or engaging in public campaigns.", "All of us in this House, if you’ve ever sat on a committee, and all of us have, and someone has come forward to raise a concern—for instance, the finance committee travelled all across the province and listened to the lived experience of Ontarians. It’s incredible to me. Some people just shake, they’re so intimidated by this process, and I think that’s our fault, really. We need to make sure that people understand that this is their House and those committees are there for them. We’re there to listen to them and to bring their voices back to the Ontario Legislature.", "At the finance committee in Ottawa, one woman stood out for me. She was literally shaking with fear as she told her personal story about what it was like to live on ODSP, how the only time she sees people is when she is on public transit and why that money was so important to her. I just think that it takes such courage to speak out and stand up and share your personal story. But there is risk; there is risk in doing that. I think that Bill 52 will mitigate some of that risk for some people in the province as they stand up for their communities and for the causes that they genuinely believe in.", "The second flaw is that it does not specify timelines for filing of a responding affidavit by the plaintiff or mention anything about the defendant filling additional affidavits as per the panel recommendations. The timing is always a concern for people who are involved in these issues, and it doesn’t reverse the onus of proof.", "I also want to make mention and pose a question for the House on Bill 52: Why was the retroactive clause removed from Bill 52? If it’s the right thing to do going forward, why can’t you look back and say, retroactively, these cases happened and litigation was pursued, so why can’t we right those wrongs as well? So that question is outstanding for us in this party, and I think that actually it demands some attention. We will push that as it gets to committee.", "Everyone who has actually stood up in this House thus far has a personal story to share, if it’s from the wind turbines—and up until the end point, the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound had my full attention. But on the wind turbines, it’s true that if there was proper public consultation beforehand, and if that consultation process was respectful of those voices in those communities, then you wouldn’t have the tension. You wouldn’t have the litigation, and you wouldn’t have people pursuing and conflict and tension and threatening people’s livelihoods and their homes. It just wouldn’t happen. In general, I feel that was a completely avoidable situation. If the Green Energy Act had been put into place with some forethought and almost some integrity, then we wouldn’t have had that tension. It’s a real shame, actually, because it’s a lost opportunity to move towards a green energy plan for this province which actually would make a huge difference.", "The flaws exist, but they can be fixed; almost everything can be fixed. But there are some things that are outstanding that will affect the way that the strategic lawsuits are actually formed. I’m particularly thinking about the way that Ontario is growing and the way that land planning is actually happening in the province. It’s hard for us, of course, not to think of Line 9, for instance, and the way that communities are affected by different points of legislation across this country.", "In Kitchener–Waterloo, we have such an active community that’s very engaged, very informed. They keep their politicians working all the time, and that’s the way it’s supposed to be. That’s what we signed up for too, by the way. But the way that Line 9 and the group of activists who have mobilized around that pipeline going through very fragile and vulnerable land across the riding and also around the Grand River—a lot of people don’t understand it. I think there are 27 watershed MPPs, so there are MPPs who have conservation areas and major bodies of water—which essentially keep the province alive, because we need water. That hasn’t changed, Mr. Speaker. We need water. It doesn’t matter how much money you have. If you don’t have clean water, it doesn’t really matter.", "So we have a lot of people in our riding who have come to visit me and gone to visit the other MPPs. They have made a very compelling case for caution on Line 9 and for due diligence, quite honestly. Please remember that there has not been a comprehensive environmental assessment of this pipeline.", "The reason I raise this around Bill 52 is that there’s one woman who has spoken up. She has been very vigilant. Her name is Louise Lanteigne. She has been very active on conservation, on species protection, on mitigating the negative impacts of growth on our communities. I’ve known her for a long time. It’s interesting because she has been successful. She was able to “delay the project earlier this year when she raised concerns about emergency shut-off valve placement along the line, arguing there was only one valve near the Grand River.", "“On October 6, the NEB ruled that Enbridge”—who is, of course, the distributor—“did not meet the requirement for safety and said it was not persuaded Enbridge had done enough to protect the environment in the event of a pipeline rupture.”", "Activists can really serve their communities very well. But as I said, there’s risk in doing so. This particular woman—I’m quoting this from the Waterloo Chronicle; James Jackson has written this, and it’s a matter of public record: “Some of the information is related to her intervener status on the Line 9 reversal project”—has really become an issue and a topic of conversation because she actually initiated an access to information request with the National Energy Board, requesting any and all records that mention her by name. Just this last October, she received a computer disc with more than 1,000 pages of information, including inter-office National Energy Board emails, media mentions and even her activity on Twitter.", "You have the National Energy Board monitoring an individual, an activist, more so than they were monitoring the pipeline. That should raise some concerns for all of us, I would think, Mr. Speaker. She has been threatened with legal action against her by developers in the past. The community has rallied, I think, on the whole.", "Fear shouldn’t be the dominant emotion when you decide to take a principled stand on the environment or on a just cause or on an energy issue. Fear should not be the dominant emotion. Ironically, this is what I’m most afraid of: that fear is becoming a tool in our political arena, if you will, and fear in division, actually. So there is a very good reason to move forward with Bill 52, the Protection of Public Participation Act. It has taken some time to get here, but I think it will be welcomed by many in our communities.", "There’s a really interesting thing happening in the province of Ontario right now. Social media has broadened our understanding of issues. I think you have to be careful because you have to be selective of what you read and what you believe, but it has given some new energy to activists, who are just actually normal people who care deeply about something. That’s a good thing, Mr. Speaker, because there’s a lot going on in the province right now.", "It’s hard for me not to reflect on Bill C-51, actually, which is happening at the federal level, Mr. Harper’s bill. In the context of how you protect the rights of citizens within the province and within the country, I think that Bill C-51 is the antithesis to Bill 52. Ironically, they’re 51 and 52. Bill C-51, of course, criminalizes political activism. It gives police wide-ranging powers of arrest. It allows warrantless CSIS spying on Canadian citizens. Most importantly, it vaguely—vaguely—defines terrorism. Even the Canadian Privacy Commissioner said that in his mind, it goes too far. When you have an independent officer of the Canadian Parliament speaking out against a piece of legislation like Bill C-51, then I think that we should be paying attention to that.", "There’s always this delicate balance between the rights of citizens and the power and authority of government. Government in this instance, by bringing in a piece of legislation which can protect those voices, those voices that have the courage to stand up and speak and that will not be silenced into submission around public consultation, for instance—that’s a good piece of legislation that I think we can make stronger.", "In Waterloo, it’s also really interesting—and this is where you’re going to have a convergence of legislation, policy and communities speaking up. I think that this is healthy. I think it’s healthy for our democracy to happen. But look at the good-places-to-grow piece of legislation, for instance, which has identified certain communities across the province and said, “This community must intensify and grow in a certain way”—grow up instead of growing out, which makes sense for all sorts of reasons that I think all of us should fully understand. Then you have the Ontario Municipal Board, for instance. It was interesting that the minister without portfolio raised the OMB in his community of St. Catharines. He also looked at the people who are on those Ontario Municipal Boards. What I’ve learned, as the finance critic and Treasury Board critic for the NDP, is that not only do you have to follow the money at this place, you also have to follow the people. Who has influence? Who’s getting appointed to boards? Who’s making decisions? Who has this past history at a company and then gets appointed to a public board? Because they bring that philosophy with them.", "In Waterloo, this is a case that sets precedent for the entire province of Ontario. The Waterloo region did a very good job of doing a review of how their citizens are going to be looking at housing, for instance. They’re not looking for the suburban sprawl, two-storey, three-bedroom houses anymore, because they’re aging and they’re looking to be down in the core, where we’re building the LRT.", "The Ontario Municipal Board was approached by the developers because they didn’t like the region’s plan. The region, which did its due diligence—as municipally elected politicians, they developed a strategy to only grow to 86 acres. The developers, of course, didn’t like that. They weren’t willing to adapt their business plan, although some of them did. I have to be clear: There are some very progressive developers in Waterloo region who have looked at the core and said, “You know what? We can build very innovative, creative, energy-efficient, very progressive housing options and make a lot of money.” So they adapted their plans.", "But there are still the developers who just want to keep building over all that beautiful farmland on an aquifer that provides water for the entire Grand River area, the Waterloo-Wellington area. The aquifer there is so important. There’s just too much to risk.", "So you have a region, a municipality, conforming to a piece of provincial legislation, Places to Grow, and then you have developers going to the Ontario Municipal Board saying, “We don’t like the Places to Grow plan and the region of Waterloo’s plan,” and the OMB overruled the regional government and so completely undermined democracy in a holistic way.", "Ironically, the government, of course, didn’t like that that happened as well. So there, you’ve appealed. You have a government appealing a decision made by the Ontario Municipal Board to uphold their own piece of legislation, and you have activists caught in this crazy web. It should not have got this far, because the Ontario Municipal Board ruled in favour of the developers and said, “Take an additional 1,000 hectares on it”—it’s not acres; it’s hectares—which is huge, which costs the existing taxpayers money. It has environmental costs. It has planning consequences. How can that happen?", "Of course you have activists who have raised their concerns about this, because, as I mentioned, there is more than just the financial cost of infrastructure that we can’t afford to maintain and uphold, and you have the environmental costs of really irresponsible planning.", "This piece of legislation would protect them. It would protect them against some very big players. The member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound criticizes us for—I mean, that’s what they are. They have a lot of money. They have deep pockets. They do. They can be part of the solution, but what the government’s job is, by bringing in legislation, and what our job is, as an opposition party, is to ensure that there is legislation which levels the playing field, if you will, because it needs to be levelled. The voices and the citizens of these communities who care deeply about their community—and they don’t want to see sprawling growth or irresponsible energy pipelines going through their community, because they’ve weighed the risk, and they feel that the risk for them is to stand up and speak out. A piece of legislation which at least protects them to actually do that is a good piece of legislation, and, as I said, we can do better.", "I really want to end by just commenting on Commissioner Gord Miller, what he wrote on this. He said, “The public’s right to participate in decision-making over matters of public interest is a cornerstone of our democratic system. Efforts aimed at suppressing this right should be discouraged by the Ontario Legislature and other public agencies. The” environmental commissioner “sees a need for provincial legislation that would put both sides of development disputes on equal footing. Such legislation could serve to halt SLAPP suits in their tracks.”", "I think that Bill 52 is a very good place to start. I think that there are some gaps in it, as I’ve already identified, that we can actually strengthen at committee. I hope that the government is receptive to that, because it doesn’t make any sense to bring a piece of legislation which still has weak spots, because it took so long to get here. It took so long to get to March 2015 after the panel made their recommendations in 2010. Why not move this forward, address the weaknesses at committee and get it done—get it done the right way—so that citizens in this province feel empowered and supported to stand up and speak out on issues that they care deeply about?" ],

This lady has not been hit with a SLAPP suit, but the National Energy Board has gathered 1,031 pages of documents which reference her name in her fight to stop or delay Line 9, the oil pipeline. If a lawsuit is launched and you’ve got to go out and hire a lawyer, and the first thing you have to give the lawyer is more than 1,000 pages for review, look at the added cost there.

It’s scary, Speaker; it really is.", "Here’s somebody who has intervener status trying to delay that, and she did because she pointed out, quite rightfully so, that at the Grand River there was only one emergency shut-off valve, and that’s a scary thing. That should send a chill through us all that they were going to put this pipeline through—I think it was 300,000 barrels of oil a day going through there—with one emergency shut-off valve at the Grand River in Kitchener–Waterloo. When they gather that kind of information about somebody through media reports, that this lady is standing up for her community—if that ever got to a lawsuit, the cost of that would be tremendous. We should all be very concerned about that." ],

In 1988, I joined municipal council, and some of my colleagues here spent a lot of years on municipal council. It’s kind of interesting listening to everybody in the chamber speak on this particular bill, the Protection of Public Participation Act. If you look back in history, the creation of the OMB has led to this issue because the OMB was created as a quasi-judicial body. It wasn’t meant to have lawyers, but the development industry has been so savvy over the years that they’ve brought lawyers into the system. Right now, the OMB is really not a judicial system that is supposed to be quasi-, supposed to be friendly; it’s a court. Unfortunately, it has led to some of these letters from lawyers to residents who want to do the right thing for their community.", "This bill has been a long-standing problem. Many of the people who spoke before have mentioned that this bill has been introduced more than once. In fact, this is the fourth time. Everybody’s speaking positively about the bill, so I hope this time around we’ll get it on to committee. We will cut off debate soon and let the committee deal with it quickly. We have an opportunity in this session of the Legislature to approve something. Let us approve it.", "But I’m going to tell you the truth, Mr. Speaker. I know everybody’s saying the bill’s not perfect, and we’ll correct it at committee. But I have my doubts that it will solve the problem 100% because the OMB with lawyers still exists. I have no confidence that this is going to solve it. This is just one tool in the arsenal of tools that we’re giving communities to defend themselves, and I hope it works." ],

I mean, they are creating policy on the side, almost, by overruling local municipalities. I agree with you: They were never meant to lawyer up and work against the people in their communities.

This is what this piece of legislation really does.", "I’m hopeful that once we reach—and we have to have adequate debate. Let’s be reasonable, we shouldn’t short-change anybody—and that this goes to committee, because frankly, in any committee I’ve sat on for the eight or nine years I’ve spent in this place—I tell people that’s really where a lot of the work gets done, because you’re able to listen to interested parties that are not allowed to come to this House to debate with us, but give us their good input; and all three parties have an opportunity to look at what this should look like at the end of the day.", "I’m just going to take a minute to review what really the intent of this piece of legislation is. We live in a very fair and democratic society, although sometimes we wonder, but we do. I think we need to protect that a little bit more. We can speak out on matters that are important to us. By protecting citizens against strategic litigation, the government is standing up for those values. I think it’s important we do that. Frankly, Speaker, that’s what the people of Ontario want, that’s what they cherish.", "Using intimidation tactics to silence someone’s opponents is a misuse of our court system. It’s one of the central institutions of a fair and democratic society. That’s the democratic piece. I think that’s one of those signatures that, as Ontarians, as Canadians, we need to be proud of, and sometimes we take that too much for granted. We need to remember that.", "If passed, this legislation will allow the courts to quickly identify and deal with strategic lawsuits, minimizing the emotional and financial strains for defendants as well as the waste of court resources. Now, we hear over and over again, Speaker, is this something that’s going to fix all those problems that we’ve encountered? I would say not, but I think it creates an opportunity to make those circumstances better.", "I think this proposed legislation, once again, if passed, strikes somewhat of a real balance that will help to ensure that abusive litigation is stopped but that legitimate action can continue, because we don’t want to go too far to the other side. We’ve got to leave the opportunity for that to still happen. So I think it’s important that we do this.", "I think we need to look at this piece of legislation as it strikes that balance, at the end of the day, after public hearings. What we’ll end up with is a made-in-Ontario approach that suits our needs as Ontarians in addressing these issues with the strategic lawsuits. It will have some opportunity to build on consensus. As I said before, it’s something that—I think everybody strives to get there. At the same time, we need to protect public debate, which is part of our comprehensive strategy to build a better justice system.", "Speaker, you’ve heard some references made to the OMB. I think the OMB, although sometimes somewhat cumbersome, does serve that purpose. Unfortunately, sometimes we use a sledgehammer to deal with an issue that, frankly, could be resolved in a strategic manner. By passing this legislation, I think it will take some of the pressures off the OMB to try to resolve some of these issues.", "As we go ahead with this debate, I would really ask all the members of this House to look at the end result. I think sometimes we focus too much on trying to have a magic bullet that fixes all the problems, and that the problems will go away. But I think we need to focus: Is this the right approach to go from point A to point B? Frankly, point A is not sustainable. The leader of the NDP, some time back, introduced a piece of legislation similar to what we’re debating today.", "I think this will really play a role in trying to mitigate some of those issues that, frankly, even through an OMB process, will try to smooth that process.", "Speaker, as I finish my remarks here, I just hope that we use some common sense to get from point A to point B, knowing that it might not fix all the problems but certainly will smooth that road to move forward.", "At this time, I will turn it over to my good friend the Minister of Education to take on the debate." ],

On all these issues, there is a real public interest in having a public debate about the pros and the cons of whatever is the issue that’s under debate.", "We want to ensure, to protect our democratic institutions, and quite frankly, to arrive at good, considered conclusions to the debate, that we actually have mechanisms to involve the public and to allow the public to comment and to have the public bring forward their ideas about how various issues can be resolved.", "So as it says in the name of the act, the goal of the act is to protect public participation. The problem we’re addressing here is that sometimes the developer or the proponent of whatever developer slaps a lawsuit on whoever is disagreeing with them, the public participant, to try and shut them down because they’re afraid of the lawsuit, they’re afraid of the litigation, they’re afraid that they’re being charged with libel or defamation or whatever, and somebody slaps a frivolous lawsuit on.", "Back in 2010, the issue started to arise as to whether this was actually a problem in Ontario and in Canada. Fortuitously, I guess, we often seem in Canada and in Ontario to lag the litigation history in the US. But it seems that unfortunately where people in the US come up with some new reason to sue each other, give it a few years and we seem to pick up the practice in Ontario. So the issue arose: Are strategic lawsuits a problem in Ontario?", "At that point, back in 2010, the Ministry of the Attorney General actually convened an expert panel to look at the issue of strategic lawsuits and to recommend steps that could be taken to prevent them. After extensive consultations—public participation, if you will—the panel concluded that strategic lawsuits are indeed a problem in Ontario, potentially deterring significant numbers of people from speaking out on matters of public interest. We don’t know the definite number of lawsuits, because when you table a strategic lawsuit, you don’t stick a little gold sticker on it saying, “Hi, I’m a strategic lawsuit.” That just simply is a characterization. But what the panel was able to determine was that while these suits are not labelled as strategic lawsuits when they’re filed with the court, nevertheless they were strategic lawsuits, and it has become a problem. Hence, what we’ve got here today is Bill 52.", "As has been noted several times, this is actually the fourth incarnation of this bill: twice as a private member’s bill and now this is the second government bill version. Hopefully this time it won’t die on the order paper, we won’t get prorogued and there won’t be an election, and we will actually get around to passing this bill.", "But I think there has actually been a really interesting debate here this afternoon on some of the pros and cons when you’re dealing with anti-SLAPP legislation, because the thing that you want to make sure of is that while you protect the public participant from a frivolous lawsuit by a developer or a company, you don’t go too far and make a company or a developer open to litigation or lack of remedy when somebody is interfering with a legitimate business enterprise. I think it has really been interesting to hear the debate go back and forth this afternoon with people talking about the possibilities.", "I think what’s important here is that we can have confidence that the panel that was appointed by the Ministry of the Attorney General very much turned their mind to the fairness issue, that we need to have a balanced approach that is fair to both the democratic participants at the community level and whoever is the proponent of the project that is under debate, and that we can be assured that the proposed law—which actually does put into law a number of the recommendations that have come from the panel; that in fact that is where we’re going, and that we do have a fair and reasonable definition of what is a strategic lawsuit and when this law would click in. Quite frankly, if there’s a little bit of fine-tuning that’s needed, if we get this through second reading, it can go to committee, and if people still have concerns that it needs fine-tuning at the committee stage, we can do that.", "I would encourage everyone in this House to vote for this legislation.

That’s a huge concern for me.", "I’ve also received correspondence from FONOM, the Federation of Northern Ontario Municipalities, and they have made a number of recommendations to try to improve the bill, especially in terms of clarifying the intent of the legislation and classifying who it protects. I’ll quote from their letter to me:", "“We believe the proposed legislation would be strengthened by specifying that the intent of the law is to protect individuals and citizens whose public participation is in good faith and factual in nature.” They go on to say, “Specifically, Bill 52 would be enhanced if it specified that the legislation was intended to cover individuals and groups that are voluntary in nature, have annual operating budgets below a specified threshold, perhaps $100,000, and do not have a legal counsel engaged either pro bono or as a cost to the individual or to the group.” I think that is an excellent recommendation.", "I look forward to having an opportunity to speak more fully to this bill, where I will concentrate on the Ontario Forest Industries Association’s and FONOM’s concerns, as well as others.

But I’m not here to talk about how I receive my information.", "The reason that I was in that lawsuit related to the Caledonia Six Nations issue, which I consider the mother of all scandals—we think of eHealth: Nobody has written a book about eHealth yet. Ornge: Nobody has written a book about Ornge. The gas plant scandal: Nobody has written a book about that. The Sudbury scandal: Maybe someone’s working on a book. There are no books out on that scandal. The Caledonia Six Nations scandal: There have now been at least four books written about that issue, and I recommend that you take a look at these four books, written from all perspectives—the mother of all scandals." ],

  "text" : [ "Yes, he’s looking for something to do.", "More specifically to the SLAPP tactics, for me, this goes back to 2008 during public hearings. That’s when I first heard the expression. We were having public hearings on the Lake Simcoe Protection Act. That bill at the time was Bill 99. We called it the Wayne Gretzky bill. That was eight years ago. We still don’t have this in place as yet; it has been introduced four times.", "Just going back to that Lake Simcoe confrontation, much of it focused on Big Bay Point on Lake Simcoe. You can read about the lawsuits and the bitter feud between cottagers and developers. Anyone who is interested in getting a journalist’s take on what was going on there, take a look at Toronto Life magazine. There’s an article by Paul Wilson, and it’s titled “The Battle over Lake Simcoe.” We’re told in the article in Toronto Life that in that battle, at that point—now, that was eight years ago when that the article came out—there were $255 million in lawsuits. One person who approached the witness table before our committee was subject to a $1-million lawsuit, which was felt to be a SLAPP lawsuit. I know, from the committee, that it did have an impact on that person. They testified anyway, but they were subject to that kind of intimidation in what was referred to at the time as the mother of all development wars.", "Then we had recent mention of northern Ontario, the ongoing war in the woods. I was with the Mike Harris government a number of years ago, and we resolved much of that at that time with our approach to northern Ontario. But we do see the other side of the story. We heard from one of the members about the concerns of the Ontario Forest Industries Association with this SLAPP legislation, and the concerns of FONOM, the municipal organization. So there is the other side of the story.", "In a case, Greenpeace, as I’m told, launched a series of frivolous actions or complaints against a forest company. It was Resolute Forest Products. They were harvesting trees, making paper and selling the paper to Best Buy, a retail store chain. Greenpeace asked Resolute to not harvest the forest in, I think, half of northern Ontario, or Greenpeace would pressure their customer Best Buy to not use their paper. Resolute did sign an agreement with Greenpeace stating that they would do as Greenpeace asked if Greenpeace agreed to stop their negative campaign against Best Buy.", "Two weeks later, Greenpeace started up this aggressive negative campaign again, targeting the customers of Best Buy: “Don’t buy these paper products.” Resolute, in turn—they had the right to their day in court—filed a lawsuit against Greenpeace for breach of contract and damages. From what I understand, this is a legitimate lawsuit by a company against an environmental organization.", "We know that this is going to committee. We support this legislation with some caveats, and I do hope some appropriate safeguards are put in place so we don’t go too far the other way. We do have to achieve some balance to ensure that those appropriate or legitimate lawsuits can go forward. In our society, we do have the right to have our day in court.", "We see the support for this Liberal bill—and I’m just trying to read between the lines—from Greenpeace. We see support from Environmental Defence, Ecojustice, CELA—that’s the Canadian Environmental Law Association—the Ontario Clean Air Alliance, the Council of Canadians, the Sierra Club and the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario. So often they’re on that list, and the list goes on and on. These groups support the legislation. As with a lot of the environmental legislation I’ve seen over the last 11 years, they’ve probably had a major hand in writing this legislation, and we can only trust that they got it right and did it in an unbiased way.", "Going back to the Lake Simcoe example, the war at Big Bay Point: This war was described as one of the messiest and most acrimonious in recent history. It was a compelling issue for so many people, people either trying to protect what they already had on the shoreline or trying to move forward with development, and it’s unfortunate when it boils down to these kinds of lawsuits.", "John Tory was our leader at the time. I remember at the time that he made an announcement that the PC government would clean up Lake Simcoe. He was joined in that announcement by Garfield Dunlop from Simcoe North, Jim Wilson from Simcoe–Grey, Julia Munro from York North and also MPP Joe Tascona. I think I can mention his name, Speaker; he’s not here now, but he represented Barrie–Simcoe–Bradford.", "There was heavy involvement on our side. There was heavy involvement from the federal government, partly a $30-million initiative through John Baird, who was environment minister at the time, and MPs around the lake: Bruce Stanton; Patrick Brown—there’s a name that’s a little more known now than six or nine months ago; Bev Oda, another name that ended up in the media; Barry Devolin and Peter Van Loan.", "The downside were these kinds of lawsuits and the intimidation going on around the lake. At that time, on committee, we realized, I certainly realized, that these kinds of lawsuits that people were being exposed to—the sole purpose was to try to shut them up, to silence them or perhaps to punish them for holding an opposing viewpoint. I think we’ve heard the expression here about “litigation chill.”", "Part of what defines a SLAPP is that it is a meritless case and is intended more to intimidate or punish the defendant, rather than to seek justice for any wrong suffered by the plaintiff. Typically, these SLAPPs are withdrawn shortly before going to trial—I’ve had that experience with another lawsuit, now that I think about it—but by that time they’ve already served their purpose: They’ve forced the defendant to go through an extended period of duress, and often a great cost financially, to prepare for an impending court case.", "Some of the things that I heard on that standing committee with respect to Lake Simcoe—first up, the first group that testified was the Innisfil District Association. It’s a ratepayers’ group with about 700 members. They had a very thorough report. The Innisfil group pointed out concerns with regard to some proposed alterations to the shoreline, and they stated that the project represented a situation where the developer was going to be allowed to dig an inland lake of 30 acres next to Lake Simcoe to accommodate 1,000 boats and a mega-marina. That seemed a little over the top to us. This could present a further threat to, at that time, the deteriorating condition of Lake Simcoe.", "As they indicated and asked us as a committee, “The government must provide protection for its citizens from strategic lawsuits.” This was eight years ago. These are the SLAPPS, strategic lawsuits against public participation. They went on to say, “Lawsuits outstanding against our members, lawyers and other critics of the Big Bay Point projects now total over $90 million.” That’s just the one ratepayer’ group of 700 people. I’m sure you can pass the hat, but $90 million is a significant amount of money.", "As they indicated, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act is “meaningless unless residents can speak out openly against projects that threaten the environment.” That was eight years ago, Speaker, and the clock continues to tick on this one. One of their recommendations at the time: “This government should move quickly, as Quebec has done, to guarantee that citizens be allowed to participate free from the chill of developer lawsuits.”", "I do recall that the presenter paused at the beginning, looked around somewhat furtively, looked at the audience behind him and indicated that he was, at the time, subject to a million-dollar lawsuit. I found that disturbing. I felt for him.", "We were having these hearings just a few days after Remembrance Day. We all understand in this House why people stepped forward on our behalf and fought on our behalf, and it was to have those kinds of freedoms to not only assemble, like on the standing committee, but to be able to speak one’s mind without any suggestion of intimidation.", "I support this legislation with certain caveats. We’re eight years down the road now. Bill 52, as we know, establishes a legal procedure. So often many of us are involved in public issues, but what the proponents can do is—those are the people fighting the issue with deep pockets—they can move it out of the public realm into the legal realm, where they clearly have the advantage.", "So Bill 52, if it’s enacted, allows people to prove, again before a judge, that the legal proceedings that are brought against them arise from a communication they made in good faith regarding the public interest, and if the judge is satisfied that this is the case, the legal proceedings would be dismissed as it would, in effect, be determined to be a SLAPP lawsuit. Of course, if the judge is not satisfied, the legal proceedings would continue on.", "At the time—and I’m not up to date on this, but I did some work at the time eight years ago on the business of SLAPP—the province of Quebec had introduced legislation against this kind of intimidation. We asked our legislative researcher assigned at the time to the Standing Committee on General Government to provide us some information on these kinds of lawsuits. It was kind of a new thing for many of us. SLAPP was described as a term used to describe lawsuits initiated by plaintiffs, typically corporations, to stifle criticism of their actions. Such lawsuits are often filed in environmental or land disputes against members of the public or public interest organizations.", "The legislative researcher made a number of points for us—again, this is back in 2008: (1) Very few of these SLAPPs end up going to trial. However—and this is understandable—critics charge that such suits are typically filed to divert the defendants’ resources and shift the venue from the political to the legal realm, where the plaintiff enjoys the advantage.", "(2) Most of these SLAPPs plead multiple causes of action, such as defamation, interference with contractual relations.", "This was presented to the standing committee—(3) Defendants and other critics may become intimidated and cease their political interventions as a consequence.", "The issue of intimidation: Again, that’s somewhat dear to my heart. I’ve made reference to this before: As the representative of Haldimand county and Caledonia, I was formerly elected representative for much of Brant county. I represented New Credit reserve. I represented—six years.", "I personally witnessed a significant amount of intimidation over the last nine years, and intimidation that in one way or another has been actually going on for well over 200 years with respect to land disputes, in this case specifically the Douglas Creek Estates subdivision down in the town of Caledonia. I made mention that you do pay the price when you speak out, and that applies to everybody in this House. I can put a dollar figure on one of my lawsuits, the $260 billion. That would clear out my pension plan if I had one. I guess that applies to anyone else here.", "It doesn’t matter whether you’re named in a million-dollar lawsuit—and I was named in one that was probably the value of my house at the time, and that was very stressful for me for about a year—or a $260-billion lawsuit. I really had trouble getting my head around that one. But it can intimidate one. It can make you think twice about speaking freely and openly about some of the things that the people you represent are concerned about. Like many here, I represent about 110,000 people.", "I’m running out of time, Speaker, but going back to Quebec, the Quebec Minister of Justice at that time introduced a bill that also had the same number: It was Bill 99 again, another Wayne Gretzky bill. I don’t have time to read the long title. I do know that there was an election in Quebec. That one fell off the order paper, and maybe someone else could update us on what they have done in the province of Quebec to perhaps provide some guidance for us in our deliberations.", "Thank you very much, Speaker." ],

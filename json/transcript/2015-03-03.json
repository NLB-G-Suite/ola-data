Just so you know, everybody relax; I will be taking the full 60 minutes.", "You see, this bill contains previous bills of mine that I have been working on for a very, very long time. To be more precise, Bill 45 includes three schedules.", "The first one is an act about healthy menu choices. Basically what this is all about is that it has to do with menu labelling. You will remember, Speaker—and I will go through the different iterations of that bill through time—that this is an issue that I have been pushing since 2009 that has now been picked up by this government and included in Bill 45.", "The second schedule deals with amendments to the smoke-free act to ban flavoured tobacco. Here again, I have been working on trying to ban flavoured tobacco in Ontario since 2008. I’m quite happy to see that it’s now receiving second reading under the government’s Bill 45.", "Schedule three talks about what is known as e-cigarettes, vaporizers or vapours, whichever one you want to call them, but basically to bring regulation to e-cigarettes.", "I will be going through this bill in the order that the bill is written. Not that I care about menu labelling more than banning flavoured tobacco; all of those health promotion issues are important to me. This is why I have been working on them for such a long time.", "Ce matin, ça me fait plaisir de parler au sujet du projet de loi 45. Le projet de loi 45 contient vraiment trois parties.", "La première partie, c’est de mettre les calories sur le menu. Comme ça, lorsque les gens iront, disons, à McDonald’s, vous pourrez voir, « Big Mac : 3,99 $ et 455 calories. »", "La deuxième partie du projet de loi : on veut s’assurer qu’il n’y aura plus de tabac aromatisé en Ontario. C’est quelque chose sur quoi je travaille depuis très longtemps, et je vais vous raconter un peu de l’histoire de comment on en est venu à ça.", "La troisième partie s’adresse aux cigarettes électroniques. En ce moment, il n’y a aucune loi ou règlement qui s’applique aux cigarettes électroniques, et je crois que, parce qu’elles gagnent en popularité, c’est le temps que le gouvernement s’en mêle et qu’on commence à mettre certains règlements. Je commence.", "So let’s start with menu labelling. It’s always nice to see where this comes from. The statistics to encourage menu labelling are rather stark. Basically, things have changed. People used to cook at home. At home, we go to the grocery store. At the grocery store, when we buy food, pretty well every packaged food comes with nutritional information.", "Ontarians are smart. They look at those labels and they make healthy choices. A lot of brands have changed their recipes. A lot of brands now advertise things like zero cholesterol or zero calories, and they will tell you right on the front of the package. But it doesn’t matter what’s on the front of the package, because on the back of every single prepackaged item that you buy in the grocery store, you get menu information—you get a lot of information. Given that more and more people eat in restaurants—we say that Ontarians right now consume one fifth of their food in restaurants—we think that the time has come to do the shift from the information you get on the back of packaged food, to bring it to the front of the menu.", "When I first introduced this bill—it has been quite a while, Speaker; I will go through the history of it a little bit. I will always remember when I first introduced this bill, because I was sitting in this chamber, in that seat right there. The galleries were full. It was a Thursday afternoon. It tends to be quiet in here on a Thursday afternoon, but not that Thursday afternoon. That Thursday afternoon, I was sitting in this seat, and the gallery on the east side was packed with people from the restaurant associations who had come to lobby against the bill.", "At the time I had introduced the bill for the first time, it was Bill 156. It was called the Healthy Decisions for Healthy Eating Act. I introduced it on March 10, 2009, and that bill at the time required food premises with total gross annual revenue greater than $5 million to disclose nutritional information for the food and drinks served, and to limit the amount of trans fats in restaurant food and drinks.", "The bill was debated for second reading. Once it made it to second reading, this is when a rare thing happened, actually. After we had debated it, I could see that some people were very much in support of it and some people were very much against it. A free vote was held where—except for my party, where everybody voted in favour—from the Liberal and the Conservative sides, some people voted for and some people voted against. To my—" ],

It was the first time it had been introduced in this House; it was debated; there were pros and cons and it passed by three votes.", "The people in the gallery—if looks could kill, I would be dead at this point, never to tell this story, because they were frankly not happy. They had all come with their little uniforms on, saying name brands of big chain restaurants on their jackets or t-shirts. We knew who they were, and we knew why they were here: They were here to oppose the bill. So I did what every good politician would do: After the bill had passed second reading, I met with the industry. I sat down with all of them: the beverage association, the restaurant association. I met with all of them who wanted to come and talk to me and tried to listen and tried to see what kind of compromise we could make. How could we move this forward?", "They were pushing very hard for what they called at the time nutrition information packaging. It became the Informed Dining program in 2011, but back then—because we’re still in 2009, 2010—it was called the nutrition information program. That was a voluntary program where the restaurant industry—most of them had agreed that they would participate in this and that a bill forcing them to do things was not necessary because they were going to do this out of the industry working together. They were going to put that forward, and they showed it to me and how it was supposed to work and all of this, and it looked pretty convincing, like it would work. It had some good points to it.", "But this is now 2015, Speaker. When was the last time that you saw right on the menu board the number of calories? It did not happen. Instead, what we got was—the restaurants did do their homework. They did calculate all of the nutritional information that is in their food. They standardized their portions. If you are a zealous person like myself, before you go to the restaurant you can go on their website, pre-order what you’re going to feel like eating that night once you get there and check out everything that’s going to be on that; or, I suppose, you could always flip it out in between your appetizer and main course and check it out on your cellphone—not really that convenient.", "Some have them on a—if you have a tray, sometimes it’s at the bottom of the tray or you can flip your little placemat upside down and you’ll get that information. Sometimes it’s on the way to the bathroom. You will have those great big posters on the way to the bathroom giving you all of the nutritional information of the food that they offer. Sometimes it’s on a free brochure.", "Because I’ve been working on that bill for so much time, I now have a habit that whenever I go into a place where I know they should post the nutritional information, I ask for this brochure. I can tell you that it doesn’t matter if I’m in Sudbury, if I’m in Toronto or if I’m anywhere in between, when you ask for this brochure, the charming little person at the cash looks at you like you’re from Mars, then realizes that, “Oh, well, this lady is not going to go away, so I might as well start to look for the brochure.” The entire underneath of the restaurant gets flipped upside down, and sometimes out of a dusty box comes this little brochure that they dust off and give to me, and then you can calculate your information.", "This is not working, Speaker. You’re getting what I’m getting at? This is not working, which is why I reintroduced the Healthy Decisions for Healthy Eating Act on May 8, 2012. The first time I introduced it, it passed second reading. After second reading, we had a majority Liberal government. They knew exactly what they were going to do with this: They were going to can it. They never called it to committee. Committee had lots of time to deal with it. The committee went on holiday, and the bill never moved forward.", "But I don’t give up easy, Speaker. I reintroduced it in May 8, 2012; same name but I had made some concessions. I had spoken with the industry and, by then, I had taken out the regulation that had to do with trans fats. I realized that it was something that was being worked on at the federal level. There were possibilities.", "The second time, it basically looked like the first. It would require chain restaurants to display the number of calories in each item, make nutritional brochures available—remember, the dusting off—and indicate clearly which items have high and very high sodium.", "By 2012, we’re not talking about trans fats that much anymore because the industry convinced me that that was just too hard a step to take, but sodium was something that we could work on. So it was put in. In May 2012, I introduced it. The industry reacted but not so negatively, but I can tell you that it received a lot of support. Let me go through some of the people that supported it in a minute, as soon as I find my notes. The problem with having the same bill come over and over and over is that you end up with a lot of notes. I’m in this position where I have a lot of notes.", "Okay, so the people that supported it continue to grow, and the shift started towards posting the calories and the sodium. I’m sure my list of people will pop out of my—oh, here it is. So, at this point, we have the Alberta Public Health Association that supported it, the Alberta Policy Coalition for Chronic Disease Prevention, the Alliance for the Prevention of Chronic Disease, the Association of Ontario Health Centres, the medical director of the Bariatric Medical Institute, the Canadian Association for Enterostomal Therapy, the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists, the Canadian Association of Perinatal and Women’s Health Nurses, the public health associations—Canadian and Ontario—the Canadian Stroke Network, the Canadian Women’s Health Network and the Canadian Council of Cardiovascular Nurses.", "It goes on: The Canadian Diabetes Association and the Canadian Gerontological Nursing Association. We have Eldon Smith, who is a professor emeritus and the former chair of the Canadian Heart Health Strategy. We have the Canadian Orthopaedic Nurses Association, the Centre for Science in the Public Interest, Cancer Care Ontario, CancerCare Manitoba, the Childhood Obesity Foundation, la Coalition québécoise sur la problématique du poids, the College of Family Physicians of Canada, the DisAbled Women’s Network and the Dietitians of Canada. We also have the chair in hypertension prevention and control, the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario, the BC Child and Youth Advocacy Coalition and the Fitness Industry Council of Canada.", "We have Hypertension Canada. We have a number of people from nutrition consulting. We have the Licensed Practical Nurses Association of BC, the Ontario Home Economics Association and the Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada; although they will come back when we talk about flavoured tobacco, they also support nutritional labelling. We have the Prevent Cancer Now Board. We have the Public Health Physicians of Canada. We have the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario. We have the Sport Matters Group, a group from Ottawa. We have the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, and the list goes on and on.", "I’m sure by now I’m making Hansard a little bit nervous, but not to worry; they’re all written down, and I will share the list with them.", "So the story goes: The first time, a little bit of support and a huge pushback. The second time, I had made some concessions with the industry, and they were still not thrilled—I won’t lie—but they were starting to come to the realization that this is a done deal and they could work with us or face a hard time. More and more people were coming into the tent. More and more people had had a chance to look at the bill and look at other jurisdictions that have passed similar laws and what had happened.", "One of the first ones that did that was New York state in 2008. Since 2008, if you go to McDonald’s, Subway or Tim Hortons—because they have Tim Hortons even down there—you will see the same menu offerings that we have up here. The price sometimes is a little bit different, but the number of calories is exactly the same as what we can find, except that in the States they have it on the menu board. They have it directly on the menu. The exact same menu in Canada does not have that information.", "Just so that you know, most of those big chains change those menus boards about every four months. Through the research we found a brand that only changed their menu board about every six months. But, basically, they have the information. They do this in other jurisdictions—the exact same menu, the exact same thing—all we’re asking is for them to bring that information to Ontario.", "So we’re now in May 2008, I reintroduced the Healthy Decisions for Healthy Eating Act—menu labelling, number of calories, but we’re also starting to talk about sodium, and I will explain that to you a little bit later. I reintroduced the bill also in 2012, but that time on October 2. What I had done is—in a few minutes, I will talk to you about the work I’ve done on flavoured tobacco—but, basically, on October 2, I decided, “Well, everybody in this House has talked about menu labelling, they’ve talked about flavoured tobacco enough,” and at the time, there were also regulations for tanning beds. So what I did was I put them all into one bill. I called the bill Healthy Decisions Made Easy, and it included three parts that had to do with health promotion: the regulation of tanning beds, menu labelling and flavoured tobacco.", "Unfortunately, two days before I was to bring this to second reading—I had a horde of people ready to support the bill from all parts of the province, people coming down from up north and all of this—Mr. McGuinty prorogued. I never got to debate it. I felt like this was directed at me. He had prorogued because he didn’t want my fabulous bill to go through. I’m told there were other reasons why he prorogued, maybe like a billion-dollar gas plant scandal, but to me, it was personal. It was because he didn’t want my bill to go through." ],

I don’t give up easy.", "Come April 29, 2013, I reintroduced the Healthy Decisions for Healthy Eating Act. At this point, the bill required chain restaurants to display the number of calories on each item, make nutritional brochures available and indicate clearly which items have high and very high sodium At the time, it was the idea that if any items on the menu had more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium, they would get a double check mark, and if they had more than 750 milligrams of sodium, they would get a single check mark to indicate that it was high or very high in sodium. That was what I intended to do at the time.", "It’s rather interesting because if you look at what Health Canada currently defines as “high sodium,” they put it at 360 milligrams of sodium. The problem with this is—and this is very, very sad—that if I was to take Health Canada’s definition of high sodium, it would become meaningless because every single item at, let’s say, McDonald’s, would be checkmarked. Here again—not to pick on McDonald’s, but you are it this morning—if we go to 1,500 milligrams of sodium, only four items on the McDonald’s menu would make it, and if we go to 750 milligrams of sodium, then we’re close to 35 out of 300 offerings at McDonald’s.", "I’m telling you all of these boring numbers, because there is a lot of salt in the food that we consume in restaurants, so finding the right thing to do—by that time, in April 2013, I had gone with the high and very high sodium, putting those thresholds quite high—1,500 is very close to the daily limit, and you would have this in one item. Think about it: If you go to any fast food—I won’t pick on McDonald’s—and if a large amount of their food offerings have over your daily dosage, if you happen to order three or four food items, such as a burger and fries and something else—an apple pie—you will be eating a ton of salt. So this is what I did on April 29, 2013, and we prorogued yet again, so I’m not done.", "I reintroduced it on November 25, 2014, and that time, I really looked at putting the number of calories next to the menu item but also putting on the number of milligrams of sodium. If you go on the Internet, you will be able to pull menus from jurisdictions in the States. The big chains have started to do this. It is feasible to put that on the menu without having a cluttered menu, and people do use this information.", "The way we have it in Canada right now, one person out of 1,000—those are geeks like me, Speaker—uses the information the way we have it: on the website, on the menu board, on the poster as they go to the bathroom etc. The other 999 customers don’t use that information, because it is not user-friendly.", "If you put it right there on the menu board, one person out of two will use it to make an informed choice. On average, they will consume about 19% less calories and, as a bit of an added bonus for the restaurant industry, they tend to switch their choices. They still go just as much as they used to before. They just make different selections on the menu, and they tend to spend a little bit more. They spend a little bit more, make healthy choices and consume 19% less calories.", "I think we’re starting to head toward a win-win, where the restaurant industry has come to the realization that this information is valuable, that this information will help Ontarians make healthier choices, that it is feasible to put that information on the menu and menu board, and that it should be there.", "Of course, Speaker, you will know that Bill 45, the way it is written now, talks about calorie labelling, but it does not include sodium. It does not include the amount of salt. I say that we have been working at this for long enough. People have had enough time to talk about it. It has been talked about in the press many, many times, to the point that, in the last survey that was done—it was a Canada-wide survey, not just here in Ontario—92% of Canadians, and that includes Ontarians, want to see that information. They want to see the number of calories on the menu, and they want to see the amount of sodium.", "A 92% consensus on anything is quite extraordinary. We all know that in this day and age, some people would be offered paradise and would vote against it. That we have 92% of people in Canada, including Ontario, who want this to happen, I think, basically behooves us to do the right thing: to make sure, when we have an opportunity to go through clause-by-clause with Bill 45, when we have an opportunity to make changes to this bill, that not only do we support what’s in there for calorie labelling, but that we make sure we include sodium. Whether it is with a check mark for “high” or “very high”—I could live with this, but I think it would be way more preferable to simply put the amount of sodium.", "Whether you use that information or not is up to you. But I can tell you, even if you never look at it and you just go and order the same thing you’ve always ordered because your kids like it and it’s easy, it would still help you.", "What happens is that the people that do use that information—it basically motivates the industry to make recipe changes. If you go to a Subway restaurant and order the tuna melt, in Canada, the tuna melt clocks in at 1,825 calories. A sandwich usually is about 350 or 450 calories; you can do the math. This is a lot of calories for the tuna melt. They have changed their recipe in the States so that their preparation has less calories and less salt. Even if you never read it, even if you continue to eat the same thing you’ve always eaten, there’s a good chance that restaurants will change their preparation. That will help all of us because they will offer the same items in a preparation that has less sodium as well as less calories in it.", "Now I see that half of the time has gone by. An hour seems really long when you think about it, but when you’re actually living it, it goes by quite fast. I have lots of menu items that I wanted to share with you to do a little kind of quiz, “Do you think that this has more calories than this other?” We may do the quiz at the end because I don’t want to run out of time." ],

Let me change all of the notes that I have in front of me so that I can do that.", "Flavoured tobacco: The story starts in 2008. In 2008, my very first private member’s bill was to ban flavoured cigarillos. Those things were basically all over my riding. Every couple of weeks that would go by, the number of flavours of those cigarillos would continue to grow, and the number of young people smoking them would continue to grow.", "The type of flavour that was being put forward, the packaging, the marketing, the colouring—all of this was squarely targeted at youth. The tobacco industry was smart enough to realize that cigarettes now come with quite a lot of baggage. They have those ugly pictures on the front, and they’re associated with sickness and all of this. But the single-sale flavoured cigarillos didn’t have any of this. They had no warning on them. They were a buck apiece. If a parent saw them in the backpack of their children, they would have no idea; they looked like lip gloss or a marker. They squarely looked like they fit into a kid’s backpack, like that was where they belonged. And that was wrong.", "My very first private member’s bill was a co-sponsored bill. It was one of the first times that we were allowed to co-sponsor, and I co-sponsored it with the Speaker, Mr. Levac. To my delight, it passed. Not only did it pass second reading, but it passed third reading, it received royal assent, and it became law. Can you imagine, Speaker? I had only been elected to this Legislature for about a year; I got elected in 2007. That was my first private member’s bill, which I debated for second reading in December 2008, and by the time I went home for Christmas in 2008, I was the proud owner of a new bill. I was beaming. I had done—my term was done.", "I had come from 25 years in health care, in health promotion, and here I was able to make changes, and flavoured cigarillos were not going to be available anymore. The day was grand, and it lasted about a day. Because you see, Speaker, the bill gave the industry quite a few months to, in theory, get rid of their inventory. We didn’t want to hurt the little mom-and-pop shop that had bought those things and, all of a sudden, were going to be out the money. So the royal assent gave a number of months for the industry before they had to cease making this product available.", "Well, the industry was not going to sit idle during those months that we had given them to deal with their inventory. Before the ink was really dry on the last production of this bill, they had found a loophole. You see, Speaker, when we defined a flavoured cigarillo, we defined it by the number of grams. It’s really a cigarette. It looks identical to a cigarette. I kept some of them. If you’re interested, come and see me. They’re in my fridge downstairs. They looked identical to a cigarette, except that they were flavoured and they smelled extremely good. I handled those products for a long time. It’s really hard to handle those things and not smoke one up, let me tell you, but that’s for another story.", "When the industry saw that in the bill, all they did is put a milligram more tobacco in their products than what was in before. We had defined a cigarillo by the number of grams because we did not want to catch cigars, which were also flavoured, but they were not a way for kids to pick up cigarette smoking. I suppose some kids will go through this, but so far, at that time in 2008, cigars had never been targeted at youth. It was really the cigarillos, the little cigarettes sold individually with no warnings on them. They were targeting youth. They were targeting the next generation of smokers, and we wanted to get rid of them.", "Well, by the time the bill came into effect, it was absolutely useless. They had added a milligram more tobacco into their products. They continued with the same packaging, the same price, the same marketing strategy and the same number of flavours, and I will tell you that the number of flavours increased dramatically.", "They continue to hook, on average, 90,000 more young people who would start smoking using flavoured tobacco but then get addicted to the nicotine, and after a while they don’t want to suck on something that tastes like a peach, a strawberry, a martini or anything like that. They want the nicotine fix. They switch to cigarettes and they become the next generation of smokers, and we all know that 50% of them will die from it. Tobacco is the only product that, if used as directed, will kill 50% of its users. I’ll let you do the math, Speaker. From 2008 to 2015, times 90,000 more young smokers: That’s a lot of suffering in our future that could have all been avoided.", "So, not to be undone, I said, “Let’s learn from our mistakes. Let’s make sure that the next time we ban flavoured tobacco there will be no loopholes; there will be no definitions. It will be very plain, very blunt and very simple: Ban flavoured tobacco. Full stop.”", "On April 4, 2011, I introduced the Smoke-Free Ontario Amendment Act, banning flavoured tobacco. The bill was to prohibit the sale and distribution of new tobacco products, smokeless tobacco and flavoured tobacco. So not only were we talking about flavoured tobacco, but in this it’s smokeless—think about chews and every other tobacco product—and the banning of new tobacco products, because we know that the tobacco industry’s ingenuity knows no boundaries. They are very creative and very ingenious to make sure that they continue to sell their products, because once they have a customer, the nicotine does the rest. The addiction does the rest. They know that they have a customer for life, until 50% of them die or go through really painful withdrawal to be able to quit this habit.", "That was April 4, 2011. This bill also died on the order paper.", "Not to be undone, I reintroduced it on April 17, 2012, under Bill 66, the Smoke-Free Ontario Amendment Act, which prohibited flavoured tobacco, new tobacco products and smokeless tobacco. The bill was very well received. The number of people who were joining the chorus was bigger and bigger.", "I always remember that Freeze the Industry / Gèle l’industrie had done pens at the time, and the pens read: “Freeze the Industry is advocating for a tobacco moratorium—a ban on all new tobacco products not yet introduced in Canada and on alterations to all current products. We need a moratorium because the tobacco industry continues to develop new, innovative products that: evade and exploit new tobacco legislation designed to protect the health of young Canadians; recruit and retain youth and young adults, since 81% of current and former smokers begin smoking before the age of 18; appear to be less harmful than existing products when in reality they continue to contain the same dangerous ingredients.”", "Freeze the Industry is a group of young people like there are very few of them around. They are dedicated. They are informed. They are eloquent. They are taking on the tobacco industry.", "To me, if there is ever going to be a group that will succeed in taking on the tobacco industry, it will be the youth of our province. I can say thank you, certainly, to the cancer society for their young advocates as well as to Freeze the Industry.", "This is so good, Speaker, that I will tell you in French.", "Depuis la fin des années 2008, 2009, et 2010, Gèle l’industrie a été très actif pour essayer de faire changer les choses. Ils ont fait ce petit stylo, et je vais vous dire ce qu’il dit : « Gèle l’industrie milite pour la création d’un moratoire sur le tabac—une interdiction portant sur tous les nouveaux produits du tabac qui n’ont pas encore été introduits au Canada et sur les modifications apportées à tous les produits actuels.", "« Un moratoire est nécessaire car l’industrie du tabac continue de créer de nouveaux produits innovateurs qui :", "« Échappent aux nouvelles lois sur le tabac ou en exploitent les failles, alors que ces lois visent à protéger la santé des jeunes Canadiens;", "« Permettent d’attirer et de conserver des clients parmi les adolescents et les jeunes adultes, car 81% des fumeurs commencent la cigarette avant l’âge de 18 ans;", "« Semblent moins dommageables pour la santé que les produits existants, alors qu’en fait ils contiennent les mêmes ingrédients nocifs. »", "Ils ont un site Web qui s’appelle gelelindustrie.com.", "That’s what they did back then. They will come back again in my story because, just like me, those young people don’t give up easy.", "In April 2012, I reintroduced the Smoke-Free Ontario Amendment Act trying to ban flavoured tobacco, trying to make sure that no new tobacco products are introduced, as well as smokeless tobacco.", "On October 2, 2012, I introduced Bill 126, Healthy Decisions Made Easy, which I talked about today. You will remember, Speaker, that it talked about menu labelling, about banning flavoured tobacco as well as about tanning beds—which will become law, so we don’t have to worry about that anymore. This bill was reintroduced a number of times, including in the fall of 2014.", "In the fall of 2014, young people from the cancer society came here to Queen’s Park. It was really, really well done. A lot of them were dressed up as flavoured tobacco products. They were dressed up as a grape to show grape-flavoured tobacco or as a cherry because there is cherry tobacco etc. They had a tug-of-war right here on the front steps of Queen’s Park. Quite a few of the MPPs came, and then we held a press conference. Again, it was giving a voice to young people who work with the cancer society and who see the damage that flavoured tobacco is doing to their peers and who see the number of young people who experiment with those tobacco products that are still available and still sold in single cigarillos, still at $1. Although years have passed by, the price has not changed. Because they experimented, they became hooked on to cigarettes and are now tobacco smokers.", "Today, for the launch of my lead, we had Freeze the Industry. Remember the people who gave the nifty pen with a message to all of us? Well, they did it again. Not only did they come and hold a rally in front of Queen’s Park; every MPP will have on their desk this little envelope that says, “Thanks, Ontario.” I won’t use it as a prop—sorry, Speaker.", "I know that most of you have already opened up your envelope, so I will share with you what it says. Basically, it says, “Thanks, Ontario.” It’s a pretty good message, if you ask me. It goes on to say, “There are 2.75 million reasons you are making the right decision by passing Bill 45.” It goes on to say, “FTI”—Freeze the Industry—“is a youth led campaign that raises awareness about how the tobacco industry makes their products appealing to young people. The tobacco industry creates products that are addictive. They target youth by adding flavours and they develop new innovative products which still cause illness and death. FTI wants a moratorium on tobacco products. The first step is a full ban on all flavoured tobacco products including menthol.” I will come back to this in a minute. “To date Freeze the Industry has collected over 10,000 signatures in support of a complete flavour ban. You have the voice of youth in Ontario behind you!” And they’re talking to us.", "They go on with a few statistics:", "—46% of young tobacco product users use flavoured products. Speaker, that’s really close to one in two;", "—73% of youth who use chew tobacco use flavoured products. Those are what in the bill is called smokeless tobacco; on the street, we call them chew;", "—28% of young tobacco product users use menthol products. An estimated 57,300 Ontario youth used flavoured tobacco products in 2013 alone. You know what that means, Speaker? We know what that means. There are 2.75 million young people living in Ontario who will be protected by ensuring a full ban on flavoured tobacco is passed with Bill 45.", "As an added little bonus, they gave us some mints. The irony is not lost on me. They gave us some mints—I’m not allowed to use that, eh? Sorry. They gave us some mints because of the link to menthol. You see, although the bill does include a ban on flavour, they give the tobacco industry years to ban menthol. I rode this bicycle before. I did give a couple of months to the tobacco industry to ban flavoured tobacco, and you all remember what happened. Remember their ingenuity? Remember their creativity? Remember what happened? Well, what happened is that they beat us to the punch. What happened is that the bill became null and void. Although it is on the books in Ontario, you can find flavoured tobacco everywhere. You can find flavoured cigarillos anywhere you go.", "The youth that came this morning to demonstrate in front of Queen’s Park, the youth that organized themselves so that we have this nice thank you on all of our desks, don’t want this big lead time given to the tobacco industry. We will lose. They have way more resources than we have. They have, I would say, desperation on their side, because remember that almost one in four youth—more than one in four; some 28% of young tobacco products users—this is 28% of youth who smoke—smoke menthol. So to say that, “Oh, no, menthol is old people,” people like me and my generation smoke menthol—sure, there are people my age who smoke menthol. But it is also a flavour that is being used more and more by our young people.", "The people who came to Queen’s Park today fully understand that giving the industry years to comply with the law basically means don’t bother passing the law, because it’s never going to see the light of day. It’s going to go down the exact same path that we went down in 2008, when Ontario banned flavoured cigarillos. It will be a bill that does not reach its target.", "I could go on and on, but I see that the time is flying by. Before I go on to e-cigarettes: Monsieur le Président, la partie du projet de loi 45 qui parle d’abolir le tabac aromatisé, c’est très bien. Ça fait des années que j’essaie de faire passer un projet de loi, et je suis bien heureuse que le gouvernement l’ait inclus dans son projet de loi 45 parce que ça va nous permettre d’arriver à la ligne d’arrivée, ou la ligne de fin, beaucoup plus vite.", "Le gouvernement est le seul qui décide le projet de loi dont on parle, et si on n’en parle pas, le projet de loi meurt au feuilleton. Donc, avec un projet de loi du gouvernement, le projet de loi va être capable d’avancer plus vite, et ça, c’est quelque chose de bien. Dans le projet de loi 45, il y a une partie qui dit qu’il n’y aura plus de tabac aromatisé en Ontario, et ça, c’est parfait. C’est quelque chose que les néo-démocrates et moi-même, on essaie de faire avancer ici depuis huit ans.", "Par contre, lorsqu’on parle d’une saveur en particulier, lorsqu’on parle des cigarettes au menthol, là, ils veulent donner à l’industrie plusieurs années avant d’être contrainte par la loi d’arrêter de produire des cigarettes au menthol. Pour nous, ça, de donner à l’industrie autant de temps, c’est un piège dans lequel on est tombé en 2008, ce qui a fait que, vraiment, le projet de loi qui est passé—la loi qui existe en Ontario qui bannit les cigarillos aromatisés—est complètement inefficace parce qu’ils ont étudié la loi en profondeur. Ils ont trouvé une échappatoire dans la loi lorsqu’on avait défini ce que c’était qu’un cigarillo. Ils ont augmenté le nombre de milligrammes de tabac dans le cigarillo pour dire, « Bien, la loi définit le cigarillo à 9 grammes. Nous, on est à 9.01 grammes, donc on peut continuer à vendre nos cigarillos avec les mêmes stratégies, les mêmes saveurs et les mêmes emballages. » Tout est pareil.", "Si on donne à l’industrie jusqu’à deux ans—quand j’ai pris le breffage avec le ministère de la Santé, c’est ce qu’on m’a dit. Il pourrait y avoir un délai de deux ans avant que cette partie-là de la loi ne soit mise en vigueur. Monsieur le Président, l’industrie va trouver une façon de continuer à vendre des cigarettes au menthol, et comme on a vu avec Gèle l’industrie, ça va vouloir dire que le projet de loi va devenir inefficace.", "I will use the few minutes left to talk about e-cigarettes. This is the third schedule of the bill that talks about e-cigarettes. Basically, what the bill will do is regulate the sale, display, promotion and use of e-cigarettes in Ontario.", "Section 2 bans the sale or supply of electronic cigarettes, or any component, to anyone under the age of 19. It will be very similar to tobacco. If a young person wants to buy e-cigarettes or their cartridges or any of the components, if they are over 19 but look like they’re under 25, they will have to produce ID. The products will still be available, but they won’t be available to young people under the age of 19, and there will be laws for using false ID and that kind of stuff.", "The bill will also prohibit e-cigarettes from being viewed or handled by customers before purchase and prohibit the promotion of e-cigarettes inside or outside any place where they are sold. The people who own the places where they’re sold will be allowed to have basic information about e-cigarettes and their price, but people won’t be able to handle them or taste them or do anything of the sort. There will be prohibition on the promotion or sale of e-cigarettes in any place of entertainment, and they will ban the use of e-cigarettes in hospitals, long-term-care homes, pharmacies and other places where you cannot buy e-cigarettes.", "For some of you who have never seen e-cigarettes, they basically look very much like a cigarette. They tend to be a tiny wee bit bigger. If you have gone out to any bars or restaurants where young people gather, I guarantee that you have smelled them. I am old, Speaker, so I remember fully well when we used to go into a restaurant and everybody around me used to smoke. Then there were restaurants where half of the restaurant smoked and the other half didn’t, which was, I guess, a step in the right direction, but it smelled like cigarettes in the whole restaurant; it didn’t matter, basically, where the cigarettes were used.", "It feels like déjà vu all over again, a kind of flashback that I don’t like at all, because now when I walk into a restaurant in my riding or in Sudbury, it becomes quite obvious that a lot of young people are doing what I did when I was young: going into a restaurant and seeing people smoking. It sort of renormalizes smoking, which I thought we had gotten rid of, and were quite happy to have gotten rid of. And here it was coming back and rearing its ugly head.", "Some of them don’t smell like cigarettes at all. Some of them smell like menthol; they don’t smell like cigarettes. But some of them smell exactly the same as if they were smoking cigarettes. There are no regulations about them. Although selling cartridges that have nicotine is supposed to be illegal, there are plenty of cartridges containing nicotine that you can find anywhere. You don’t have to go to Nickel Belt and Sudbury; you can just cross the street right here and you will be able to buy them. We all know what nicotine does: It is very addictive. Whether you use it in a vaporizer or in e-cigarettes or in a cigarillo, you smoke it and it does the same thing to your brain: It tells your brain, “I want this over and over and over again,” and then the addiction starts.", "I would say the body of evidence regarding e-cigarettes as a smoking aid is still in its infancy. So if we find that e-cigarettes used in a certain way can be used as a smoking cessation aid and is successful in doing this, there is room in the regulations to allow for that. But right now, the bill is using the precautionary principle, where you look at making sure that we don’t let young people get access to it, and let’s make sure that when adults start to use this product, they are better informed and the product is better regulated, so that if they say it does not contain nicotine, it doesn’t.", "Right now, you could have the exact same product—and that was one of the studies that kind of surprised me, because there are new studies coming out on this almost every day; I would say every week I read at least three or four new studies on e-cigarettes and vapour lounges and all of this. The claim that it helps people quit smoking is weak. But you can go buy the exact same cartridge of the same flavour and they do not contain the exact same ingredients, depending on the batch, depending on the day that you buy it. So are some of the ingredients in those cartridges damaging to our health? In some cartridges, yes; in some cartridges, a little bit less. But they have the same label, you bought them in the same place, and they said they were identical. But they are not, because those products are completely unregulated. You can buy them in pretty well any corner store down here in Toronto, and you can also order them through the Internet, through—I don’t know—at least 50 different sites that will mail to Canada, if you want to buy some of those.", "I’m not doing promotion of it—far be it from me. All I’m saying is that it is a product that is becoming more and more common. Here, again, the marketing looks very much like what we used to see with the tobacco industry, where they focused on youth with all of the flavours.", "It’s time that these products be at least regulated. As we find out more, through regulations we could make exceptions for people who use them for medical reasons or people who use them to help quit smoking. But the body of evidence is not there.", "Donc, je vais essayer de résumer en une minute ce que j’ai dit pendant une heure. Du côté des néo-démocrates, ça fait longtemps que l’on veut que ces différents projets de loi-là qui ont été réunis dans le projet de loi 45 deviennent réalité. La première partie du projet de loi parle de mettre les calories sur le menu ainsi qu’une indication pour le sodium. La deuxième partie, c’est de ne plus avoir de tabac aromatisé. La troisième partie est vis-à-vis des cigarettes électroniques.", "There are three parts in Bill 45. The first part, menu labelling: New Democrats have been waiting for this for a long time; we’re ready to go. But in 2015, calories is not enough. We have to put in sodium.", "The second part of the bill, that has to do with banning flavour: the sooner, the better. Don’t wait two years before you ban menthol. It has to be done at the same time as every other flavour.", "The third part of the bill, about the e-cigarettes and the precautionary principle: Let’s make sure that we do this right, if new science comes out." ],

It’s about ensuring that the next generation of Ontarians never start to vape. It’s about giving the next generation of Ontarians the choices that many of us didn’t have, growing up, which is to know how many calories there are when you order a doughnut or that cup of coffee.

We need a wholesome strategy to increase daily physical activity for school-aged children and to help our young people make wise decisions when it comes to eating. It’s one thing to put a calorie count on a menu; it’s another thing to enable our next generation to choose wisely when they’re grocery shopping, and how to prepare food.

I’d just like to remind the member—and I’ve been here as long as her; maybe a little bit longer—that when a private member brings a bill, most of the time it’s done with very little research and stakeholder consultation.

That’s where I did my master’s. The report identifies the need for increased awareness of the currently underutilized agri-food post-secondary programs—I know we’re focusing on elementary and secondary, which is also so important—and the need for the creation of new programs to meet the new skills and education required by the industry.", "Of course, the history of agriculture goes back 3,000 years, with the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys, but in the last hundred years, obviously, we’ve come from the pitchfork, which is still used—many of us here probably did grow up forking manure.

They sell the hay to the farm and that type of thing. My son, Andy, who is an excavator operator and a plumber, has a farm as well, and they cash-crop that farm. That’s kind of a deal where I’m always being dragged in, because if it’s not my tools he’s using, he’s asking me to go out and work part-time on the farm, fixing barn doors and trying to get the hay wagons together and that kind of thing.

Now his son Tommy and his wife, Terri-Lynn, operate that. So we’ve got kind of a close connection to agriculture.", "Not only that, but if you talk to the Simcoe county dairy producers or the Simcoe County Federation of Agriculture, they kind of remind you if you’re doing something wrong here. The Simcoe county boys have a very large voice, and they tend to get out and make a lot of comments about things that are going wrong here at Queen’s Park.", "When Mr. Barrett, the member for Haldimand–Norfolk, talked about crazy questions, I couldn’t believe that anybody would not know the difference between hay and straw.

He’s doing a great job and he really enjoys it.", "Also, we’ve got a new councillor up in Oro-Medonte: Scott Jermey. Scott is councillor for ward 5. He runs an operation of about 200 Ayrshires. They milk about 200 Ayrshire cattle on a huge operation in Oro-Medonte. He has done very well, and we are so pleased that he brings this businesslike attitude and perspective to municipal politics in that area, because at times I feel that township is getting a little too bureaucratic. Now I’m so happy that Scott is there. I’ve talked to him a few times, and it’s great to see the fact that some of the municipal councillors are actually running for these positions.", "The farmers in Simcoe county tend to be very, very political. They drive a lot of agendas, and they try to get their concerns across. I can mention a couple of those in a second.", "Bill 40: I have a couple of things I’m concerned about. I know it’s covering livestock now, but it’s going to be really interesting to see how this falls, like if animals die a certain way on the farm. You’d better start looking at what happens with coyotes when they kill livestock right now. That’s a major problem in some areas.", "I had a meeting just the other day with township people in the township of Oro-Medonte and an organization called Big Curve Acres. They feed animals and grow them for things like the Christmas villages, that type of thing. For specific reasons, they’ll grow goats and reindeer and different species.", "These animals are being killed by the coyotes, and it’s almost a non-stop watch on this all the time. The coyotes rip them apart. When the coyotes kill a reindeer or a deer, and they’re doing it all through the woods etc.—and I don’t just specifically refer to the coyotes that kill the wild deer. I’m talking about ones that are killing them on farms that are growing the deer. It’s sad, what happens; they basically eat them alive.", "The reality is that no one seems to be paying attention to this. OMAFRA has got a group involved. MNR—you can talk until you’re blue in the face. Nothing happens. I can tell you, if there’s going to be a real insurance act dealing with livestock, it had better have an impact on people who are growing this type of livestock. I think it’s sad, and I think that the way the government handles coyotes, and the coyote kills, is really bad.", "I know there’s a whole series of people who believe you can’t kill any kind of an animal, and it’s wrong to have any kind of a cull. They’ll come out in droves with different wildlife organizations and that sort of thing. But the reality is that if you’ve ever seen an animal torn apart—a goat or a lamb ripped apart by a coyote—you might have a second thought. And when it starts hitting little Fido and the little dogs in your yards, that’s when you have another thought. And worse still, when something happens to children, that’s going to be a problem.", "I want to put it on the record today for sure. Let’s make sure, if this act has any teeth at all, that in the regulations we specifically deal with animals that are predators on farm animals and on animals that are being raised for agricultural purposes. It’s very, very important that that takes place. Not everyone can raise their animals in a mega barn, like some of the hogs are raised etc. Some of them are actually outside, and those are the ones that are being identified badly. I really want to make sure that’s on the record.", "Another thing, when we talk about insurances—I think most of our municipalities in Ontario have fairly large municipal drains in them. My wife is a council member in the township of Severn, and we’ve got some problems right in that township as well. The drains have not been maintained for 20 or 25 years. There has not been any kind of a program put in place to clean the drains. This is usually done with the permission of the owners; the owners pay part of those costs. But when you leave it that long, major problems develop. First of all, trees and that grow; little shrubs and trees will grow right in the ditches. That causes even worse flooding, and that worse flooding backs up on the farm fields, and some of the fields are soaked until way beyond the time when you can put in the proper crops.", "If there are teeth in the legislation, it also has to have teeth in the things that impact the insurance purposes. Is there someone in Ontario who actually picks up the phone each day or each year and says to the municipality, “How are your municipal drains coming along? Have you got a cleaning program in place?” Those municipal drains were put in there for a purpose, for agricultural purposes, to drain land so people can properly grow crops on land. I’m sure it happens in most municipalities right across our province. I know that there are municipal drain inspectors. I just think it’s a mishmash right now. I think there are just too many unanswered questions. I think if we’re going to really properly have an insurance act, then make sure that things like the municipal drains have some kind of a coordinated effort so that someone is actually keeping an eye on them so they can be properly cleaned.", "The same thing applies to MNR. No one takes responsibility for trees that fall into these rivers. You just can’t go out and remove a tree from the river, because then you’ll kill the fish habitat, that type of thing. In some cases, it’s wildlife as well, with mink and fishers and those sorts of animals. I also think that there’s a responsibility here, and I know it’s a complete new silo, but I think there’s a responsibility with MNR and making sure that if they’re going to actually look after natural resources, when a tree falls down in a river, it’s actually allowed to be cleaned out.

We’re going to see a lot in Ontario in the next two or three weeks when we start getting milder weather. The conservation authorities will all be out there screaming. There’s floods; flooding could happen. In a lot of cases, the flooding is not necessary. When the ice jams up against the trees, then it creates a natural dam, and the natural dam goes back on the waters and floods wetland areas as well. In many cases, it floods the agricultural lands—it’s the same as the municipal drains—to the point where people can’t get on the crops as early as they’d like to. It is a real problem.", "I just think that when you’re talking about having this new legislation—it looks like everybody is onside; it’s wonderful, it’s wonderful, it’s wonderful. Are we actually going to be dealing with these kinds of problems, or is it going to be some kind of a part of the area where no one will really be concerned about it, and we’ll be back here fighting for an amendment a few years from now?", "I also wanted to say one other thing. I don’t have a lot to say on all these things, but I think what’s important is, as an agricultural community, as a province that depends on agriculture, it’s the heart and soul, the backbone of our history. I’m not sure how many people are aware, but we actually had at one time an agricultural party in Ontario, a farming union party. E.C. Drury was the Premier back in the 1920s. There’s a huge picture of Mr. Drury out there. He wrote a book on that. I recommend it to everybody. If you ever have a chance to read the book by E.C. Drury called the Farmer Premier, you’ll see some interesting things he did. For example, he was the Premier who brought in uniforms for the OPP. Who would have thought that? You would have thought that would have been some guy in downtown Toronto, a Bill Blair fan, who would have brought in uniforms for the police officers. But no, it was actually an agricultural Premier who brought that in. There are all kinds of neat things in that book that people should think of.", "It was actually the last time for that particular organization. They thought they could do better than the Liberals, better than the Conservatives, better than the NDP at the time, and they had their own party, and they formed government, I believe, for five or six years at the time.", "Interjection." ],

There were going to be casinos all over the place. Everybody wanted a casino. There was going to be one in Vaughan, one downtown and more in Niagara. Whatever happened to that disaster? You know what? It went with 40,000 jobs in the harness racing industry. That’s what happened to it. Where was the insurance for them? Does anybody know: Did any of those guys get any insurance? I know of nobody. I know of many, many people who were put out of business. As I said earlier, the farmers used to sell literally millions of dollars in crops like hay and straw to that industry. No longer. A lot of those farms now are for sale. They’re cash-cropping it, but those people are no longer working in Ontario. There were going to be all kinds of casinos built that they said would have worked, but that whole thing was a flop, a disaster.

They are on their own. I can tell you of guys who used to have 30 or 40 horses; now they might have one or two, and they’re not worth anything.

That position is one that I think is of the utmost importance when it comes to food security, food sovereignty and the ability for your own region to feed itself, quite literally.", "The Agriculture Insurance Act is enabling legislation. It allows the government to bring other commodities that are currently not covered by business risk management programs or agriculture insurance programs into the fold of the provincial government. Without any type of dollar amount attached to it, it’s simply a good gesture. It’s not necessarily a remedy for what we know is really important: the ability for farmers to have a predictable and bankable support mechanism to continue their operations and be able to buffer those difficult times, whether it be economic conditions or environmental conditions.", "I look forward to hearing from the Minister of Agriculture in terms of how much money he’s willing to attach to these new commodities that will be brought into the fold.

In other words, it’s not unlike your home in that respect. Producers can choose the type and the level of coverage that best meets their needs. For example, in 2013, there were more than 14,000 insurance customers representing five million acres and nearly $3 billion in liabilities that were ensured under the production insurance program. In practical terms, this is available for some 90 commercially grown crops, which would include, but certainly isn’t limited to, such things as grains and oilseeds, tree fruits and grapes, processing vegetables, fresh market vegetables, specialty crops and forage.", "A lot of us will remember, back in decades past, when you would read in the news that various levels of government would pay producers not to grow something or whatever.

Directly, this is driven by the upwards of 15,000 farmers in Ontario who cover more than five million acres of land.", "But there’s more to it. A province that can’t feed itself is a province doomed to fail. Really, this isn’t hard to see. It’s a sad story all over the province of Ontario right now.

This bill we’re debating today will allow for insurance to be offered to more producers in this province. This is an integral step to giving our agriculture sector the backing they need to be able to grow their businesses. With this kind of insurance, we can make sure that our farmers here in Ontario know that if something out of their control occurs, the government will be there to support them.", "Mr. Speaker, we’ve got coverage for things like grain, fruit, vegetables and tobacco, and yet we have no coverage for things like beef and maple products. What has this meant? This has meant that when a freak weather occurrence happens, say, things like flash floods that destroy crops, the farmer has some sort of safety net so they don’t lose their land or, worse, their business. Yet, things like PED in pork or BSE in beef, or when flash floods kill livestock—there’s no insurance available. So if you happened to go into fruit farming, good for you, you’re safe, but if you inherited a farm where your main product is beef, that’s too bad. Just thinking about that is enough to make your head spin. These are jobs and job creators, and they should be treated with respect.", "This isn’t a new problem either. The Ontario Federation of Agriculture has been calling for this expansion of insurance since the early 2000s. Ontario lags behind other provinces in protecting these categories. This is a problem that has been brought up time and time again. Now more than ever, this sort of insurance is necessary.", "It’s not hard to see why. Climate change—something that I hear a lot from the other side—is greatly affecting our ability to grow crops comfortably across this province.

I hope very soon that this government will properly confront Lyme disease from diagnosis to treatment. That’s just one example of what’s happening.", "In certain cases there’s protection for crops against these same sort of challenges, and yet with our livestock there is no protection. It makes absolutely no sense to give protection to one group of agricultural workers and not another. I’m glad there is an effort to fix this problem. I just sincerely hope it’s acted upon sooner rather than later.", "What they need to address this issue is strong insurance regulation—the kind of regulation that gives farmers the support they need and the confidence to do their work, the confidence to grow their businesses, to hire more workers and to put out more product. Unfortunately, this bill doesn’t quite seem to do that.", "Mr. Speaker, it’s been clearly pointed out that this is an enabling bill.

We were hearing then about how the unpredictable weather was affecting harvests. Grape growers were having their seasons affected by the length of the winters, that were particularly cold. Those who had insurance had the peace of mind to know that one bad year wouldn’t completely ruin them and their businesses, but there are a number of people in this province who don’t have the same peace of mind. As my colleague from Welland noted, some areas lost 50% of their buds last year. Crop insurance is one of the tools these farmers use to survive year after year.", "Local students at Brock University have been working hard to try to fix the problem. Students in their courses have worked with leading researchers in helping to make grape crops sustainable during harsh winters. Before, vineyards might lose their entire ice wine harvest to bad weather. Today, because of our talented and brilliant young minds, they can save their harvests and continue to get our amazing Niagara wines into the LCBO.", "Of course, while we’re on the topic of supporting our local agriculture, we should briefly mention supporting our local grape growers and wineries. This can be done easily, by expanding their shelf space at the LCBO. Instead of economic growth going to places outside of Canada, we can put that money back into businesses right here in the province. They can do this just by giving local wineries more space on the shelves of the LCBO. After all, shouldn’t the province be supporting our local businesses? The point is, it shouldn’t just be up to them to help the agriculture sector. Government needs to play a role as well when things out of the farmers’ hands occur.", "I spoke with a local beekeeper in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They tell me directly that when the winter is this long and this harsh, it affects them too. They can’t feed the bees properly and the bees start to die. One hive can house as many as 50,000 bees in the springtime, and they’re not cheap to replace. We start to hear that in Niagara people lose 10 to 50 hives, the entire bee population, over the course of the winter.", "I still have a few pages left but I’ll finish up.

Part of the reason we can do that is we have the biggest building boom going on right out those windows there, building a tax base, and it is that tax base growth that is so essential, because many small rural communities need infusion of capital. They don’t have the property tax base or the commercial tax base to do that. If we don’t realize the interdependence fiscally of large centres—we wouldn’t have banking in Toronto if we didn’t have mining in the north. We had mining banks. We wouldn’t have a healthy financial sector here if we didn’t have a strong rural Ontario.", "This is the time where the insurance model of transferring wealth within the province is particularly important.

Part of the reason Del Monte left is that we have more wineries down there, and wineries and grape-growing generate a lot more revenue. We have challenges right now.", "Also, if you look at the numbers, and you look at the conversions from forage crops to soy and corn, we have a different profile now of food production, and that’s going to be another important part of looking at food security going forward.

I grew up on a beef cash crop farm, I live on a meat goat and cash crop farm now, the rest of my in-laws are all dairy farmers, and I was really looking forward to this particular field day because it was on a fruit farm, and we were going to visit a market garden. I was really dismayed because the OFA had to cancel this field day because there weren’t enough members interested in participating in that particular initiative.

We’re going to go from 36 dates to 39, but the reality is, if that’s going to be a long-term business that’s going to last for a long time and protect the 1,200 jobs here, we’ve got to get that up to 75 to 80 race dates.

They’ve decimated the horse racing industry, which my colleague from Simcoe North brought up in his remarks—60,000 jobs which were supposed to be an enhancement to an industry.

With more rural members than any other party, the PC caucus knows that at first hand and better than other parties in this House, I think.", "As you know, this bill will allow crop insurance to be expanded to cover livestock. Livestock insurance is long overdue. If passed, this bill will allow farmers who choose to pay insurance premiums to tap into the larger pool of funds to compensate for the loss of their livestock.", "However, this bill is not perfect. This bill does not actually create these programs; instead it allows them to be created by regulation. If this bill passes, it’s important that the minister implement these programs swiftly.", "Not only does the minister control the timing of these programs, but he controls which commodities will be eligible. I would encourage the minister to make sure that he does not pick and choose only a few commodities to be eligible for the programs. If cows are included, but sheep are not, we may see farmers abandon sheep altogether. Not only should the main commodities like sheep, hogs and cows be included in the program; this is an opportunity to extend the program to some lesser-farmed commodities like exotic animals or smaller birds like quails and pheasants.", "I encourage the minister to be open and listen to all commodity groups who may wish to be included. Which groups will be included is just one of the many questions left to be answered.", "Another important question is, what constitutes a death? Will the program cover animals that are killed by coyotes or predators? Will it cover animals that die of natural causes? Will it cover stillbirths or animals that have to be put down because of serious injury? These are important questions which we hope will be answered soon.", "For anyone who has ever been around sheep, they know that sheep, unfortunately, die easily. Sheep have been known to suffocate in the snow or even to eat themselves to death. One farmer in my riding joked: “The easiest part of a sheep’s life is its death.” These are all things that the average member of this House wouldn’t necessarily find out on their own, so it’s very important to make sure we listen to farmers when deciding what commodities will qualify.", "I think that everyone in this chamber can agree; it’s ironic that when one of the Premier’s loyal flock leaves this job, they get a severance, but when a farmer loses a sheep, they get nothing.", "Another question that requires serious attention from the minister concerns the value of each animal. Breeding animals are commonly valued higher than non-breeding animals. We have all heard of prized racing horses used for breeding, but the same goes for cows and hogs.", "I’d like to bring up an example of this very important problem. In my riding of Simcoe–Grey, John and Marie Miller own a very unique dairy farm just outside of Creemore. The Millers’ dairy farm is not just a farm; it’s also a micro-dairy where they produce and sell their own dairy products. The Millers ship their products across the province, and I am happy to have met with them just a few months ago to talk about how they can expand into big box grocery stores.", "What makes the Millers’ farm so unique is their use of Jersey cows, which make up only 4% of dairy cows in Ontario. Jersey cows give their milk products a distinct taste that is difficult to replicate. The Millers are the perfect example of the questions surrounding this bill. In the unfortunate event of the loss of one of the Millers’ unique Jersey cows, would John and Marie be paid more than if they lost a more common Holstein? These are questions which cannot be answered without the input and expertise of the many important agricultural groups across this province. The minister must consult with these groups before making decisions that will affect the livelihood of farmers in both Simcoe–Grey and throughout Ontario.", "Speaking of the province’s agricultural groups, I’d like to talk briefly about some of those groups. I don’t know if my constituents would let me speak about farming without mentioning the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, with which I’ve had a 25-year history of good relations. I’d like to take this time to congratulate the OFA’s Don McCabe on his recent election as president and thank former president Mark Wales for all his work over the years. I’d also like to congratulate my good friend and constituent Keith Currie on his election as the OFA’s vice-president. Keith and I have known each other for many years, and I’m happy to have such a strong advocate for Ontario’s farmers within the borders of my riding.", "When we asked Keith for his thoughts on the bill that we’re debating today, he said, rather bluntly and accurately: “If you have livestock, you have dead stock.” I think it’s important to remember: No matter how good a farmer is at their job, there will always be circumstances outside of their control. Be it natural disasters, wild animals or natural causes, farmers are faced with the difficult challenge of keeping their livestock healthy. They spend countless hours and much money caring for their animals. The government should be there to help them when these unfortunate circumstances occur.", "For years, this province has recognized the economic impact of the unexpected loss of crops, but we have yet to realize the same cost that comes with the loss of livestock. But it’s not just the OFA that should be consulted. The province has many key agricultural groups with thousands of members who have dedicated their lives to farming, be it the Beef Farmers of Ontario, Ontario Pork or the Christian Farmers Federation of Ontario, to name a few. These organizations know their commodity groups better than anyone—yes, even better than the minister—and should be consulted as much as possible.", "I was pleased to meet with many of these groups at the plowing match this year, which was held in my riding, in the beautiful village of Ivy. When the member for Haldimand–Norfolk—our party’s critic for agriculture—Toby Barrett, and I met with these groups, they brought up this very issue. In particular, Ontario Pork was very vocal about the need to create a mortality insurance program for livestock.", "As many of you know, Ontario’s pork industry was hit hard in the last year. The PED virus came to Ontario, including my home area of Simcoe county. The virus has nearly 100% mortality rate for piglets and young hogs. That type of death rate is devastating to a farmer both emotionally and financially, to say the least.", "With that said, I’ll just wind up by saying it’s about time the government step up and be there for our farmers when they need us most. Ontario farmers need us to pass this bill, and they need us to do it quickly. Mr. Speaker, I’m happy to support Bill 40. It’s long overdue. I just want to say to the government, which says that we don’t have a right to speak on this bill, that we’re holding it up—that isn’t true. Farmers need to be heard. On this side of the House, we’re very much in touch with farmers and the rural community.", "I just remind you—because you’ve been saying this on other pieces of legislation and during question period, when we bring up the bribery allegations in the Sudbury by-election—that we need to get to work on other things.

No party can speak for our agricultural base, for our farmers. We all have roots. In fact, the New Democratic Party, coming out of the CCF, came from farmers on the prairies: Tommy Douglas, a Baptist minister from the prairies, spoke for farmers and farmer co-operatives; J.S. Woodsworth, a Methodist minister, came from the farming community, spoke for farmers on the prairies; Agnes Macphail, came up through the farmers party, spoke for farmers in a progressive way—that is the history of Canada. Those are the roots of the CCF-NDP. Those were not only progressive roots, they were radical roots, because they spoke for a community—I don’t even have to segue into the Winnipeg general strike—that had deep needs, that were, in fact, suffering. They were hungry. That is where Medicare came from. It came from rural communities. Those are the communities that birthed it. So to say that farmers are inherently conservative is absolutely wrong. Let’s just put that in the record.", "Second of all, I have to say—and this was brought to my attention—that nowhere in this debate has been mentioned the 120,000 migrant workers who work on farms, so I want to give them a shout-out as well, because those are also a community—a community that are hard-pressed, a community that don’t have the rights they should have. So let’s just put that on the record as well.", "Now, I’ve got seven minutes and 43 seconds left to talk about my two years in Huron–Bruce. So picture me, the first female United Church minister sent to the town of Brucefield-Kippen. They’d never had a woman before as their minister. They had never had anyone with a last name like DiNovo, because all of the names I encountered in Huron–Bruce were—let’s say it—WASP last names.", "One of the first things I did there was introduce taking communion by intinction, as it’s called, which they immediately thought was somehow strangely Roman Catholic—because there are Protestant towns and Catholic towns; we all know this about the rural area around there. So I had some work to do. They also had never welcomed somebody who was an exponent, who was an activist, around LGBTQ issues. They welcomed me there even so.", "When I went, I was a vegetarian.

It was one of many lessons that they offered me.", "You will never find a better community than the community of Huron–Bruce and Brucefield-Kippen—phenomenal people. But the only thing we had in common when I got there was English. We spoke the same language. For an urbanite like myself who grew up in the city of Toronto downtown, lived in New York, lived in the Beach, lived in the west end, lived in the Annex, but had never experienced rural life, it was a real eye-opener. I think it’s important to talk about that, because that was my agricultural literacy education.", "What did they teach me? Well, a couple of serious lessons, and I think they’re incredibly important ethical agricultural lessons.", "One of the things they taught me out there was about money: the value of money and not the value of money. They worked so hard. Farmers work so hard, especially—animal farmers work all year round. My cash crop farmers worked, of course, putting in the harvest, taking out the harvest. Everybody worked really hard all year long.", "They sat on these vast tracts of land—because quite frankly, Speaker, you need vast tracts of land now to make a living in agriculture in Ontario. So I said to them, “You know, a downtowner like me would sell off their acreage, buy a BMW, head down to Florida and sit on the beach for the next 20 years,” because they had that much money in equity. I remember in my Bible study class, there was a group of women who were in their eighties—beautiful, wonderful women.

That’s the bill, Bill 40.", "But the real agricultural insurance are the people who work the land. That’s who I’m talking about. I’m talking about that group of 80-something women who said that their real purpose in life was to actually keep that land going, to keep producing food for the next generation and to keep producing jobs for their family and their family’s family. They had been on the land for three or four or five generations already. That’s who I’m talking about. That’s the real insurance that keeps our agriculture going. Those were the women who taught me something about the value of money versus the value of land and the value of hard work. That’s number one.", "Number two, they taught me about relationship, the other insurance that goes into the agricultural community. Quite frankly, while I was there as a minister, just like everywhere else in the world, there were difficulties in families. Some of those families didn’t have marriages that worked out, and as a pastor you’re used to that. You deal with that, right? But what was really interesting to me was that in the city, when two people get a divorce or separate, they’re gone. They do not come back to the same church every Sunday. They do not take part in the same events all the time. They distance themselves, whereas in rural Ontario, in Brucefield-Kippen, people who had gone through that kept coming back to the same church, kept attending the same events. It was amazing.", "I asked them, “Why? Why do you do this?” They said, “Because we have to live together for the next three or four generations. We may not keep our marriage together, but we must maintain community and friendship.” That was a phenomenal lesson in agriculture and the difference between rural and urban. I was impressed, and I saw that as real agricultural insurance. It’s that bond of community, it’s that bond between people, that even if you get separated, even if you have your differences, you’ve got to work together, you’ve got to live together and ride it out. You’ve got to make things work. That’s agricultural insurance.", "What else did I learn? I learned this, Mr. Speaker; I learned it very quickly—I’ve only got a minute left. There was a bird that got into my bedroom in the manse next to the church, and I didn’t know what to do. I opened the window and the bird didn’t go out, so I called my farmer neighbour and I said, “What do I do?” He came over with a tennis racquet and he went “Whack!” The bird was dead; that was it.", "As a city-dweller, I felt a little guilty." ],

The second thing I’ll say is that if this agriculture insurance bill actually wants to have some teeth, it actually has to do what it says it will do, because Ontario is the only province that does not allow production insurance for a broad range of agricultural products.", "With that, I’ll stop; I’ll sit down.

That crop is industrial wind turbines.", "Speaker, it’s a travesty what’s happening in that area that the member so fondly remembers.

She’d be appalled at the manner in which unwilling communities have been absolutely annihilated with this development.", "This bill, Bill 40, is about crop insurance.

We met with Lyle Hall—big shout-out to Lyle Hall and to all the folks at the Essex County Federation of Agriculture; they do great work. Lyle gave us an article from the Ontario Farmer dated January 20 that says that Ontario is shorting rural municipalities. It references the Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund, which was decreased by $10 million in 2013, $25 million in 2014, with an additional $35 million in 2015, making the cumulative savings over three years $115 million. I don’t think those add up, but it is 35% that will be cut out. That’s a large hit.", "There is a fear that maybe even the business risk management program or the crop insurance program could suffer the same fate. There’s nothing that mitigates against the government reducing the payout under the crop insurance or the agriculture insurance program. Even though they’re going to bring in new commodities, the most important component of this bill and of the bill that you bring forward to enable yourselves to bring them in will be the dollar amount attached. It has to be significant. It has to be substantial.

Windsor, as the members opposite may know, is in Essex county, or the breadbasket of Canada. So I’m well acquainted with the importance of our agricultural producers, as are so many members on this side of the House, of course. They are of the utmost importance to our food security and strong contributors to our economy, so it’s our responsibility to do what we can to protect them and their livelihood. Allowing them to have affordable insurance coverage, which is what this bill will do, for the fruits of their labour goes a long way and is a critical component to ensuring the viability of this sector of our economy.", "Last year, we had an extreme weather event in Burlington. We had a flood. We had 200 millimetres of rain in a matter of five hours. We can just imagine what that would do to devastate some of our agricultural producers, had this been the case. They could lose an entire year’s crop and subsequent income in a matter of hours. A premium-based insurance, where the government shares the cost with producers and helps to spread the risk between both parties, is something important which, over time, will help lower the overall associated costs.", "So it’s not just the producers themselves, though, who are important in this conversation; it’s the tertiary industry. In my riding of Burlington we have food processors and we have packagers, and they’re going to be impacted too—people like the Ippolito Group and EarthFresh Foods, incredibly important job creators, important in our food security conversation. We need to think about them, too.", "I’d like to thank my colleague the Minister of Agriculture for his hard work on this legislation and urge all members of this House to support Bill 40.", "Climate change is another issue which is impacting all of us, and we need to be sure to give our farmers the tools that they need to protect their livelihood and our food security." ],

It’s a wonderful way for urban people to know what agriculture is all about and to actually speak to farmers first-hand.", "To all the co-ops and all the farmers’ markets out there—particularly, of course, my own Sorauren Farmers’ Market and the West End Food Co-op—a shout-out for them.", "I want to particularly, of course, highlight the member from Essex’s comment, because absolutely, if there is not money behind this initiative, then really there is no initiative. In terms of insurance for our farmers, our agricultural producers, yes, they do need money. They need money behind any program that’s going to protect them. That is critical.", "Finally, another name that I didn’t mention—and I think it’s really important for my Roman Catholic friends in the room who talk about liberation theology, again going back to our farmers. Is rural Canada inherently conservative? No, it is not. Liberation theology came out of rural Canada. It came out of a man named Ben Smillie on the prairies, not from Central and South America, as is commonly thought, and Oscar Romero, great as he was. It came out of our own Canadian experience and it came out of our own agricultural experience. That merging of faith and social justice is the very roots of our party and the very roots of our country. I think we have to acknowledge that because I think we’ve gone away from that, both here and south of the border.", "So here’s to the radical and here’s to the social justice farmers, because they’re there.

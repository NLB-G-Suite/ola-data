But before I do that, today is the last day of the Legislature for the year, so I want to take this opportunity to wish you and all the members of this House a very merry Christmas, a happy Hanukkah, and the best of the holiday season. We work very closely together, and I know to the world outside, this may seem like a place where we are always sparring with each other. But I really want people to know that there are long-held friendships and relationships that exist in this Legislature. We are, at the end of the day, colleagues. We are, at the end of the day, fierce champions of our respective communities. We’re here for one sole purpose, and that purpose is to build a better province for all our constituents. It’s an honour to work with every single one of you. It has been an exciting and busy year, and I’m looking forward to next year. And I thank you, Speaker, for your service.", "It has been a very busy year for me, personally, in my capacity as the Attorney General of the province—it is a great honour for me to have that role—and, of course, as the government House leader, and working with so many members in that capacity. Most importantly, Speaker—and coming to this bill, Bill 70—the job that I take most seriously is being the MPP for Ottawa Centre. My community has put their faith and trust in me as their representative for over nine years—I’m in my 10th year of service—and it has been an honour to serve my community.", "From the very first day when I sought the nomination back in 2007 and then was subsequently elected in the 2007, 2011 and 2014 elections, the reason I ran for public office in a downtown community like Ottawa is to make sure that we’re building a vibrant, healthy and sustainable community.", "The purpose for me running, personally, was that I wanted to make sure that downtown Ottawa, my community of Ottawa Centre, remained vibrant—that it is a community where people come to build their lives, young and old; where people come to raise their families; where people who are retired—or, as we call them, empty nesters—move back to downtown so that they can enjoy all the great amenities and the quality of life that downtown has to offer.", "The reason for me running was that I did not want to see the hollowing of the downtown core. I did not want to see people fleeing to the suburban part of the city. They’re great parts of the city to live in, but I wanted to make sure that from a public service perspective, all the right public services were there in my community in downtown Ottawa—in Ottawa Centre. That’s the work that I have remained focused on, be it investments in our health care, investments in our schools or building public transit. Those are the kinds of things that our government has invested in again and again and again.", "My community of Ottawa Centre has been a great beneficiary of it. If you look at the investments going on that this particular legislation speaks to and what our fall economic statement speaks to—for example, new investments in health care—I’ve got great institutions like the Ottawa heart institute and the Civic campus of the Ottawa Hospital. There’s more to talk about there in the great, new 21st-century hospital we’re going to build in downtown Ottawa, in the heart of the community that I represent; the Saint-Vincent, which provides care to people with complex needs; and many other such institutions.", "If you just look at the heart institute right now, there is a $200-million expansion that is taking place at the heart institute to provide world-class cardiac care to not only individuals who live in my community but the entire city of Ottawa and the entire eastern Ontario region.", "Similarly, I’m really proud of the investments that we have made in education and in child care, another big focus of the fall economic statement and this bill. Just in my riding, the investments we have seen in rebuilding, revitalizing and refurbishing schools in the downtown core are enormous. We know that schools in the downtown core tend to be older. Most of the schools in my riding are almost 100 years old now. A lot of them were built a while ago. They need TLC—tender, loving care—to make sure our children continue to receive a good education.", "We have seen, for example, a brand new Broadview Public School built in Westboro in my riding. It has just brightened the whole community. You see the kids going to the school—it is remarkable. Similarly, last year we completed a new extension to Mutchmor Public School in the Glebe. It’s an old school, 100 years old or so, and they built an addition to the school. The architecture flows so well. It’s another great example of revitalizing a school and giving a whole new life to that school community.", "Lastly, I will mention Devonshire, which celebrated 100 years a few years ago and has gone through an incredible refurbishment. The school has been kept the same, but inside it’s just like a new life has been brought to school. In it, by the way, while they were doing the renovation, they found all these hidden gems like hidden fireplaces from 100 years ago, which were just covered up, and all kinds of things.", "So many kids are so excited. Parents are delighted because it’s giving them more reasons to live downtown. They know that they can get a good education and good schools for their children. The seniors who are moving back into the downtown core know that health care is available just down the street. We see that the small businesses in Wellington Village, on Elgin Street, in the Glebe, in Westboro, in Hintonburg, are just thriving. The BIAs tells me that the businesses are growing and they’re excited, with more and more people moving back into the downtown core and making it so vibrant.", "Those are all things that are personally very exciting to me, because it’s exactly why I chose to run: to make sure that our downtown core communities like Ottawa Centre are a vibrant place to live. The investment that we are making in building public transit in Ottawa with the LRT is remarkable. That is absolutely a game changer. We’ve got over 12 kilometres of LRT in phase 1 that is being built right now, with the support of the province to the tune of about $600 million. Most of those 12 kilometres run through the downtown core from my riding, really creating the spine for the system that will—" ],

I will not apologize for that, and I encourage you to do the same thing.", "Speaker, I was talking about the downtown core and I was coming around to this bill talking about the modernization of the land transfer tax, how it’s going to make housing more affordable in my community. So if you pay attention for a second, you will hear. But I shall not apologize for talking about my community.", "Going back to public transit, because it is important and it ties to Bill 70 because it’s a major investment that we are making in communities like mine to make sure that Ottawa Centre is a place to live. With the investment of $600 million in phase 1 of LRT and then, most recently, we announced over a $1-billion investment in phase 2 that will go east, west and further south, covering the rest of the city—in addition, building extensions up to Innes road in Ottawa–Orléans and going to the airport, again, to make sure that Ottawa is a vibrant place to live.", "That, Speaker, leads me to a very important aspect of Bill 70, which is the changes that we are making to the land transfer act, where we are making it easy for first-time homebuyers, making it more affordable for first-time homebuyers to be able to purchase their home. Speaker, we know that one of the biggest investments that we make in our lives is when we buy a property, be it a house or a condominium. That is a huge, huge investment. I remember 10 or 12 years ago, Speaker, when I bought my first home, that I saved money for years and years to be able to do so. By creating a real incentive, by making sure that young families and individuals who don’t own homes—to have an opportunity to buy a home is a very exciting part of this bill.", "The change that we are making through Bill 70 is ensuring that first-time homebuyers get a refund of up to $4,000. We’re doubling that refund from $2,000 to $4,000, which is significant. That change means that the land transfer tax will not be payable on the first $368,000 of the cost of your first home, which is roughly about the average cost of a home.", "Again, coming back to my community of Ottawa Centre, where you’ve got an incredibly hot real estate market, we see that that kind of incentive, where first-time homebuyers will not be paying any land transfer tax up to about $368,000, is a significant boost to my community, where we will see more and more people moving into the community and buying homes. With all the amenities, like the investment in the health care infrastructure we’re making, like the investment in our school infrastructure we’re making, like the investment we’re making in our public transit, Speaker: All those things make it even more exciting for young families, for young people, for young professionals to come and live in the Glebe or Hintonburg or Carlington or Carleton Heights or Westboro or Mechanicsville or Champlain Park. All these great neighbourhoods are going to thrive from it.", "Speaker, I thank you for the time. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to very briefly speak about the amazing things that are happening in my community, Ottawa Centre. It’s a great pride of mine to represent such a vibrant community. I’m very grateful to be part of a government that’s making an investment that is going to help individuals who live in urban communities like mine by making investments in our child care, by making investments in our schools, by making investments in our health care, by making investments in our public transit and, most importantly, making it affordable for people to buy their first home.", "Speaker, I look forward to hearing from other members, and I hope they, too, talk about the great things this are happening in their communities." ],

It just seems to be a pattern with this government—shameful conduct, I would say—that we continue to ram bills through committee and we ignore a very serious concern raised by those affected—in this case, those affected by Bill 70. This is what this government has done to Ontario’s small and independent craft distillers. This is a prime example of how this government operates.", "The Ontario Craft Distillers Association spent more than two years—two years—negotiating towards a graduated tax on spirits sold at their locations. This same tax policy has allowed Ontario’s craft breweries to become some of the most successful in the world. So we did it with craft breweries, and this is what the craft distillers wanted to have.", "This was my approach when my former colleague the member for Niagara West–Glanbrook had tabled his Free My Rye bill, Tim Hudak. I picked it up after he left the House and my friend here, Mr. Oosterhoff, was elected. So I want to talk, Speaker, just very briefly about Free My Rye and what it does and what, actually, the Ontario Craft Distillers Association thought the government was going to put forward.", "Under my bill, the markup on the sale price of spirits a manufacturer produces and sells in a year at a store on site would not exceed 10% for the first 50,000 litres, 20% for 50,000 up to 100,000 litres, and 40% for any part in excess of 100,000 litres, to a maximum of 625,000 litres. So that was the recipe for success that I think small craft distillers were looking for, but instead, out of the blue, this finance minister comes down with Bill 70 and pours those two years’ worth of talks down the drain. For comparison purposes, the rate that’s proposed is a 61.5% flat tax on spirits. It’s 10 times the rate that a winery is charged for on-site sales.", "So needless to say, Speaker, when Bill 70 was tabled, after these two years of negotiations were poured down the drain, they were furious. They explained how this regressive tax that the government is proposing would force some or all of those existing 16 small independent distilleries out of business. But, you know, this finance minister, he wasn’t having anything of it. He and some of his members accused these small distillers of making this all up. He basically said, as the finance minister, that they should just drink up and take the medicine.", "So I wanted to just take this opportunity to applaud Charles Benoit, who is the head of the Ontario Craft Distillers Association, which also includes a brand new distillery in my riding of Leeds–Grenville, the King’s Lock Craft Distillery in Johnstown, Ontario. They made an incredibly strong case for taking this distillery tax out of Bill 70 and restarting negotiations on a graduated tax. It would have allowed our craft distillers producing world-class grain-to-glass spirits to experience the same growth we’ve seen in our craft brewing, in our winery and in our cidery sectors.", "I know the Minister of Children and Youth Services wants me to give a shout-out to Bruce Davis and the Gananoque Brewing Co., so I’ll do that, sir. I’ll do that just for you, sir.", "But that makes my point. The policies that this government put in place to grow the craft beer industry, to grow small wineries across the province, ones that all members celebrate—we’re not taking the same approach when it comes to those small craft distilleries.", "We had a great opportunity, from an economic development standpoint, to grow this industry. Other provinces do it. The model that has been talked about in this House on numerous occasions was the British Columbia model, which allowed their small distillers to grow and flourish.", "Charles Benoit talked about his disappointment in a press conference we held here at Queen’s Park together on Tuesday. As Charles stated, “Our association first met with the ministry in August, 2013. For three years, we were led to believe that the government heard us on the importance of a graduated tax. Bill 70 proves otherwise, and guarantees that Ontario misses out on the craft distilling renaissance happening throughout the rest of North America.”", "So we tabled an amendment, Speaker. The government used their majority, as they do to vote down any good idea that’s at the House. We wanted to allow distillers to sell up to 1,250 litres of spirits tax-free in the store that they own and operate. We thought that was a reasonable compromise. Again, the guillotine of this government came down, cut down any reasonable amendments, stopped debate. Using the words that the member for St. Catharines said many, many times when he was in opposition, the government “choked off” debate and time-allocated this bill.", "Again, with craft distilleries, we’re missing a great opportunity, Speaker. I wanted to pitch this to them again. Please, I want some indication from this government that you’re recognizing what we are doing to this industry. Why can’t we sit down and talk about a graduated tax? They stood at the table in good faith. They thought they were bargaining in good faith with this government. Again, this government led them down the garden path and poured all of those wonderful talks down the drain with Bill 70. It’s a terrible deal for distillers, the schedule is awful, and I wanted to make sure that I stood up for those people today.", "Thanks for giving me that opportunity, Speaker." ],

We have never seen a piece of legislation move so quickly. It was rushed for a number of reasons, I believe.", "The 5,000 people who appeared on the front lawn of Queen’s Park in protest specifically to schedules 16 and 17 contained in Bill 70—Bill 70, of course, is called Building Ontario Up for Everyone. The government remembered the “for everyone” part after they prorogued, so we’re happy about that. If we’re in the Christmas spirit and we’re trying to be generous, I’m really happy that the government remembered the “for everyone” part of this bill.", "However, Madam Speaker, the schedules speak a different story, schedule 1 in particular, with regard to the new tax on craft distillers.", "If you had asked me if I would be talking in defence of the 16 craft distillers almost on a consistent basis for the last two weeks, two weeks ago I would have said, “I don’t think so.” Because we were also led to believe that the government had been working collaboratively—you know, this new culture of openness and transparency. Their fourth pillar of the government is to build up the economy and build businesses up.", "But schedule 1 does exactly the opposite of this, Madam Speaker. Because we have these boutique wine and beer now in grocery stores, the government has increased the tax for those operators, because they no longer have a stand-alone operation. That was made clear during our review at finance. But what it does, actually, for craft distillers is quite the opposite.", "We’ll hear the bafflegab, if you will, from the government side of the House on this, but I want to make it very clear: We believe the craft distillers on this one. In fact, Charles Benoit of the Ontario Craft Distillers has actually opened their books, and they have told us the true financial impact of a tax of 61.5% of the retail price, plus a 28-cent to 38-cent per-litre volume tax and an 8.93-cent environment tax for each non-refillable container. He has been very clear about the impact that this change will have on their business. When he did come to Queen’s Park and he participated in the press conference, he said that on a good day, this will probably save them $1.80 per bottle.", "That is the change that the government has made. That’s the extent of the investment that this government is willing to put forward to craft distillers, who are local entrepreneurs, who take some pride in their craft, who have very strong partnerships with their local farmers and the agricultural sector and who are committed to their local communities and to supporting those local food movements, local agriculture movements, and took this government at face value for three years.", "I have to correct my record. I thought it was two years, but actually when we review back the entire process, the Ed Clark process that the Premier has embraced, it’s almost a three-year investment of time, energy and time away from their business. They also had to sign a non-disclosure statement with the Premier’s advisory council to not speak to their MPPs. It must be a breach of some privilege somewhere to have a citizen in the province of Ontario and prohibit them from speaking to their duly elected MPPs. For us it was quite alarming and definitely a red flag, a red Liberal flag.", "So what do we have here in the province of Ontario now? We have 16 craft distillers who are incredibly disappointed in this government, 16 small businesses who are not going to give up, and neither are we. We did try to make Bill 70 a better bill for them at committee by bringing forward an amendment to have them exempt for the first 5,000 litres—5,000 litres. The government used their majority to vote us down. We supported the PC amendment of 1,250 litres, a tax exemption.", "This is the idea of graduated taxation, to give these businesses an opportunity to be successful. But the government is willing to let those same craft distillers give away 1,250 litres of promotional—this is something that the finance minister likes to brag about—but they will not let them sell that product tax-free. Well, how generous of the Liberal government to let them give away their product, but will not let them sell it and be tax-free.", "That is the walking contradiction of this government, who says they believe in small businesses; that they believe and understand that the small and medium-sized businesses in the province of Ontario are the true job creators. Yet, when they had an opportunity to engage an emerging field, an emerging sector, they decided to not apply the graduated tax model, which has been so successful in the province of Ontario.", "The craft beer industry in Ontario has proven to be very successful, as has the local wine movement as well. The BC model allows for a 50,000-litre exemption. That’s how that government is demonstrating to an emerging craft movement, from a distiller’s perspective—that’s how they are supporting those businesses. It has proven to be so successful. The grain farmers in BC and the fruit producers in BC have an amazing collaborative relationship with those distillers, because we grow good things in Ontario and we want to put those products into a place where they can create jobs, they can improve communities and where people who are invested in becoming a craft distiller can realize their dreams.", "I think it was genuinely a surprise. I think that the government thought that they were doing the craft distillers a huge favour by giving them a small break at the LCBO level, but the movement is in the distilleries. I toured one in Ayr, Ontario, last Friday. I was so impressed with these young entrepreneurs. They were so committed to quality, so committed and so proud of the fact that they’re following their dream. They were out in Ayr on a farm. They had totally refurbished this barn. They use the mash after they make the vodka or the rye—they’re still deciding what they’re going to be making—and they can actually put it on the field. It’s full circle. Environmentally friendly geothermal solar panels—they are so far ahead of this government it was a little bit embarrassing for me to be there because the Liberal government is actively working against these young bright people of the province of Ontario who want to be part of this growing economy, who want to be part of the solution.", "What does this government do? They rush Bill 70 through this House in the last two and a half weeks. The reason I mention the speed of the bill is because I will say, in this House, that democracy was undermined by this process. The legislative process where a bill would move through this place with due democratic participation—this government failed on this mark. The reason that they did fail is that they time-allocated the debate. I had one hour. I think only two of our members got to speak to this bill at second reading.", "We tried to pull schedules 16 and 17 from this bill because this is a finance bill that has nothing to do with downtown Ottawa." ],

Undermining worker safety in the province of Ontario and hurting small and medium-sized businesses in the province of Ontario—right now Bill 70 is a perfect example. It is a perfect vehicle for how our government is so disconnected with the people of this province.", "I quoted that 2,000 skilled trade workers were on the front lawn; legislative security did let me know that it was closer to 5,000. They weren’t here because they felt that the process was so consultative. They weren’t here because they’re so supportive of this government. They weren’t here because they feel so supported by this government. They were here fighting for good jobs and fighting for worker safety. That’s what they were here for. They had to come to the front lawn because they were not consulted in the crafting of this legislation.", "The government will say that there were two substantive reports that came forward which informed schedules 16 and 17, and I will contend, as I did in the two hours that we had for clause-by-clause—in the two hours that we had for clause-by-clause—that in those reports, the Dean report included, one of the number one recommendations is that if you are changing legislation as it relates to worker safety and the Labour Relations Act, then you must have the employer and the employees at the table while you do so. That is how you craft progressive, meaningful legislation. You don’t do it after the fact, and this government tried to do it after the fact.", "The reason I have evidence that this government just rushed this piece of legislation through is that they had to amend their own legislation: Ten amendments at committee—10 amendments on schedule 17 really just sort of tinkering around the edges, nothing really substantive. There’s also a get-out-of-jail-free clause at the end saying that the minister can pretty much override.", "It’s hard. It’s hard right now on this last day of this Legislature because some of us are tired—full disclosure—as we leave this place and as we have tried to work with this government in a collaborative effort. We brought amendments to Bill 70 which were informed by the voices of the people that we represent because that’s the way it’s supposed to work. We’re not here for ourselves; we are here for the people who elected us. It’s a huge responsibility.", "As I mentioned in committee on worker safety, I will always bring up one person’s name in my riding because, for me, worker safety is incredibly personal. It’s incredibly personal because we have children who are entering the skilled trades. My own son is starting his apprenticeship to be an electrician. I’m incredibly proud of him. But when you undermine a process that is meant to keep workers safe and meant to hold employers to account for their practices and their policies as employers, you need to ensure that workplace inspections are a part of that equation.", "When I was first elected in Kitchener–Waterloo, there was a young man named Nick Lalonde, 23 years old, who was working on the 11th storey of a building—Waterloo is definitely growing up—and he fell to his death. He had a child, and he had a family that loved him. But what he didn’t have was working-at-heights training. There was no workplace health and safety policy in place, and the ministry had not been monitoring this particular contractor to ensure that those practices that the government talks about were actually in place.", "I drive by that building every single day and I think of this young man. I think of the lost potential of workers who lose their lives when they go to work in the province of Ontario. I have to tell you that this province can do a much better job on that.", "If we thought schedules 16 and 17 would improve worker safety in the province of Ontario, then we would be supportive of them. But unfortunately, schedule 16 amends the Occupational Health and Safety Act to allow the Chief Prevention Officer to accredit a health and safety management system according to the standards set out by the CPO. This gives the Chief Prevention Officer of the province of Ontario the ability, or the powers, to recognize an employer if they are a certified user of an accredited health and safety management system that meets some of the standards set by the CPO.", "When we met with finance staff—and I have to tell you that the public servants who serve this Legislature are very amazing people, and I think they care deeply about their work. But when we had asked them about the consultation that they did on the schedule, they made it very clear that they consulted within their own department, with their own client. Again, that speaks to a flawed process, and that’s why you have a piece of legislation that New Democrats cannot support, Madam Chair.", "It was also very concerning that the ministry, on the same day, put out a memo saying that this legislation will reduce the burden of workplace inspections—the burden. What we know in the province of Ontario, and actually in other jurisdictions, is that these health and safety management systems are not the be-all and end-all that the government would like them to be. There are weaknesses in this model, for sure, and the evidence speaks to that. But when the government or the ministry considers—this memo came from the Ministry of Labour—that the burden of a workplace inspection—just even that language is disconcerting for us, because there’s a direct correlation between workplace safety and the accountability that employers are held to, and the level of those inspections on a workplace site.", "When you hold the employer to account for having safety as a priority in the workplace, then workers are safer. When workers are trained appropriately and go through an apprenticeship program which actually is very meaningful and based on quality, when they are trained in that manner, they are safer. Workplaces are safer. When they are not, this compromises the safety of the entire workplace, or a work site in this instance. So that is a challenge.", "Bill 70 is really a disparate level of schedules that have come together, but schedule 1, schedule 16 and schedule 17 definitely are sort of buried in there. For us, they are incredibly concerning.", "I didn’t even have a chance to deliver petitions on Bill 70. That’s how fast Bill 70 went through. I do have some, from skilled tradespeople across the province who are incredibly concerned about the way that this legislation moved forward. Who was driving this legislation, I think, is of concern as well.", "This is from Melissa Mcglashan. She says that Bill 70 will allow labourers to perform skilled tasks that presently require a licensed tradesperson. That’s the heart of the concern. She goes on to say that this is another example of governments regulating only in the interests of investors, rather than the workers of this province.", "I have so many of these testimonials from the people who are building Ontario up. This is what this government needs to understand. You will not build Ontario up without trained, qualified, competent, skilled trades workers. You will not.", "We have, really, so many issues with Bill 70. The people who came to committee—we voted on Bill 70 at noon and we took delegations at 1 o’clock. This has never happened. The list of delegations was handwritten by the Clerk—never happened. One person who came— Charles Benoit from the Ontario craft distillers—I asked him, “How much time did you have to appear before committee?” He said, “Seventy-eight minutes.”", "When you undermine the democratic process—this is a shared responsibility that we all have, to ensure that legislation serves the people, not special interests; to ensure that people are brought into this place. This is the people’s House. We are here for the people of Ontario. When a government so actively works against that principled approach to this democratic institution, it leaves us all with questions about the purpose and the goals and the intention of a government, because what Bill 70 does not do is build Ontario up for everyone. In fact, it leaves a huge swath of our population out of the equation.", "This is my last appeal: that the finance minister would consider pulling schedule 16 and 17 from Bill 70 and give the Ontario craft distillers a graduated tax scheme so they can actually survive in the province of Ontario." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m very proud to be standing in this House today for the third reading of Bill 70, the Building Ontario Up for Everyone Act (Budget Measures), 2016. The fall bill reflects the choices our government has made to help people in their everyday lives, creating jobs and growing the economy, all the while remaining committed to balancing the budget next year and remaining balanced the year after. Bill 70 is part of our plan to build Ontario up for everyone. We’re making housing more affordable, we’re strengthening consumer protection and we’re supporting growth across the province.", "Our plan is working. Over the past two years, our economy has grown 5.3%. Last year, our economic growth was double the national average. In fact, for the first half of this year, Ontario’s growth was faster than Canada, the US and almost all other G7 countries. In fact, the commerce board of Canada today has just announced that Ontario is at lead with BC for that growth.", "Since the 2008 global recession, 660,000 net new jobs have been created in Ontario. The majority of these jobs are full-time in the private sector and at above-average wages. These are good jobs—jobs that Ontarians can rely on. In fact, Ontario’s unemployment rate today is at an eight-year low. As I reaffirmed in the 2016 Ontario Economic Outlook and Fiscal Review, we will continue to make strategic choices to grow our economy, to attract more jobs, to encourage businesses to grow and scale up and to make life easier for everyone across the province.", "We often hear from people that they’re concerned about not being able to afford their first home. It’s difficult for many to get up on that first rung of the property ladder. Bill 70 proposes that as of January 1, 2017, the maximum refund of land transfer tax, the LTT, is doubled for eligible first-time homebuyers to $4,000. With the increased maximum, no LTT would actually be payable by those qualifying purchasers on the first $368,000 of the cost of their first home. In fact, with the doubled refund, more than half of first-time homebuyers in Ontario would pay no LTT on the purchase of their first home.", "While we’re supporting first-time homebuyers, we’re also protecting renters. The government is taking action by freezing the property tax on apartment buildings while reviewing how the high property tax burden on these buildings affects rental market affordability. The average municipal property tax burden on apartment buildings is more than double that for other residential properties, such as condominiums.", "Increases in rents and home prices have made housing affordability a concern for a growing number of people trying to enter the market.", "At the same time, we’re also modernizing the LTT, given that rates have not changed since 1989. In fact, the residential properties that we’re speaking of would see a marginal increase by 0.5% on the portion of the purchase above $2 million, and the rate on commercial, industrial and agricultural properties would also go up to 2% from 1.5% on the portion of those purchases above $400,000. This would help fund the enhancements to the first-time homebuyers refund.", "We’re also doing our part to strengthen consumer protection. We propose to extend Ontario Securities Commission whistleblower protections to employees who provide information about the possible contraventions of Ontario commodity futures law.", "We would also establish the initial parameters for the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario, otherwise known as FSRA. This would be a new, independent and flexible regulator of financial services and pensions. The establishment of FSRA represents an important first step towards modernizing and strengthening the regulation of financial services and pensions in Ontario.", "FSRA would be more consumer-focused and improve protections for investors and pension plan beneficiaries. We’re also amending the Pension Benefits Act to clarify the entitlements to portability of pension benefits and give the Superintendent of Financial Services within FSCO the authority to impose the appropriate measures in the pensions sector to improve enforcement of the Pension Benefits Act.", "This bill is also includes amendments designed to support economic growth across the province. As the opposition has highlighted, Bill 70 does include changes that would amend the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation and Public Protection Act of 1996. In less than five years, the number of distillers in our communities has grown more than tenfold. There is strong evidence that there is a bright and promising future for craft spirits here in Ontario. We want distillers to attract new customers, grow their businesses and thrive in their communities. As it stands right now, revenue for those distillers, say, from a $39 bottle of the spirits sold at their on-site store is only 39%. With our changes, the distillers would have an increase in their revenue to about 45%. We’ve also included tax exemptions for promotional distribution of up to 1,250 litres of spirits. Both of these changes would bring distillers closer in line with the way breweries and wineries operate with regard to on-site sales and promotional allowances. These proposed changes are designed to improve the bottom line of small distillers and help them invest, hire, grow and thrive in their communities.", "We’re supporting small business. We know that’s important for all of us.", "The building up our Ontario plan also supports the implementation of our fiscal plan. We are balancing the books this year and next. We’re borrowing less than we’ve ever had in the past. Our interest on debt as a percentage of revenue in this province is now the lowest in 25 years. We’re taking advantage of ensuring that we stimulate growth by investing in things that matter to the people of Ontario without sacrificing those programs and services that matter to them. We’ll continue to do our part to ensure Ontario grows and that our economy grows. We’re taking steps to improve the College of Trades, as also mentioned by the members opposite, recognizing that everyone needs to be at their best. Taking advantage and recommendations from Tony Dean and, since then, Chris Bentley, we’re enacting those measures to provide greater protections for consumers, the public, as well as workers." ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, I rise to speak on this Bill 70—one of the few times anybody in this Legislature actually gets to speak on this bill. It was rushed from beginning to end. It fell out of—well, it was supposed to fall out of the fall economic statement, which was only, by the way, the middle of November. And here we are, in the first week of December, and the bill is about to pass today, if the government has their way. It’s a matter of hours, Speaker, that we’ve had across the entire province to talk about this bill, not days or weeks. It could be calculated in minutes, to be quite frank.", "Instead of the fall economic statement, where we should be talking about the dire financial straits that the province is in thanks to the government, we should be talking about the massive debt, our deficit. The Financial Accountability Officer tells us we are going to have 13 consecutive years of deficits in the province of Ontario. That’s staggering, that we can be the largest subnational debtor on the planet and still be accumulating deficits.", "Now, I know the government says they’re going to balance by 2017-18, but I have to tell you, the Financial Accountability Officer came out with not one, not two, but three documents in about a three-week period that say, “No, that’s not what’s going to happen.” He came out with his outlook, his medium-range outlook, and said, “They’re not going to balance by 2017-18. In fact, they’re going to have a $2.6-billion deficit at that time”—$5.2 billion this year, a $2.6-billion deficit on the year that the government says they’re going to balance, and increasing to $3.7 billion. According to our independent Financial Accountability Officer, our deficit is scheduled to continue to rise, not reduce, Speaker.", "But we don’t find any of that here in this bill. What we do find instead is tinkering with the Municipal Act. In the fall economic statement bill—Bill 70—we’ve got the Municipal Act, which is, first of all, unusual in itself, that we’re dealing with the Municipal Act in a finance bill. But what’s even more unusual is that—this is Bill 70—we’re also dealing with Bill 68 simultaneously, and Bill 68 is all about the Municipal Act. It deals entirely with the changes to the Municipal Act.", "It just tells us that this government is scrambling to make some semblance that they’re in control and in charge, but oops, they’re not. They’ve got a chunk of the Municipal Act that we’re dealing with in Bill 70 that didn’t make it into Bill 68. With this speed come mistakes.", "Speaker, here we are, one day earlier at 11:45 in the morning, we have a vote. The vote passes to send us to our finance committee, which, incidentally, is meeting this very second downstairs on yet another issue. To have the same finance people that—the third party’s finance critic and me having to be here, when we’re supposed to be downstairs also, just tells you they’re fumbling and bumbling over trying to ram all these things through at the same time with the same people. It should never happen. We’ve got rules to make that not happen, Speaker, but the rules are all thrown out this week and last week as we fumble and bumble through these bills.", "So at 11:45 in the morning, the bill passes. You have until 1 o’clock to book a deputation with our committee, which is also seized with wiping everything else we’ve done out and go and meet with these deputants. But we already had other pre-budget consultations scheduled for that day. It’s amazing, Speaker, that we’re meeting on this with this speed. Here are these people at 11:45 in the morning. They get notice: 1 o’clock; book it.", "As the third party finance critic mentioned, the agenda was handwritten. I’ve never seen that either. That’s quite amazing. A scribbled-out, handwritten agenda in a legislative committee that’s meeting was quite novel to see, I must say. It was a keeper, Speaker. Now we’ve got people who came to present as best they could, considering they had an hour’s notice.", "Again, they’re rushing this through. It was so bad that the government brought 10 amendments to their own bill—mistakes they made along the way, and things they needed to fix. It’s that rushed. It’s this rush that is probably the most upsetting.", "I know that other members here wanted to speak on these 27 acts. They’re amending 27 different laws. Again, many of them have nothing to do with finance. They’re rammed in here. They’re creating four new laws.", "In fact, the most interesting part—you heard the Premier say only three weeks ago, when this bill was introduced, Bill 70, that there are no new taxes. No new taxes. But as you start to read through this, as you heard my colleague from Leeds–Grenville and the third party finance critic mention, there’s a 61.5% increase in sales tax on Ontario’s craft spirits distillers, who came to the committee and told us that if and when this bill passes, they will cease operation. They will close their businesses down. They were promised things by the government, who, in their opinion, led them along. They stuck it out as long as they could, waiting for this big change to come. The change that came, sadly, is going to put them out of business. They told the committee. Those are their words. They are going to close their businesses. That in itself is disappointing. It’s very sad news for employees throughout Ontario in the craft distiller business. It defies what the Premier said. She said “no new taxes,” and this is a 61.5% sales tax increase.", "That slouches in comparison to the $105 million in new taxes that are being imposed on Ontario’s families and seniors in this bill—$105 million in new taxes. The Premier said “no new taxes,” but her bill that I presume she’s going to vote for in a couple of hours from now will be in favour of a $105-million tax increase.", "There used to be a 1.5% tax rate on houses over $250,000, but now it’s going to be 2% on the amount of the value of the properties that exceed $400,000. That scoops up a big chunk of money for this government.", "So while the Premier says “no new taxes,” we’ve got the distillers charged taxes, and we’ve got $105 million in taxes on families and seniors on the sale of their homes.", "We brought some amendments. I mentioned that the government themselves brought 10 amendments to clean up the mess that they scrambled together in this bill that they put together quickly. We’ve asked them to remove that $105-million tax that’s being added. They said no. They voted down our amendment. The Liberal government voted down our amendment that would save families $105 million starting January 1. That’s gone. Get ready to write the cheques. More money for this government. To think about their waste, their mismanagement, and their scandals—they’ve got another $105 million thrown in the pot starting January 1 to add to that mess.", "We asked them to remove amendments, Madam Speaker. We asked them to remove the amendments where the minister is allowed to collect and use certain information. We asked them, and this is on land transfer again: “What are you going to do with that?” We asked them that in our briefing, and they couldn’t tell us what they’re going to do with this information. But they want it. You would think that they would know in advance, or at least be able to tell us in advance, what they’re going to do with that if it was something that was important to the people of Ontario. But that’s gone.", "When we go to the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation and Public Protection Act—this is the one that my colleague from Leeds–Grenville has championed so well; Steve Clark has championed this unbelievably well, fighting for the craft distillers. We brought an amendment and, sadly, again, it got turned down by this government. It would have altered this 1,250-litre tax-free exemption to be applied to spirits that are sold, instead of those distributed free of charge.", "The government will boast, “Oh, we’re going to allow them to distribute these free of charge.” The amount that they’re talking about for other distillers would be literally something they’d spill in a month. This is more than some of these craft distillers even make in a year. So their competitors will be able to dole that much out as samples, without charge, where these guys will be put out of business because of that. We brought an amendment, a very thoughtful amendment. It got turned down by the Liberal government. It’s gone, as will those companies be gone in a month from now, Speaker. That’s the saddest part of this.", "We’ve asked for sections that impose a phased increase to the basic tax rate on wine and wine coolers purchased from boutiques and wine stores. That got thrown out. Everything we brought—all the productive and thoughtful ideas that we could garner from those quick deputations that we had from the people and the companies and the associations that had great ideas, we put into thoughtful amendments—gone. They didn’t want to hear anything, Speaker. Bang the gavel, get us out of the way, ram this thing through as fast as possible. I’ve just never seen anything like that. From the time a bill is written to the time it’s passed, it goes through like that.", "It has nothing to do, in many cases, with finance. We don’t talk about finance. We don’t talk about our debt and our deficit. We don’t talk about the dire financial straits. No, we’re going to fix something in the Municipal Act in this bill. We’re going to fix things that have nothing to do with the finances of Ontario, and it’s all because they’re ramming and cramming." ],

This atrocity is often referred to as the Rape of Nanking and is one of the most horrific atrocities in modern history. More than 200,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians were indiscriminately slaughtered under the command of General Iwane Matsui.", "In John Pritchard and Sonia Zaide’s book, The Tokyo War Crimes Trial, they wrote about the slaughter. Tens of thousands of women, both young and old, were sexually assaulted in the Japanese capture of the city. Men and women, survivors and veterans, Chinese and Japanese alike, recount stories of women being dragged from hiding places and gang raped, with noncompliant women being beaten or killed. This earlier form of sexual slavery and human trafficking is noted in various history books.", "Those who survived this horrific atrocity continue to suffer physically and psychologically in the reliving of those memories. They understood the need to record this history, but the numbers of survivors are dwindling and their stories are in danger of being forgotten and lost forever.", "Ontario, Mr. Speaker, is the home to one of the largest Asian populations in Canada, with over 2.6 million recorded in 2011. The Asian community has contributed greatly to our province by enriching our cultural diversity socially, politically and economically through arts, work ethics and wisdoms. Almost every Asian who has emigrated to Canada over the past 40 years would have been affected by the events in Asia during the Second World War to some degree. Some Ontarians even have direct relationships with the victims and survivors of the Nanjing Massacre, yet many are unaware of the atrocities that occurred in Asia during the Second World War.", "An official commemorative day of remembrance for the Nanjing Massacre offers not only an occasion to educate Ontarians about this event but also other atrocities that occurred in Asian countries during the Second World War. Ontario is recognized as a leader in an inclusive society, but inclusiveness is not possible without providing Ontarians the chance to reflect on this part of history. Increasing awareness of this event through education and commemorative events will open doors for greater discussion and deeper understanding of the causes, to ensure history does not repeat itself.", "Erna Paris, an award-winning journalist and human rights activist, stated that “an Ontario calendar day to commemorate the Nanjing Massacre will bring well-deserved attention to this poorly known historical event and in doing so, serve the interests of all Ontarians.”", "At this point, I want to encourage all my colleagues to look in the east gallery, to the founder of ALPHA Education, Dr. Joseph Wong. Dr. Wong has been known as a fighter for social justice since 1979. Inspired by the relentless effort of the Jewish community in revealing and remembering the horror of the Jewish Holocaust, and appalled by the absence of information and knowledge about the Asia-Pacific War, he founded Toronto ALPHA in 1997 with the mandate to seek justice for the victims and to foster humanity education.", "Through ALPHA Education, hundreds of students in the Toronto District School Board, Toronto Catholic District School Board and York Region District School Board are given an opportunity to learn about the Nanjing Massacre. Furthermore, ALPHA Education provides resources and support to teachers in these three school boards.", "Recently, I had an opportunity to meet with a group of students in grade 12 at Bayview Secondary School, who told me that the school and society in general do not focus on the Second World War in the East. The students’ view of the Second World War has been largely presented through a Western lens, and Asian atrocities are, largely, rarely discussed or mentioned in regular history classes.", "Former president of the ALPHA chapter at U of T, St. George campus, Alissa Wang, informed me that “our education system, to this day, presents only one side of a much more complex and multidimensional history.” Alissa stated, “to commemorate the Nanjing Massacre not only because it is a symbolic event in Asia’s Second World War history, but also because it is a crime against humanity and thus a critical event in world history that teaches us important lessons for the present and the future.”", "Right before Christmas 1998, the Ontario Legislature passed MPP Ted Chudleigh’s bill on a Holocaust Memorial Day, Bill 66. This bill received all-party support and is the first bill of its kind in any jurisdiction in North America.

It was the first tri-sponsored bill to pass in the history of Ontario.

Why am I supporting this bill and why is it so significant to remember this tragic event in human history? Most people remember Hitler’s Nazi Holocaust committed against the Jewish people, and people know that Japan started World War II, but they do not remember the specifics of the atrocities committed against the Asian people by the Japanese Imperial Army. World War II has affected me personally as well.", "The Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking, was a mass-murder killing of Nanjing civilians and unarmed soldiers that happened in late 1937 to early 1938. This event occurred after the Japanese army invaded Nanjing, which was China’s capital at the time.", "Reports document that the Japanese Imperial Army ruthlessly massacred about 300,000 Chinese, most of them being civilians, many women and children, and also raped more than 20,000 Chinese women and girls, ranging in age from younger than 10 to older than 80. Thousands and thousands of Chinese were slaughtered using all kinds of gruesome killing methods. It was one of the most massive and inhumane massacres in the history of mankind, Mr. Speaker.", "Japanese nationalists contend that the death tolls are inflated and the majority killed were resisting Japanese occupation. To this day, pages in Japanese school history textbooks deny the fact that this massacre actually took place. Because of this, we can still witness the heated protests on the streets in China. Then and now, the Nanjing Massacre remains one of the darkest events of the last century.", "What does the Nanjing massacre mean to the current generation? To the average Canadian, it probably means nothing and is something they probably have never heard of before. To the average Chinese Canadian, it probably also doesn’t mean very much, except that it might be something they have heard from their parents or grandparents. To the Japanese who are under 50 years old, they probably also don’t know much about it.", "For about 60 years, from 1937 to 1997, the overwhelming majority of the people in the world outside of China did not know much about the Nanjing Massacre and most likely had never heard of it before. It was only after Iris Chang, in 1997, published her bestselling book The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II, that more people outside of China heard of the Nanjing Massacre, but it was still a very small minority.", "A few months back, I read the testimony of an 87-year-old Chinese woman called Xia Shuqin. She shared her story of how she survived the Nanjing Massacre:", "“It was Dec. 13, 1937. ‘Around 9 or 10 a.m., the Japanese invaded our house,’ Xia remembered vividly. ‘My father was killed immediately after they broke in. My grandparents, my parents, my sisters, everyone was scared and crying. Seven out of nine of my family members were killed.’....", "“Only Xia and her then four-year-old sister survived. ‘I was stabbed three times and passed out. When I woke up, I found myself covered with blood,’ Xia said with tears in her eyes.", "“Her legs were trembling but she insisted to stand on the stage for the whole speech. ‘I heard my sister crying and looking for our mom. But everyone else had died.’", "“It was not easy for an 87-year-old to travel across the world”—to the US—“but Xia made it in order to preserve her testimony, to let more people know what had happened in Nanjing in 1937.”", "About 15 years ago, I was working very closely with Dr. Joseph Wong—he was here this morning; maybe he’s here this afternoon—the founder of ALPHA Education and the Yee Hong Centre for Geriatric Care, regarding sex slavery, the so-called comfort women, committed by the Japanese imperial military soldiers during World War II.", "One evening, during that time, I saw a movie about the Nanjing Massacre in one of the downtown Toronto theatres. The movie was a story based on Iris Chang’s bestselling book The Rape of Nanking. The movie showed so many ruthless scenes of this massacre, which I do not want to repeat in this House today, Mr. Speaker. I came home late that night, and I couldn’t sleep the whole night.", "Before the Nanjing Massacre took place, Japan invaded Korea on August 10, 1910. The Japanese imperial military occupied the Korean peninsula until August 15, 1945. That is 36 years. During this period, Koreans were not allowed to speak in the Korean language in public places. Korean students were punished at school when they were found speaking in Korean. Koreans were forced to change their names to Japanese names.", "Toward the end of World War II—i.e., from 1942 to the end—the Japanese military apprehended roughly 200,000 Korean women, aged from 10 to over 50. The Japanese imperial soldiers sent these women to the front line in the battlefields and forced them to become sex slaves. Every night, these women were raped by so many soldiers repeatedly. Some women had to “treat” over 30 Japanese soldiers. When some of the women got pregnant, they disappeared, and no one knew what happened to these women.", "It was not just Korean women. Some of the women were kidnapped from the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and China.", "After the end of World War II, many of these so-called comfort women refused to go back to their families because they felt so ashamed.", "Today, many of us were shocked when we learned that Boko Haram kidnapped hundreds of schoolgirls and used them as slaves. That’s exactly what happened during World War II to tens of thousands of Asian women—for sex slavery.", "The people in Japan don’t know about that part of history, because the Japanese government does not want to admit that their country has inflicted such terrible and inexcusable acts toward other human beings. In their history books, this part of history is completely whitewashed—unbelievable.", "This part of history was also essentially not discussed in Canadian high school history courses until recently. Why don’t the people of the Western world know about this part of history? I think it is a very good question to ask.", "As responsible citizens of Canada, and of the world, it is our responsibility to acknowledge and commemorate the Nanjing Massacre. It is our duty to teach our future generations the actual facts of this important part of history, and we all have to work very hard so that there’s never again another Holocaust or massacre or comfort woman or Boko Haram on this planet.

The government of China states that 300,000 people were killed.", "Speaker, one of the most haunting images that comes out of the attack on Nanjing is one of an infant, maybe a year old, sitting alone, abandoned and crying on a railway platform in a bombed-out station. That image, not as gruesome as many of the others, encompasses the absolute devastation that was wreaked on that population.", "The events did occur. Although remembered in China and other parts of Asia, the knowledge in the rest of the world is limited.

It is, however, contested, without a doubt.", "The newspaper the Guardian reported a month ago that the Japanese government was withholding funds from UNESCO because of documents related to the massacre:", "“Japan is holding back more than £34 million in UNESCO funding following a protest against the listing of documents related to the Nanjing Massacre....", "“Japan—one of UNESCO’s biggest funders—warned last year that it might pull the funding after the UN cultural and scientific body agreed to Beijing’s request to register disputed Chinese documents recording the mass murder and rape committed by Japanese troops after the fall of the Chinese city of Nanjing in 1937.”", "Speaker, in my mind it is entirely clear that we need to face up to and acknowledge the reality of the brutality of the 20th century. We need to be clear about the economic chaos and the great power nationalism that was used by dictators to secure and hold power and the use to which they put that power.", "If we want to help ensure that we don’t repeat the mistakes and massacres of that time, then we need to first remember that they actually happened. We need to remember that assumptions of racial or national superiority lead to the very darkest nights of human experience. We need to remember that scapegoating of individual religions or ethnic groups, when mixed with explosive anger over desperate economic circumstances, can lead to these kinds of large-scale human tragedies, these kinds of large-scale human crimes.", "For the right-wing and nationalist forces in Japan that claim that the massacre never happened, it is very important that the leaders of that country know that the reality is understood, acknowledged and recognized around the world. Our taking this position limits the room for denial of the reality. And that forcing of the recognition of that reality is valuable in its own right.", "For the survivors and their descendants, it’s important that they’re honoured and that their memory is kept alive.", "For the people of Ontario, there is also the recognition that we all came here by many different ways and that our history is rooted in Asia, just as it is rooted in Europe and in Africa; that our makeup as a society has been touched by these historic events and they are as valid and real a part of us as any tragedy or crime against humanity that happened in Europe over the centuries. We are a people of many origins and it is well that we learn all the parts of our origin story.", "Speaker, it’s my hope that this bill passes and becomes part of our memory of history so that we can remember where humanity can go wrong and so that we will take the steps to avoid going down those pathways in the future." ],

It’s a very dark chapter in China’s history.", "To confess, I have never finished a full movie that speaks to the Nanjing Massacre because I just couldn’t go through the entire movie, and even sometimes a documentary.

Babies were sliced open.", "Reverend James McCallum wrote in his diary, where he was hiding, that a thousand women a night were taken away and raped. Some were violated in broad daylight.", "Two 16-year-old girls were raped to death in the refugee camp. At the University of Nanking, 30 women were raped on the spot, some by as many as six men. At the university middle school, soldiers came in 10 times a night. They stole food, they stole clothing, and they raped until they were satisfied. One hundred young girls were raped at Ginling College. At the military college, seven girls were taken; five returned, and they had been raped six or seven times a day.", "If the husbands or brothers intervened, they were shot. Some families were forced into incestuous acts. Sons were forced to rape their mothers, and fathers were forced to rape their daughters. Brutality, bestiality, mass killings, mass graves—they called one of those mass graves, Speaker, “the 10,000-corpse ditch.”", "Hundreds, maybe thousands, of young Chinese men were lined up along the banks of the Yangtze River, machine-gunned and tossed into that river.

Unfortunately, far more places across this world have seen lesser and worse things when it comes to how we as human beings treat each other. We look at what happened to the Jewish community during the Second World War and what happened to other communities during the Second World War as a result of what was inflicted on the part of the Japanese and the Germans.", "But I want people to remember something: Neither the Japanese nor the Germans were uncivilized societies. The Japanese and the Germans were as cultured, as educated and as civilized as any of us here. Yet people decided to take these actions, and people who were not just at the lowest rung—the individuals who actually did the butchering and the raping—but the people at the highest levels of government. If we think that we, as Canadians, North Americans or Europeans, are isolated and it wouldn’t happen to us again, we are sadly mistaken.", "I think when we have occasions like this that come into the Legislature, when we talk about it, it reminds us that every day we have to fight against this. We see it today with Islamophobia in our own nation and across North America in regard to what’s happening in different parts of the world. We see it when it comes to what happens with anti-Semitic actions on the part of people in our own society against Canadians who live here. I remind people that we don’t have a proud history ourselves, to a certain degree, because when the Jews tried to come to Canada prior to 1939, we turned the boats away.", "So I think it’s important that we recognize as citizens—never mind as legislators—that when we go home and we have these conversations with friends and family at occasions at the kitchen table, at the coffee shop or wherever it might be, when we hear people perpetrating lies and hatred against other people because they are different from us, we have to pick up the torch, and we need to move forward and push it back. We have to say to people, “That is unacceptable.”", "This is one very small planet where we are all human beings, whatever colour, language or nationality we might be, or whatever religion it is. We owe it to each other to at least learn how to move forward over time so that we become a civilized place where all people on this planet, all people in this country and all people in this province are respected, and we respect that in law." ],

This is a decision that should be made in the provincial Legislature, not in the back rooms of the Premier’s office, not in quiet, secret agreements with the city of Toronto and the Premier’s office. It’s a decision that should be made in public, accompanied by thoughtful and thorough debate.", "This isn’t a decision that affects just the residents of Toronto, but the entire GTA. This is an added cost for families from across the GTHA, whose lives have already become more and more unaffordable under this Liberal government. Families are already paying among the highest energy rates in North America. Families already pay the highest tax rates in North America, taxes that have increased 20% in just five years; families who sit in gridlock day after day, only to have this government increase vehicle and driver registration fees by—hear this—$503 million in just four years. The list goes on and on.", "There isn’t a fee that this government hasn’t thought about raising or raised. This is a government that just can’t keep their hands out of taxpayers’ pockets. If the government approves these road tolls, life will become much harder for the residents of Ontario. Life will be harder for the parents who drive into Toronto for a child’s doctor’s appointment or a downtown hospital for surgery. Life will be harder for the father who wants to take his family downtown for a special evening or to go to a Leafs game, see a play or have dinner.", "That’s why I introduced this motion. I wanted to give every Liberal member the opportunity to publicly and on the record stand up for their constituents. I wanted to give every Liberal MPP the opportunity to stand up at this afternoon’s vote and say, “Enough is enough. The people who sent us to Queen’s Park can’t afford this added tax.”", "To add insult to injury, commuters will pay to be stuck in traffic. Not only is there too much congestion, they’re going to be paying now to be stuck in traffic because we know this will do nothing to reduce congestion on the DVP or the Gardiner Expressway.", "Those who live in Toronto will see their city roads clogged with people trying to avoid the toll. City staff’s—this is Toronto city staff—independent assessment reported that congestion on main city streets surrounding the DVP and the Gardiner will increase by as much as 29%. Busier, more congested Toronto streets—that’s almost a third more cars on every side street, making it even more difficult to get around the city and for people in the 416 to get to work.", "It’s already difficult.

That should be worrisome for every one of those communities.", "I understand the desperate need to get shovels into the ground for infrastructure and transit. I sympathize with the concerns from municipal leaders that this keeps them up at night, that it’s difficult to make budgets meet.", "But the Liberals have been in power for 13 long years, and throughout those 13 long years, this government has continued to break their transit and infrastructure promises. The reason they’ve broken these infrastructure commitments is because they have wasted billions on scandal and mismanagement. As a result, Ontarians have been left to suffer in gridlock. The lack of transit—this gridlock in the GTA—speaks for itself.", "For many commuters in both the 416 and the 905, the Gardiner and the DVP are the only option. Why should Ontario residents, already struggling to get by, be forced to pay yet another added tax because of the Wynne Liberal’s record of negligence?", "We continue to see examples of Liberal infrastructure incompetence every single day. In the 2014 provincial election, Premier Wynne promised voters the largest infrastructure investment in our province’s history. The people of Ontario are still waiting. We haven’t seen it. This is yet another broken promise.", "In 2015, when Premier Kathleen Wynne announced the fire sale of Hydro One, she said it was for transit. She said that she had to have this fire sale of a key asset to pay for transit. Surprise, surprise—not a cent from the fire sale of Hydro One has gone to transit and infrastructure." ],

Think about that: Repave them after three years; it should have been 15.

It’s clear just how badly this government is spending—apologies, I shouldn’t say “spending”; I should say wasting—wasting money allocated for transit and infrastructure. This is money that should be repairing infrastructure, building transit and getting shovels into the ground. Taxpayer dollars are precious, and the notion that they continue to waste and mismanage is heartbreaking for families in Ontario who want to see their taxpayer dollars spent appropriately.", "Instead of forcing municipalities to look for new revenue tools—you can call it a revenue tool; it’s a tax. A revenue tool is a tax. The Wynne Liberals, rather than looking at new code words to call a tax, should look at savings within how they manage infrastructure dollars. Maybe if we weren’t building bridges upside down or repaving roads prematurely we wouldn’t have to look at new taxes that they never campaigned on and they were actually against. The Premier, as Minister of Transportation, was against tolls. That shows how inconsistent this government has been.", "Mayor Tory has, without a doubt, been put in a difficult position. He has been trying to keep the city’s head above water. Municipalities have been forced to work for the scraps at this table of waste of this Liberal government. They shouldn’t be put in that position. But I understand that because of the underfunding, because of the mismanagement, they don’t have the resources. That’s on this government’s watch.", "The reality is that I’m not surprised. I hope the Premier and the Liberal caucus will vote for our motion today, but I don’t expect it because they have yet to meet a tax they do not like. That is their culture. They want more taxation; they want more ineffective, mismanaged government.", "The Liberal caucus, though, is composed of many members from across the GTA, from suburban ridings like North York, Etobicoke and Scarborough. I think that rather than taking their cues from the Premier’s office, they should listen to what their constituents are saying, because it’s loud and clear: They do not want these tolls. They do not want to pay for roads that they have already paid for. They will be the ones who will be stuck in traffic. They will be the ones who have this new added cost to their life in the GTA.", "That’s probably the reason we’re seeing so many municipal leaders stand up against this. Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie said that John Tory “has chosen to implement road tolls that will not only affect residents in his city, but those in the 905.” So this provincial approval for the city of Toronto is now going to cost the people of Mississauga more.", "You had Oshawa Mayor John Henry, who said, “There is just no more money left for the people. Would they support this in Oshawa? Absolutely not.”", "Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti said, “Using road tolls to finance Toronto’s transportation infrastructure places an unfair tax on the 905.”", "So you’ve got the Markham mayor, the Mississauga mayor and the Oshawa mayor all pointing out that this is a tax on the entire 905. You have business leaders in the 416 saying that this is going to make getting product to marketplace more expensive. You have families saying they can’t afford this new tax.", "The worry is, if this government says yes to Toronto, then, following this logic, are they not going to say yes to Mississauga, Oshawa and Markham, who all want a revenue stream? They’re going to be dishonest if they say they support Toronto’s request but wouldn’t support another municipality. We’re going to start a war of tolls, and do you know who loses, Mr. Speaker? Every single commuter in the GTA.", "The sad thing about this is that while every driver pays more, while there is more gridlock because of this mistake—why are we here? This is only because of this government’s mismanagement. They did not honour their 2014 election promise: The funds from the hydro fire sale did not go to infrastructure. Because they can’t monitor contracts and have proper oversight, they’re trying to make up for their mistake by allowing municipalities to put these big taxes on drivers. It’s not right.", "In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, think of the families who are already feeling the pinch. Think of the infrastructure and transit promises that this Liberal government has broken. I urge the Liberal members to do the right thing: to stand up for affordability in Toronto, to show they are listening and to say no to tolls in TO. That’s the right thing to do. Stand up for the people of Toronto. Stand up for the people throughout the 905. It’s the right thing to do." ],

We used to pay capital costs, part of it, when it came to transit equipment. We used to pay for municipal roads; they were provincial highways back then. We had services that we, the province, maintained and didn’t download onto the municipalities.", "The Liberals in opposition—my God, if you closed your eyes and you listened to them, you thought they had to be New Democrats, because they were yelling on this side of the House when the Conservatives went to the government side, when they started undoing the things that had been a long-established way of doing things in the province of Ontario. And what do they do, the Liberals, when they get to the government side of the House? Do they upload 50% of the cost of transit back to the province? No, Mr. Speaker, they didn’t.", "Did they then say, “We’re going to take back all of those thousands of miles of provincial highways we’ve downloaded onto municipalities”? No, Mr. Speaker. If anything, they did worse: They privatized the rest of the winter road maintenance. They privatized the rest of MTO when it comes to engineering. Now we pay more and we get less. So I say a pox on both their houses.", "The other point I want to make, which I think is an important one, is that you’ve got the Conservatives, who go around the province saying, “We can’t get in the way of municipalities to make their own decisions,” and the provincial government shouldn’t stand in the way and dictate to the local level of government what it is they can and can’t do when it comes to providing services in their province. Well, you can’t have it both ways. I would agree that we shouldn’t allow tolls in the province of Ontario, but you can’t say, on the one hand, as Conservatives, “We don’t believe that we should stand in the way of municipalities,” but then go and chastise the Liberals for doing exactly what you’re telling them they should do in the first place.", "I find that a little bit ironic, that the Conservatives are taking this position.", "If we are in the spot today that a municipality like Toronto or Mississauga or whomever feels that they’ve got to put tolls on highways, it’s because we started that long, slippery slope of off-loading the responsibility from the federal and provincial governments to maintain transit and to do the things that have to be done in transportation—and we’ve off-loaded them onto municipalities. We should not be surprised that municipalities are pinched and trying to find a way to pay the bills and to do what needs to be done.", "We are the only G7 nation in the world that doesn’t support inter-urban transit and inner-city transit in the way that is done normally in other parts of the world.", "So I say to my Conservative friends and I say to my Liberal friends: If we want to fix this, what we need to do, as senior levels of government, is to take responsibility for what should be part of our responsibility. That’s why Andrea Horwath and New Democrats, in the last election, said that we would upload 50% of the operational costs of transit in order to be able to give municipalities the room that they need to be able to run transit in their municipalities in a way that makes some sense.", "I’m sure other members from my caucus would love to join in on this debate." ],

At that time, I warned Ontario motorists that while it may be the QEW today, we all know we’ll be seeing tolls coming to a highway near you, as the minister pushes his latest revenue tool down our roads. And here we go—the QEW, the Gardiner, the DVP. If the Liberals get their way, 905 and 416 residents will be immersed in an all-out offensive toll war, where roads we’ve already paid for are turned into cash machines funded on the backs of motorists. It’s called highway robbery, and we’re calling on members of the other side of the House to join us in putting a stop to it.", "We all know what’s behind Liberal tolling plans: 13 years of massive waste and an infrastructure deficit that grows as the government spends more on mismanagement and scandal, meaning less for transportation needs. Instead of making an effort to stop the waste to help meet transit needs, this government simply throws up its hands and turns to the already taxed-off motorists to pay their bills.", "Motorists already pay vehicle taxes, Drive Clean fees and the gas tax every day they pull up to the pump. So what’s another tax, another toll, another fee? Well, it may be touted as $2 a ride, but for the average worker who has no choice but to drive the DVP or Gardiner, it will mean a $1,000 pay cut—$1,000 a year for the privilege of trying to get to work on roads they’ve already paid for.", "What makes it worse is the fact that the Conference Board of Canada has told us that GTHA motorists already pay 100% of area road costs. New road tolls on the Gardiner and the DVP would mean they’d be paying more than 100%—sounds like Liberal economics to me. They also go on to say, as well as our friends over at the CAA, due to a recent report that indicates that policy-makers have many tools at hand to make road pricing a last resort—the last resort, as opposed to the first.", "In a government wading in waste and costly mismanagement, the first priority to find needed infrastructure dollars should be cutting the waste and delivering it to the priorities we all share. Speaker, you don’t have to be a mathematician to figure out that the billions being wasted add up to the needed road funding that tolls are supposed to be directed at. Heck, there are millions that the auditor just revealed in her report last week: $8 million in bonuses to companies paving our roads, despite evidence of falsified test samples; $23 million for highway road repairs after three years, on roads that should have lasted 15; a $39-million contract for a company that built a bridge upside down. Again, as I noted, it doesn’t take a math whiz to see how these numbers add up.", "That’s just this year’s auditor’s report—just scratching the surface, of course. Last year, the auditor highlighted that the Union Station train shed that had gone $50 million above estimates, that much-delayed Burlington GO expansion that had exceeded its budget by $5 million, and, of course, the subsidized UP ghost express. The list goes on. I haven’t even mentioned the biggies: a billion for eHealth and another for non-existent gas plants.", "So when it comes to today’s vote, the Liberal members have a telling choice to make. They can publicly stand up for the best interests of their constituents, for affordability and say no to tolls, or they can defend a tax-and-spend-and-spend-and-spend Premier. From where I’m standing, it looks like a pretty easy choice: “no” to TO tolls." ],

People are struggling to make ends meet, to pay their rising hydro bills and to put food on the table. In the Durham region, about 30% of all workers commute into Toronto each and every day. Not only does this put a strain on their schedules, as the average travel time to get to work is about 65 minutes, but it puts a strain on their budgets too. For the drivers, between gas, upkeep and wear and tear on their vehicles, the costs keep growing. And when you are commuting for over two hours a day in Ontario, snow tires become a necessity—and a cost—for your safety. But this is the reality for thousands of people in my riding and tens, if not hundreds, of thousands across the Durham region. These are people that have been forced to leave our community to find work because the jobs just aren’t there. That is the reality under this Liberal government. It is this reality that is facing Ontarians across the province.", "Now we are discussing whether people in my community can afford to pay more. We are discussing whether the families that are fighting to pay their hydro bills every month just to keep the lights on at home can afford to spend more to get to their jobs in the first place. We’re debating the wrong thing. This shouldn’t be just about how much more the poor or working people in our communities are going to have to pay to take the bus or drive on roads. We should be focusing on what this government is prepared to do to make transit options more accessible to all Ontarians.", "Right now, the city of Toronto is desperately looking for ways to pay for transit because the province has left them high and dry. Historically, the province used to match the city dollar for dollar on what it invested in transit, but that isn’t happening under this government. If it were happening, it would put more money into transit than what road tolls are projected to do. Let me just say that again: If the province simply matched the city’s transit spending like it used to, we would see $279 million invested in transit instead of the $200 million that will come from road tolls on the backs of commuters from my community.", "The reason that municipalities are under pressure is because this government has abandoned them.

Again, they have made bad choices and left us holding the bills. Again, their problems are ours, and not the other way around.", "Ontarians across the province are worried about how they will pay their bills, how they’ll put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads.

Then they’re left to the mercy of short-term disability plans or the benevolence of their employers.", "“It’s absurd that the law recognizes the need for a parent to be with their child as they face a critical illness, but then, upon the child’s death, they’re expected to return to work almost immediately. Similarly, it does not make sense that the law provides up to 52 weeks for maternity and parental leave to facilitate the bond between parent and child, but when the natural order of life is turned upside-down and a child dies, there is no similar leave.”", "Meighan set it out clearly and plainly. The emotional impact of this is difficult to comprehend. When I was preparing to speak to this issue, I found that I had to hold myself in emotionally, because if you go too deeply into this, it is extraordinarily difficult to manage. But I think about those parents who are dealing with the unthinkable—the state of shock, the state of loss that they’re going through, and the fact that not only are they dealing with that loss and that shock, but that they have to think about how they will continue at work and how they will be productive, when, frankly, even thinking things through clearly in that state of mind is extraordinarily difficult. It’s easy to understand that a person would not be social, let alone productive, for months after the loss.", "Now, Mr. Leitao worked with a lawyer at SickKids hospital to do a first draft of this bill and sent along a more academic but still moving explanation of what is at stake and what is under consideration. I’m going to quote because I don’t think I can put it any more clearly:", "“The death of a child is one of the most painful events that an adult can experience and is linked to complicated and traumatic grief reactions. For parents, the death can result in severe anxiety and other negative emotions associated with loss. For most parents, the child’s death precipitates a severe crisis of meaning as the death represented an unnatural departure from the order of life’s events. The time course for parental grief is uncertain and can be expected to show great variability. Research suggests that, to the extent one can identify a typical timeline of grief, it begins with shock and intense grief for two weeks, followed by two months of strong grieving, and then a slow recovery that takes about two years. However, recovery does not mean closure, nor an end to grieving.", "“Many of these parents do not feel they are emotionally, mentally and perhaps physically ready to return to the workplace. They may not feel they are able to function effectively, or they may not feel prepared to face questions or even sympathy from those who have not suffered such a loss. For many parents the only solace is in associating with those who have suffered a similar loss, especially in the first months following death.”", "I want to say to you in this chamber that when a parent goes through a loss like this, they absolutely must have time to heal. Unfortunately, what’s currently on offer is not adequate. I will continue the quote from that communication I was reading:", "“The Employment Standards Act S.O.2000, c.41 provides statutory protective leaves of absence for parents whose child dies as a result of a crime for up to 104 weeks and leave up to 52 weeks for parents whose child has disappeared” and it is probable that the disappearance was linked to a crime.", "“However, for parents whose child dies as a result of a traumatic event such as an accident, or suicide, or as a result of a sudden or prolonged illness, the grief is no less palpable, and the death may be as unexpected and even if expected, as impossible to prepare for emotionally. Yet for these parents there is no such statutory protection for leave from the workplace in order to grieve.", "“Their grief is deeply discounted under the” Employment Standards Act. “It is expected that they may take 10 personal emergency days” under the act “and then return to work. If they do not feel they are ready they must make show that they qualify for medical leave; in other words, they must pathologize their response to their loss in order to show that it meets a standard of mental disorder. Alternately, they may have to file a human rights complaint on the basis of family status. Once again, they must justify their inability to work, and prove their employer’s duty to accommodate them.", "“Adding insult to already grievous injury under the” Employment Standards Act, “parents who have been granted time off under the critically ill children leave must immediately end the leave on the death of their child....", "“The Employment Standards Act needs to be amended so as to allow parents whose children have died, and it is not a result of their own criminal act, 52 weeks protected leave under the Employment Standards Act. This is both equitable and compassionate.", "“The numbers are not sufficiently large to pose an unfair burden on employers. The Paediatric Death Review Committee cites that the average number of child deaths in the province of Ontario between 2005 and 2011 is 1,122.”", "Speaker, you need to know that this bill is supported by Bereaved Families of Ontario, who wrote us a letter of support last year. I will read from the letter from Carolyn Baltaz, board chair of Bereaved Families of Ontario.", "“It is my pleasure to write a letter on behalf of Bereaved Families of Ontario and our 11 affiliates in support of the proposed Jonathan’s Law ... brought before the Legislative Assembly.", "“We are a not-for-profit, charitable organization that offers peer-to-peer grief support to bereaved parents when they experience the death of a child at any age. We believe grief support helps bereaved parents feel less isolated and better equipped to deal with everyday life in regard to relationships, returning to work and their mental and physical health.", "“Grieving is hard work for both the mind and body and we know the journey bereaved parents take after suffering the death of their child is a long and winding road. Parents returning to work while still in the initial shock of their child’s death adds many layers to their grief. We support this initiative as we believe the protected time offered under this bill will help our parents return to their communities productive and engaged.”", "I have a clear memory of the first parent I knew who had lost a child. I was in my mid-20s. Jennifer’s son, aged eight, had died from leukemia. Her son was a little red-headed guy with tremendous energy, the kind of kid who seemed unstoppable. Jennifer was a strong woman, a single mom.", "I remember walking down Bain Avenue in my riding. It was a cold day. It was late March. Jennifer was out in her front yard, digging up the flower bed. This was a week after her son had died. She was preparing for the return of the sun, the return of life to our community, to her home. That day was cold and it was raw. I remember stopping to commiserate with her, and at the time—and even decades later—I was struck first by the extraordinary and intense grief that she was grappling with. I was also struck by her resolve, equally strong, to prepare for the return of life.", "I say to you, Speaker, that we need to help all those parents who have suffered a great blow and are now preparing for life to come back. We need to change the law so they can collect themselves, rebuild their strength and fully reengage with life.", "Obviously, I will ask everyone present in this chamber to vote for this bill, but I also ask the government to use its power to either move this bill forward through committee and to third reading or bring in its own legislation. I am not picky; I just want to make sure that parents who deal with this have the full support of society and the opportunity to heal themselves." ],

Years later, it would still come back and she would talk about some of the—not a lot about it, but some of the other things that happened at that time that really highlighted just how, after 40 or 50 years, you never get over it.

Having our own children today—it’s your worst nightmare.", "My two first cousins, just a couple of years apart, same thing: two farming accidents. It was extremely hard on the family. I always remember that my first cousin was a priest, Father Kevin O’Brien. At my uncle’s funeral, he was talking about when Ray’s son Kevin died. Ray and Katherine were quite religious. His comment, when talking to him, was, “I think of how lucky I was to have him for 19 years,” and at that point, Father Kevin broke down. He said it was tough to believe that people could have that much faith.", "When you looked at how it affected the family and the first cousins, you could see the parents’ pain.

It takes time.", "A year seems like a long time, but really, with a loss it just isn’t a long time. As you get close to people who have been impacted, even myself with a brother, you still think back. We were fairly close, a year apart, we went to school together and we did a lot of things together. As a parent it’s much different. I just can’t imagine the trouble.", "Today, we’re a little better.

However, if a child dies as a result of an accident, suicide or illness, there is no similar statutory protection to allow employees the time needed to help process and deal with grief. This is astounding.", "While the ESA does allow for time off to care for sick children under its critically ill children leave provision, parents are required to immediately end the leave and return to work once the child dies. This strikes me as incredibly callous and unreasonable. The death of a child is a traumatic experience for parents regardless of cause, and while the grieving process is different for each parent and something that one would never truly get over, parental bereavement studies have shown that time off is desperately needed.", "Instead of acknowledging and understanding the trauma caused by the loss of a child, under the current system parents are often forced to prove their qualifications for other types of medical leave or look to protections under human rights legislation in order to protect their jobs while they deal with the loss of a child.

But he had parents and he was a son, and I know what they went through. In a terribly sad way—I was there with them—also because they’ve lost a daughter. They had three children, and they lost two of them. They lost their first child at a very young age due to a health emergency. Ironically, she died at the same hospital as my husband did, which deepened their sad and tragic loss. She was only a year and a half. She was rushed into emergency and she died very suddenly and tragically. Jean and George, my late husband’s parents, were young parents. They had three children. They were both under the age of 25. For them to try to pick up their lives and pick up the pieces of that after having lost a child so suddenly and tragically, and then to lose another child on top of that, was, as so many people have said today, something that’s outside the natural order of things—I know what that did to them and I know what it did to our family. So I think this is such a timely and important conversation.", "I also lost a sister, at the age of 42. My mom lost her husband and then her child within 18 months of each other. Again, there was another loss of a child—outside the parameters of the member opposite’s bill, because these were older children, but I think a loss of a child, like the loss of a parent or someone you love, no matter what the age is, is a sudden and tragic loss. The loss of a child, in particular, is very, very difficult.", "I am pleased to see that Bereaved Families of Ontario, though not surprisingly, is supportive of this, because they would understand, like so many organizations that help bereaved families do, that the stress that families experience when they lose a child so quickly is so incredible and so overwhelming. You feel like you are in a fog. People have talked about it.", "That’s certainly how I felt after I lost my husband. I had to stop working—I couldn’t work. So if I had to stop working, I can only imagine what it is like to be a parent and try to pick up the pieces, try to go back to work and try to cope. To have this kind of legislation and that comfort of knowing that you have a job to go back to is just an important, important issue for all of us to remember. It allows you the comfort to work—because when you go back to work and you’ve had that kind of life-changing event, you’re not at full capacity. You’re just not.", "There is a moral imperative for this legislation, but there’s an economic one, too, if I may cite some statistics I found in researching this topic today. There is an institute in California called the Grief Recovery Institute Educational Foundation, and they talk about the economic costs of loss and grief in the workplace. They have estimated it at a stunning $75 billion. They talk about that in the context of—I’ll quote them. They say, “Measuring emotional pain, of course, is far from an exact science.” I think that’s right, because grief can remain hidden. Reducing the cost of grief, by understanding that workers will need support beyond the usual three to four days, really is in an employer’s interest. So while this is incredibly important from an empathetic point of view, it’s also an economic issue, too. That’s why I applaud the member opposite for bringing this private member’s bill forward.", "When you think of the amount of time we spend at work, it’s important to realize and understand that it’s impractical to suggest that people can go back to work and sometimes shelve their emotions and put them in a closet or on a shelf for eight to 10 hours while they try to concentrate. I think that’s almost an impossible task, and we shouldn’t be asking them to do that. It’s far too hard on them. I think that employers, especially those that have EAPs, employee assistance programs—and so many of them do—understand that employees need support when they’ve had this kind of dramatic and often sudden loss.", "In closing, I want to again salute the Leitaos for their advocacy and for taking their loss into something important, and for sharing it so publicly with all of us. It’s very, very difficult to do. Time really is the best healer, and that’s what this bill is about. It’s a pleasure to stand in this House and speak to something so terribly important.

Many families who experience the loss of a child have other children at home, and they have to take the time to try to support those brothers and sisters who are also grieving. This bill would allow the time for them to do that. It would help them through that heart-wrenching journey of recovery that they are engaged in as they try to recover from the loss of the child.", "It would also bring bereavement rights for parents of children who die in line with parents who have lost children because of specific circumstances. As the member for Toronto–Danforth pointed out, parents of children who die in an accident or due to illness have 10 days of leave under the Employment Standards Act, while parents of children who die as the result of a crime are entitled to unpaid leave for up to 104 weeks. Granting parents, as this bill does, 52 weeks of unpaid leave, while protecting their job, would recognize that the loss of a child is a tragedy regardless of the circumstances that led to that loss. In this way, Jonathan’s Law addresses a gap that exists in current legislation that unfairly disadvantages Ontarians who are going through unbearable hardship.", "I understand that there may be some concerns about the impact of this bill on workforces, but as the member across the way pointed out, ensuring that employees are able to return to work fully engaged and productive is a huge benefit to the economy and to workplaces across this province.

It happens to be rules that govern the workplace, but it really is something that tells us how we feel about each other, how we respect each other, how we understand each other and how we help ourselves through times when times can get pretty tough.", "Often we think that sometimes we put an awful lot of emphasis on our jobs, and there are days when you wonder if you work to live or live to work. Often it should be a balance of those things, I think. I think that when the time comes, when we as individuals—as mothers or fathers, brothers and sisters—hit those really tough times in our lives, when we hit those things that we didn’t ever anticipate we’d ever have to deal with, that’s when we need to ensure that we’ve got the right rules in effect, that we’ve done the right thing, that it’s covered off, that you don’t have to think about, “Do I have a job anymore? Do I have to go to work in a couple of days?”, and that you can actually do the most important thing that anybody would be expected to do at that point in time.", "I think that what we’re talking about today, Speaker, is the period of grief that has to follow the demise, the death, of a child. I can’t imagine what it’s like. I haven’t been through it. There are people in the room today who have, and I think they’re giving us very, very good advice. As the Minister of Labour, I can tell the member from Toronto–Danforth that I’m listening, and I support it." ],

We’re discussing giving parents leave without pay for up to 52 weeks if they lose a child.", "I want to commend the member for Toronto–Danforth. Even though it’s a difficult topic to bring forward at the end of the session, it’s important. It’s important to have a discussion about what it means to live in a civilized society where we support each other. We often hear the expression that it takes a village to raise a child; well, it also takes a village to support the family when a child has to be buried. It’s difficult when you go to a cemetery and you see the tombstones for adults, but there is a section for children—a very tiny section, hopefully, in most cemeteries—and that’s a real heart-breaker.", "But it’s not just the parents who deserve our support. Of course, we all want to offer our support to the parents, but also the extended family: the siblings, the grandparents. I think that very often there’s much more that we can do in the school system, if a child loses a sibling, to educate our teachers, our principals and our other professionals on how to deal with it. I think too often people are sort of uncomfortable with a difficult topic, and so they just ignore it. That actually makes the situation a lot worse, as we know.", "The member from Eglinton–Lawrence brought forward last year a bill to help parents who lost a child to stillbirth or during the development process of the fetus. Again, why aren’t those parents given the support they need? It’s because people are uncomfortable. I think that it’s time for us to address those difficult topics.", "We all think about our own families and our own children. As a parent of four children who have made it to adulthood just this year—all four of them, and hopefully they will continue in that vein—we cannot imagine the difficulty that families experience, and we want to offer our support to Jonathan’s parents, who are here today.", "We were also talking recently about legislation to have four parents registered as the parents. Well, that also brings into question—all four parents will need support from their employers. The workplace becomes a difficult place, and we have to show support for small businesses, but we have to first primarily put our support with the parents who are grieving, and with the other family members as well.", "I didn’t hear until I was in my late teens about my mother’s brother, who was what they used to call a blue baby, which is that they’re born with a hole in their heart. Today it’s such a simple operation to fix for a baby, but my mother’s brother lived only 16 days. I don’t think my grandparents ever recovered from it—only 16 days, yet they bonded with the child—and the family didn’t speak of it. I felt guilty that I didn’t know about it. How would I have known about it? Nobody spoke about it.", "But we do need to speak about these things, and that’s what I really commend about Jonathan’s Law. It’s not just about addressing the fact that parents need support, but addressing the fact that as a society we need to speak about things openly, show our support for all the family members, friends and neighbours, and work together so that everybody gets the support they need." ],

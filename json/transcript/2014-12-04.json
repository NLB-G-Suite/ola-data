Previously, this was a bill that was introduced by the MPP from Don Valley East. The former minister introduced a very similar bill, but that was not able to pass because of the election. I just want to thank him for his wonderful work. He did tremendous work and lots of preparation—basically made my life a bit easier.", "Immigration is a big file in my ministry. It’s quite dear to me because I am a first-generation immigrant. Immigration is a file of great significance. People say Ontario is a land of immigrants; in fact, it is. People say Ontario is filled by migrants; in fact, it is. As remarked on by our Premier many, many times, other than the aboriginal people, we are all migrants who came to this great land at one point in time; in fact, we are.", "As recently as this Monday, Speaker, I had a conversation with the consul general of Korea; as a matter of fact, he was here yesterday sitting in the Speaker’s gallery. He told me that he was so amazed by the fact that more than half the population of Toronto were not born in Toronto; they were born outside of Toronto. He was very amazed by the fact that we came from more than 200 countries, speaking more than 130 languages. We are truly the face of the world.", "Leaving one’s hometown, travelling afar, some perhaps thousands and thousands of kilometres to a new land, is not a light-hearted decision; it’s difficult. Needless to say, there are many challenges, obstacles, difficulties, barriers—you name it.", "Over the years, we have heard many immigrant stories—many. Some of them may be good; some are bad; some can be ugly. Just like the western movie with Clint Eastwood: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. But one thing is for sure: There are never-ending immigrant stories. I would say that every immigrant has his or her own story. Being a first-generation immigrant, I too have a story to tell. I came here quite a while ago. I came here 45 years ago now. I came in September, 1969, in the fall. I was a young man, full of energy, perhaps full of great expectation." ],

I was picked up by a friend of my father. When I landed in this great land, I encountered a problem. It’s quite an interesting problem. My problem was that I could not talk to people, I could not communicate with people, because at that time my English-speaking skills were limited. When I talked to people, they could not understand me; when they talked to me, I could not understand them. I had a problem: I could not talk to people.", "So I thought, “Chinatown is always around. Why don’t you go and talk to those Canadian Chinese?” But I still had the problem, because I spoke a different dialect. The Chinese community at the time spoke something that I did not understand. So when they talked to me in their Chinese dialect, I would move these; when I talked to them, they would return the favour, do the same thing like this. So I really had a problem. I could not talk to people.", "In November 1969, I was lucky enough to find a job. It was, I would say, a perfect job—a bit humbling. I found a job working in a Chinese food takeout restaurant. It’s still there; it’s still operating. It’s at the corner of Martin Grove and Burnhamthorpe in Etobicoke Centre. That’s the riding there. It’s at the northeast corner of Martin Grove and Burnhamthorpe. The name is Far East Chinese Food. The job was quite simple. I learned the job working in the basement. Speaker, you may like Chinese food, right? Chinese food is famous for those egg rolls. I was the one down in the basement mixing the plum sauce powder with some water in a little cup and putting a lid on it so that you can really enjoy your egg roll." ],

Ontario has relied upon immigrants from its earliest beginning. We continue to do so today. Ontario is the number one destination for newcomers to Canada. We receive more immigrants than the combined total of all the provinces and territories west of us.", "That’s all good, but we need to make some changes so that immigration continues to work for us long into the future. Our population is aging, birth rates remain low and baby boomers are leaving the workforce in increasing numbers. We need to ensure that Ontario businesses have the skilled workers they need to stay competitive in today’s global economy.", "Over the next 10 years, there will be more than 2.5 million job openings, the majority high-skilled. Our homegrown talent in Ontario will not be able to meet this demand alone. Newcomers already make up 30% of our workforce right now. We will need more skilled immigrants to help us fill those jobs and keep the economy growing.", "An important part of Ontario’s economy is trade. This is one of many areas where our diversity is a huge strength. Newcomers bring international connections and networks that drive economic growth. The more immigrants we have, the more we can tap into new markets; and the more we trade, the more jobs we create. It’s as simple as that. This natural connection between trade and immigration is why the Premier appointed me as Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and International Trade. On these two fronts—trade and building a skilled workforce—Bill 49 is very important to our future.", "Two years ago this month, our government announced Ontario’s first-ever immigration strategy. Bill 49 is the logical next step. If passed, Ontario will be only the second province or territory in the country to have its own immigration legislation.", "The other day, the member from Windsor–Tecumseh—I call him Mr. Good Morning—gave incorrect information on this score. It is important to be accurate in the information we share with the people of Ontario, so let me repeat: Ontario is only the second province in the country, after Quebec, to introduce immigration legislation.", "Bill 49, if passed, would help us achieve three goals. First, it would make possible a stronger immigration partnership between Ontario and the federal government in the areas of recruitment, selection and admission of skilled immigrants. Let me speak to this for a moment. For some time, Ontario has been asking for more say and control over who comes here. We believe Ontario is in the best position to know its labour force needs. Our government is continually working with employers and different communities to assess these needs, yet federal policies have a very real impact on who is allowed to come to Ontario. Federal decisions over the decade have reduced the proportion of economic immigrants coming to Ontario to 46%. Other provinces on average receive 65%. This imbalance has hurt our economy, and because Ontario is the engine of growth in Canada, this imbalance has hurt the nation’s economy.", "The second goal is to strengthen our immigration strategy to raise the economic immigrants total to 70%. So we must start now. It has been my pleasure to meet with Ontario employers around the province at the annual forum called the Minister’s Employers Table. Our employers know what is at stake and their interest is high in making our immigration system work better. I am encouraged by the willingness of our employers to work with our government to get this right. Where we need to do a better job and where Bill 49 is going to help us is in attracting a higher share of economic-class immigrants.", "If passed, the bill will improve the accountability, transparency and management of our provincial nominee program. We are counting on the PNP to help us attract more skilled workers in Ontario. The PNP is an important program for Ontario and will become even more so in the future. Some 97% of PNP nominees remain in Ontario. Our provincial nominee program is helping Ontario employers attract and retain the skills they need for today’s knowledge-based economy. Our goal is to work with the federal government to expand this program even further.", "More than 100,000 newcomers arrive in Ontario every year. Bill 49 affirms our strong commitment to settlement programs that help newcomers integrate into our economy and society and contribute to Ontario. Our government has invested more than $900 million since 2003 doing exactly that: on bridging training, on language training and other important settlement assistance that helps newcomers succeed.", "The third goal of Bill 49 is to help strengthen our ongoing efforts to reduce fraud and detect misrepresentation. It would help protect the integrity of our immigrant selection program and improve accountability.", "To sum up, Bill 49 would be a beginning, not an end. It is a necessary first step Ontario must take if we are to attract more skilled immigrants to drive our economy and keep Ontario strong. So I ask this House to give speedy approval to Bill 49 and allow Ontario to begin charting more of our own course to ensure we have the skilled workers to keep us strong and globally competitive. We want immigrants to come here and plant deep roots, build strong communities and become great citizens. Because when newcomers succeed, Ontario succeeds. Thank you very much." ],

Ontario is only the second province in Canada to bring forward immigration legislation, and I’m very proud of our government’s leadership in this area. Last week, the member from Windsor–Tecumseh stated incorrectly that Ontario is the last province to bring forward its own immigration legislation. It’s a basic point of fact that Ontario is the second province, after Quebec, to introduce its own immigration legislation. I want to set this record straight at the outset, because Ontarians deserve clarity and accuracy. They do not deserve to be misled.", "As the minister stated, this bill is very important for newcomers and for employers, and it’s vitally important for Ontario. In fact, just last week I was in Windsor meeting with employers and talking about immigration, and those employers urged our government to continue playing a leadership role.", "I have one more point of accuracy before I move on. Despite comments to the contrary in this House last week, Ontario remains the number one destination for newcomers to Canada. The sky-is-falling scenarios from the other side of the House just don’t add up. In fact, Ontario receives more immigrants than the combined total of all the provinces and territories west of here.", "More importantly, passing Bill 49 would make Ontario more competitive by drawing on the talents of every Ontarian and attracting the world’s best and brightest. Our success in immigration policy, of course, relies on effective co-operation with the federal government. The bottom line is that we want to work with Ottawa to ensure that the right numbers of immigrants with the right skill sets come to Ontario to support our economic growth, which in turn supports Canada’s prosperity.", "The proposed immigration legislation would help us do just that. The stakes are high. We have to ensure that we are meeting demographic challenges and attracting the skilled and talented newcomers who help grow our local economies. In my remarks today, I’d like to focus on the economic contributions newcomers make to Ontario and how these contributions are needed today more than ever.", "First, I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge the deep and enduring contributions newcomers have made to the quality of life we enjoy today. At every stage of Ontario’s history, newcomers offered skills, knowledge, optimism and hard work that advanced our economy and enriched our communities. Speaker, looking around this House here today, I see many members who, like myself, are children of immigrants or immigrants themselves. We can all personally identify with and attest to the struggle to get established in a new country, to learn new customs and a new language, to open a bank account, find a house and pick a school.", "Our family arrived in Toronto from Portugal in 1970 and settled in the riding of Davenport. I went straight into kindergarten and began the process of adaptation. Most newcomers will tell you it’s easier for children to adapt. My father attended ESL classes—and thank goodness they were available. But I’m grateful to my parents for giving me the opportunity to grow up in Canada and to be here today in this House.", "These are the experiences newcomers share with each other and help each other with. Immigrants chose Ontario because there was economic opportunity and the freedom to pursue it. Those contributions from immigrants in turn made the economy even stronger and broadened opportunity for the newcomers who followed. This is how immigration has traditionally worked in Ontario, but we cannot take it for granted. As the global economy continues to struggle, and as Ontario industries face global competition, we are counting on newcomers today more than ever before. We know that newcomers today are finding it harder to become established compared to previous generations of newcomers. At the same time, Ontario is facing competition from other countries that also want to attract skilled, bright and entrepreneurial immigrants. The Ontario Immigration Act would position Ontario for success in this global economic environment.", "As we all know, talent is the most sought-after commodity in today’s economy. Entrepreneurial spirit, cultural knowledge and creative thinking make economies more innovative and creative. Newcomers have a strong commitment to education. Three out of every four newcomers arrive with at least one post-secondary degree. Newcomers bring innovative ideas and unique perspectives; they make valuable contributions to emerging industries like information technology, engineering and bioscience.", "It’s worth noting that a recent study by the Partnership for a New American Economy found that seven of the most valuable brands in the world, including Apple, Google, AT&T and IBM, come from companies founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants.", "We’ve seen similar successes here in Ontario: Plastic Mobile, the firm where the previous version of this bill was announced last winter, is a good example of an innovative, leading-edge firm founded by immigrants and employing dozens of Ontarians. Many successful firms in Ontario are founded by immigrants. They are doing innovative work in creating jobs and wealth for Ontario.", "We also know that, to a large degree, economic success for Ontario comes down to trade; that’s the foundation of our success. In the global economy, Ontario’s cultural diversity gives us a clear edge. Ontarians come from more than 200 countries and speak about 200 languages. Our diversity helps Ontario companies understand new markets and recognize opportunities.", "As we all know, we need more small and medium-sized companies exporting beyond North America. That’s what our government’s Going Global Trade Strategy is all about. Our effort to tap into new markets is greatly enhanced by people who speak different languages, have international networks and understand different business cultures. The personal knowledge and contacts of newcomers can make those markets a little less intimidating, and thanks to our diversity, people in those markets become more familiar with Ontario. When we take trade missions to other parts of the world, we’re in a position to tell people that we have welcomed their country’s contributions to Ontario society.", "I give credit to our Premier, who realized the natural connection between immigration and international trade when she appointed my colleague, the member from Markham, as minister last June. She said to the minister: “Take Ontario’s diversity to the next level. Help our newcomers build these connections to their former homelands in a way that benefits everyone.” We saw what success in this area looks like with the fantastic results of the China trade mission in October. Almost 2,000 new jobs will be created in Ontario thanks to the strong and enduring connections between China and Ontario.", "Of course, it’s about more than just trade. With an aging population, low birth rates and retiring baby boomers, we are counting on skilled immigrants to continue helping to meet future labour needs. Our success in utilizing the skills and talents of newcomers will largely determine whether Ontario reaches its full economic potential. The Conference Board of Canada tells us that the cost of underutilizing the skills of internationally trained individuals is about $3.4 billion to $5 billion in lost productivity. That means that if we want immigrants to choose Ontario, we have to help them settle and succeed as quickly as possible, and our government is doing exactly that. We’ve invested more than $900 million since 2003 to integrate newcomers into our society and economy. But we need to do more, and in a planned, strategic way. That’s why Ontario now has an immigration strategy and a proposed new Ontario Immigration Act.", "As part of this effort, we’ve been working to engage employers more closely in immigration matters and diversity. That’s because it is ultimately employers who give newcomers their first job. I believe that more employers are realizing that a diverse workplace is an advantage in today’s global economy. Our employers know what is at stake, and their interest is high in making our immigration system work better. In other words, we must make sure newcomers know that we are not starting from scratch, that the welcome mat has been out for a long time and that we are already a very diverse society.", "Speaker, it has been my pleasure to meet with Ontario employers this fall in Windsor and Oakville at an annual forum called the Minister’s Employers Table. These round tables are organized by our colleagues at the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, and I want to thank the chamber for its vision and leadership in this area. The Minister’s Employers Table sessions are a part of Ontario’s immigration strategy.", "Last year’s sessions focused on immigrant selection. They introduced employers to the federal government’s Express Entry application management system, to be implemented next year.", "This year’s sessions are focusing on labour market needs at the local level, and some key themes are already emerging from this year’s tables. Employers are telling me that immigration is fundamental to Ontario’s economic prosperity. They understand that Ontario must meet the demographic challenges of low birth rates with more immigration. One participant noted that immigration is an investment in our economic future.", "They also realize that helping newcomers succeed in the labour market is a joint government/employer responsibility. Employers understand that they have a role to play in immigrant success and want to partner more with government and other agencies in this area.", "Employers also believe that Ontario must continue to position itself as a top international destination for skilled immigrants. Simply put, success breeds success. We must build on our well-earned and well-deserved reputation as a diverse and tolerant society to attract more skilled workers. Our brand must be as a top international destination for global talent.", "Employers also stressed the importance of soft skills like language and communications to a newcomer’s overall success. While hard skills are often what initially attract employers to a job candidate, employers cite soft skills as fundamental to success on the job. Multiple participants praised existing government programs that have helped immigrants refine their occupation-related language training and skills.", "I had the chance to see the fantastic newcomers settlement programs first-hand while I was representing the ministry at the employers tables. In Windsor, I had the opportunity to tour the Centre for Skills Development and Training, the training centre in Burlington, and the Halton Multicultural Council. I also met with instructors and students at the Mason Educational Centre and the Collège Boréal campus in Windsor.", "One young woman’s story from that visit particularly stands out. This young woman arrived in Windsor 18 months ago from China. Very much like my parents and countless other immigrants, she came to Ontario in pursuit of a better life. At Collège Boréal, she is receiving settlement assistance and language training. What struck me was her excitement about being here. She told me that she loves living in Ontario and that she wants to learn to speak English so that she can begin working as soon as possible and start giving back to a place she feels has already given her so much.", "It’s because of hopeful and optimistic stories like that that our government is bringing forward Bill 49. It’s why we support the various on-the-ground agencies that help our newcomers build the soft skills that allow them to offer employers a complete package and get started on the road to success.", "In his remarks, I heard the minister say that Ontario employers, communities and our government are in the best position to decide our labour market needs in this province. What we are realizing is that there are several different labour markets in Ontario. We need to listen to employers and educators and workers and newcomers in those communities to fine-tune our immigration selection and recruitment to meet their needs.", "It is impossible for someone in Ottawa to be any closer to the ground than we are here. Here’s our issue: We have the knowledge, but we don’t always have the control to get the skilled newcomers we need and want. That’s why we need to make immigration a top priority in this Legislature, as our government is doing by introducing the Ontario Immigration Act. If passed, Ontario would be only the second province or territory in the country to have its own immigration legislation. It would also enable Ontario to welcome more highly skilled immigrants to help meet our future labour market needs.", "The legislative proposals would also strengthen our very successful immigrant selection program, the provincial nominee program, and enable it to keep Ontario growing and keep Ontario strong. Around 97% of nominees remain in Ontario. Our view is that when something is working, we need more of it, not less of it, so we’re going to maximize the value of PNP to our economy.", "The legislation would, if passed, demonstrate Ontario’s leadership in immigration and position Ontario to take advantage of proposed federal program changes in the selection of economic immigrants scheduled for early 2015. This would include increased employer participation in immigrant selection, a key concern for businesses. If passed, the legislation would respond to labour market needs by expressly allowing the minister to set immigration targets in policy for provincially selected immigrants.", "The minister talked about fraud. Bill 49 recognizes that fraud is a two-way street. The system needs to be protected against fraudulent applications, and potential newcomers need to be protected from unscrupulous operators. Bill 49 acts against both. Having a robust compliance and enforcement regime will help to protect applicants and deter abuses of their trust by predatory representatives; ensure that perpetrators of program fraud cannot profit from the system; and give Ontario’s immigration officers greater ability to catch misrepresentation and go after those who take advantage of immigrants and the system.", "We are committed to respecting the principles upon which the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act is based. We have collaborated closely with the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner regarding collection, use and disclosure of personal information under the proposed immigration legislation. We want to ensure that we strike the right balance between the need to use information we collect under our selection programs and the need to protect applicants’ privacy.", "Bill 49 is the right bill at the right time for Ontario. Most importantly, it recognizes the long history of immigration to the province and creates a framework for implementing the province’s immigration vision.", "Ontario competes with other places that are trying to create the best jobs, welcome skilled people and attract new industries. To meet this challenge, our government is creating the conditions for growth. We have competitive corporate tax rates, among the lowest in North America. We offer attractive R&D incentives, among the best in the G7. We have a workforce that’s among the most highly skilled and educated in the OECD. Yet our most valuable asset is the skills of our people.", "It is an encouraging sign for our economy that so many highly educated newcomers choose Ontario, but we need to work to ensure they can contribute to the fullest. It’s important to remember that many newcomers left home, family and friends abroad. Others had opportunities to go elsewhere. They chose us. We need to do our best for them as they integrate, find jobs and build a good life. When newcomers achieve their dreams for a better life in Ontario, their success makes life better for all Ontarians.", "Ontario has found strength in diversity. It’s who we are: a diverse and welcoming province; a dynamic, growing, sustainable, knowledge-driven economy; a place with the highest quality of life and people determined to keep making that quality of life even better. By passing Bill 49 into law, Ontario can strengthen our reputation as a place where people of all backgrounds can prosper, and we can support strong and diverse communities that nurture the best immigrants and the best citizens, because when newcomers succeed, Ontario succeeds." ],

My grandfather immigrated to Canada in the late 1940s from post-World War II Germany. At that time, he applied to come to Canada because he knew—or he had heard—that jobs were available here, that there was an opportunity for him to build a life for himself and his family. In fact, he came by himself and spent two years living here before my grandmother was able to join him with her children, my mother.", "When he was applying, they asked a number of questions, and some of the questions that my grandfather told me that they asked him were pretty basic things. They asked things like, “Can you work? Are you healthy? Are you strong? Can you do manual labour?” Those are the kinds of questions that were being asked at the time. And when my grandfather came, sure enough, he applied those skills; he applied that willingness to work and that motivation to some very, very labour-intensive work. He worked for Ontario Hydro building some of the hydro power lines that we have in our province. He eventually was able to get a job at Canada Post and worked for Canada Post for many years before retiring.", "The reason I think this story is important is because, like so many immigrants, he came to this country believing that there was opportunity here—knowing that there was opportunity here. Canada facilitated that opportunity by making sure that they were attracting the kinds of people that Canada needed to make this country great. We need to continue to do that, and I think that what this bill does is it helps to ensure that we will continue to do that. We, of course, need the help of our federal partners, the federal government, but I think it takes important steps to make sure that we can do a better job of doing that.", "Since my grandfather’s day of immigrating to Canada, the global economy has changed. The nature of the labour market has changed; it has become more global. When I think of the immigrants of today—recently I met someone who is working as a doctor for my GP who came to Canada from the Soviet Union and who had full medical qualifications. She spent a tremendous number of years and effort trying to gain medical qualification here in Ontario. Initially, when she came, she thought that process would be much easier. Unfortunately, it took her many, many years. The unfortunate part is that she discovered this only upon arriving in Canada." ],

We need to do better by those folks. They’ve come here to build this country, and they deserve better. And we deserve better. Making sure that immigrants to our country come to Canada knowing what to expect will not only ensure that they live a better quality of life—that in itself is a good reason to take these steps—but it will also ensure that we all live a better quality of life.", "When I think about our economy, we have shortages—yes, we have unemployment, and we need to tackle those issues, but we also have a lot of small businesses that are looking for workers in skilled fields, and we’re not able to fill those vacancies. There are a lot of folks from around the world who could help us do that, and we need to help make sure that happens. We all benefit from this.", "There’s a couple of things in this bill that I would like to highlight that I think are important. One is that we are going to be able, through this legislation, to accelerate the recognition of credentials for folks who are applying. That’s going to allow people who are being accepted to know faster that they’ve been accepted and allow those folks who aren’t going to be accepted to work in their fields to be declined more quickly so that they have the information before them to make a decision as to whether they want to come or not. That’s the first thing.", "The second thing is, provisions have been put into this bill to clamp down on fraud. There are so many people who come to this country with great hope and with great optimism. Unfortunately, in some cases, they are made promises by folks about services that will be offered to help them settle here, about jobs that they will get when they come here, and that never comes to fruition. This bill will allow the government to institute fines; it will allow criminal charges to be imposed on folks who abuse that trust. I think that’s critically important so that people applying to Canada, applying to come to Ontario, will have faith that they will be treated as they should be.", "I think the last thing I would just mention quickly is we need to make sure that our federal government is working with us on this. Ontario understands the local economy; we understand the local conditions here and what the labour market demands are. It’s really important that the federal government partner with us to make sure that we can better meet the demands of the labour market here.", "When my grandfather came to Canada, the system that recognized his credentials, the system that recognized his experience and what he could bring to Canada, was there to ensure that it matched the labour market needs of the day. We need to do well by those people applying to Canada today, just as we did by my grandfather. Let’s make sure that we attract the folks, that we give folks the information they need to know whether they’ll be able to work in their chosen field or not.", "We’re going to accelerate that process, and we’re going to work with our federal partners to make sure that we do well by those people who want to come to Canada and help build this country and make it better, and those people who want to come to Canada to help build this country, to make it better for all of us in all 107 ridings around this province.", "I think this is an important bill. It takes important steps to make sure we accelerate the recognition of credentials, that we clamp down on fraud and that we work even more effectively with our federal partners to make sure that we attract the kinds of folks who can build this country and do well by them. I hope we can enjoy the support of members from across the aisle as well." ],

The speakers have talked about the economic influence, and obviously that’s an important one, but we have to always consider how we’re going to create the right balance.", "I recognized in the remarks a moment ago the fact that we have people without jobs and jobs without people. When we have that kind of data available to us, I think it just makes it that much more important to understand the mechanics of immigration and the kinds of benefits, both for the community at large but also the people coming.", "One of the things that I’ve always felt was most unfortunate was some kind of message that people would get in their own home country: “You can be this when you come to Canada,” and they discover that, no, they can’t." ],

But I was able to obtain a couple of highlights of some of the things she’s going to chat about. One thing I’m particularly interested in looking into, and what her remarks are going to be on, is the provincial nominee program and how that’s working—how that’s working now, and then comparing it to the kinds of changes that are in this bill that are, hopefully, going to make it better and improve it.", "As the member from York Simcoe said, managing the expectations of someone who wants to come to another country, whether it’s Canada or Ontario or another province, is something that has to be very thoughtful and streamlined, because we don’t want to have that reputation of asking people to come, and then they arrive and, sure enough, it’s not what they signed up for. Then, you know, they could feel trapped here, and they’ve left their home country. So there are a lot of socio-economic concerns when you apply for something and it doesn’t come out to what you expect. It’s a life-changing experience, as we’ve heard from many members.", "The other thing I want to address is the fact—and I’d like to talk about this later on if I have the opportunity— that we’re gathering information and collecting information and we’re supposed to use it appropriately. I understand they consulted with the Information and Privacy Commissioner, so that’s interesting, and I’ll make some comments on that later. But the information piece and how we’re going to use it is something of interest to myself, and I’ll pursue that later on. Thank you." ],

Someone said to me once, and I think it’s very true for virtually all of us, that we are all immigrants to this place. We all have immigrant stories. My own story starts on my father’s side, with my grandparents leaving England after World War I, when there wasn’t much opportunity for them. They had a brother here in Canada who suggested that this was the land of milk and honey. They sold everything, bought passage, shipped everything they owned here, brought their children here and landed just in time for the Great Depression of 1929.", "There was no social safety net in those days, and a job that had been promised to my grandfather as supervisor of maintenance for TTC, of course, had disappeared. So the first 10 years for them was very difficult. I grew up listening to the stories of my grandparents talking about how hard it was to be an immigrant to this great country but also how glad they were that they stuck it out and stayed, because it gave their children and their grandchildren a fantastic opportunity to grow and to thrive.", "Of course, coming from Aurora myself, we have one of the greatest, I think, successful immigrant stories in the form of Frank Stronach, who founded Magna International. The headquarters is still in Aurora, providing a lot of wealth and a lot of jobs for people in Canada.", "I’m very excited by Bill 49. I think, from a high level, just the fact that the vision and the objectives that it will set, if passed, for immigration to Ontario is very, very important for the success of people coming to this great province.

It can’t be reinforced enough that it’s not up to us to have speedy or slow approvals of legislation. The government House leader—that would be the Liberal House leader—chooses which items we are going to debate in this chamber. It is the Liberal House leader who puts forward the motions for closures. So whether or not a speedy passage can occur with Bill 49 very much depends on the individual who sits at the corner of your front bench.", "I will be speaking very briefly later on to the Ontario Immigration Act and will cover off some of the points that we would like to make sure are part of the public debate that must occur when we have new pieces of legislation coming forward. But I think it was important for clarity to remind people that it is not a matter for the opposition to hold up or in fact speed up legislation through this legislative chamber; that lies solely and wholly with the government members and most particularly the House leader.

The other one will be coming up, maybe, another day, but that one is quite a bit tougher than the one I mentioned.", "Anyhow, I think Bill 49—again, allow me to repeat that it’s going to do three things over there. One is to strengthen the communication between Ontario and the federal government. I think this is critically important because they are the ones who actually assess people, the incoming, and also outgoing as well. Strengthening that communication relationship, a line that we can talk, I think is very, very important. Also, the streams of immigrants coming over here, too, the skilled workers: Definitely, we need those skilled workers, but perhaps lower-skilled or unskilled workers we should be looking into, too, because I keep hearing other provinces, like Alberta, perhaps Saskatchewan—they talk about the lower-skilled workers as well. So those are the communications that we should really strengthen and get the input back to the federal government.", "I see the clock is running out, so I’m going to sit down here and continue the debate." ],

This bill is actually a reintroduction in the Ontario Legislature. It was previously called Bill 161 and was introduced by the current Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport and minister responsible for the 2015 Pan and Parapan American Games. Bill 161, of course, died on the order paper when the government called the election in June.", "I want to highlight the fact that our federal counterparts have made multiple extensive changes to the immigration system here in Canada over the last decade, including the Federal Skilled Worker Program and the provincial nominee program, to name two. In addition, our federal counterparts plan to introduce the expression-of-interest immigration reforms to make the immigration system more responsive to labour market demands. The EOI or expression of interest “will provide governments and Canadian employers access to skilled foreign workers and expedite their entry into Canada for jobs that aren’t being filled by people already” living “in Canada.” The EOI will also “complement the provincial nominee program which will continue to be a key mechanism to allow provinces, territories, and employers to meet regional labour market needs. Almost 41,000 provincial nominees (including their spouses and dependants) were admitted to Canada through the PNP in 2012, up from approximately 3,500 in 2006.”", "The provincial nominee program, as stated on the ministry’s website, is “an immigration program through which Ontario nominates individuals and their families for permanent resident status based on a pre-approved job offer in the province.” I think this is important to mention because of its integral role in our immigration policy.", "It’s also important to talk about the immigration policy of other jurisdictions. Of course, the most obvious and cited example is Quebec’s immigration policy. As a result of the 1991 Canada-Quebec Accord, Quebec fully assumed responsibility for establishing immigration levels and for the selection and integration of immigrants. In areas under its responsibility, Quebec develops its own policies and programs, legislates, regulates and sets its own standards.", "In contrast, Ontario’s immigration policy is tied to that of the federal government. Media focus has been on Ontario taking a Quebec-style approach to immigration.", "I want to mention some important statistics about immigration in our province and other jurisdictions. The federal government recently released immigration stats for last year. What they also provided was a table of statistics from 2004 through to and including 2013 on the amount of permanent residents in each province and territory.", "There are three categories that make up the definition of a permanent resident. Permanent residents are based on foreign nationals sponsored by close relatives or family members in Canada, and include spouses and partners, dependent children, parents and grandparents. Permanent residents are also based on economic immigrants, who are people selected for their skills and ability to contribute to Canada’s economy, including skilled workers, business immigrants, provincial and territorial nominees and live-in caregivers. In addition, permanent residents are based on refugees, which include government-assisted refugees, privately sponsored refugees, refugees landed in Canada and dependants of refugees landed in Canada who were living abroad.", "The number of permanent residents is quite startling. Newfoundland and Labrador saw their permanent resident number nearly double from 2004 to 2013. Prince Edward Island’s permanent resident number tripled. Nova Scotia’s increased by almost 1,000. New Brunswick’s increased by more than 1,000. Quebec’s number increased during the same time frame. Manitoba’s almost doubled. Saskatchewan’s number increased from roughly 1,000 to 10,000 during the same time frame.", "Only two provinces’ permanent resident numbers decreased. They are British Columbia and right here in Ontario. I don’t think it takes too much to make a connection between the economy of Ontario currently and in the last number of years compared to other parts of Canada. In the time from 2004 to 2013, Ontario has lost 25,000 permanent residents.", "Interjections." ],

  "text" : [ "Perhaps the minister needs to listen more and talk less.", "What is also sad is the fact that in the breakdown of regions within our province, only four regions saw increases in their permanent resident numbers. This is quite sad.", "If we are to further break down these statistics, things get even more dire. If we are to just look at how many of those permanent residents are economic immigrants, which this bill focuses on, the numbers get worse. For example, the number of economic immigrants in Ontario in 2004 was 67,602. In 2013, that number significantly declined: It was 47,623. That’s a 20,000-person drop. I consider that disappointing to say the least.", "Let’s compare these numbers to the western provinces where we continue hearing stories about them taking away our Ontario-trained skilled workers. Manitoba, in 2003, had 4,999 economic immigrants; that number grew to 9,602 in 2013. That means it almost doubled, for those who can’t do the numbers. Saskatchewan had a meagre 883 economic immigrants in 2004. In 2013, they had a whopping total of 8,812. That is an astonishing increase for Saskatchewan. In 2004, Alberta had 8,742 economic immigrants. In 2013, they had 22,645 economic immigrants.", "There’s another interesting statistic. TD Economics performed a study looking into interprovincial migration. This bill is obviously referencing immigration from outside Canada into Canada, but I think this stat paints more of a complete picture. TD Economics performed a study looking into interprovincial migration, and guess what? Ontario lost roughly 18,000 individuals to other provinces in 2012. Alberta gained roughly 47,000 individuals from other provinces. Saskatchewan gained another 2,500 individuals from other provinces. The proof is in the pudding. Economics absolutely plays a crucial part in why these two provinces have gained so many individuals from other provinces across Canada.", "The study by TD Economics states, “Drawing Canadians to their province is not a new phenomenon for these two prairie provinces. Saskatchewan has been a net beneficiary from interprovincial flows since 2007, while Alberta has not experienced a net loss since 1994. Both provinces have posted the strongest recovery since the recession and exhibit the tightest labour markets, so it is no surprise that they demonstrate the strongest lure for other Canadians. The unemployment rates in these provinces are the lowest in Canada and act a signal to potential entrance to their labour force. Further, real per capita incomes are higher in both provinces relative to the rest of Canada.”", "The study’s sum-up of these two provinces was, “Alberta and Saskatchewan are likely to continue to lead the pack in terms of net inflows of migrants across Canada and within Canada, as both resource-rich provincial economies are expected to outperform the rest of Canada.”", "This government cannot continue to ignore the importance of having a strong economy. In 2012, the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants produced a survey on the services aiding immigrants in Ontario. In it, there are some facts that bear out what we’ve been discussing here. Some 80% of new Canadians in Ontario stay in their first city of residence. However, of the 20% who relocate from their first city of residence, the largest percentage do so because they’re seeking better employment opportunities—not a surprise to you, I’m sure, Speaker.", "I think the numbers speak for themselves. Here in Ontario, the opportunities simply don’t exist that once did. Our attraction to immigrants and migrants and our economic success are linked together, whether you like it or not.", "If we want to stop our population from leaving our province, then we must return to being the economic engine of Canada. But as long as our economy is controlled by a government that is not keeping its eye on the ball, I have little confidence that we will ever return to our once-proud status as the economic engine of Canada.", "When we were prosperous, not so long ago, we were attracting more new Canadians to Ontario. The finance minister’s own numbers bear this out. From 1997 until approximately 2002, this province experienced one of the greatest booms in immigration that we’ve seen in the last 40 years. It also happened to coincide with one of the greatest periods of economic prosperity this province has seen in that same time frame. It was a time when the Progressive Conservative government created a million jobs in Ontario. No wonder we continue to hear stories of individuals leaving our province to go west.", "The worst part of it is it’s skilled young workers who are leaving our province. As noted in the study when they say that “migrants tend to be younger, well-educated and highly skilled,” we’re losing the cream of the crop, Speaker.", "I also want to mention one more interesting finding from the TD Economics study. They said, “As populations permanently move to different regions, their tax revenues that follow them can be counted on to bolster their new government coffers.”", "The reason I wanted to mention this is because, as we heard during the recent fall economic statement this fall, this government reported that their revenue projections were off by half a billion dollars and resulted in lower projections for the next three years. I’m not saying that this is the reason for this massive miscalculation. But I do think it is something worth looking at more closely.", "This government has mismanaged our province’s immigration policy for a decade, when it could have been working with the federal government to ensure Ontario’s economic needs were met by new Canadians.", "In regard to the provincial nominee program in Ontario, many of Ontario’s nominees leave Ontario for the western provinces after a number of years because of Ontario’s poor economic climate. As a result, Ontario’s allotment of spots remains stuck at 2,500, whereas Alberta and Saskatchewan have 5,000 spots available.", "Minister, if the truth hurts, you’d better listen to it.", "The government has brought forward this legislation because the federal government forced their hand with the introduction of the 2015 expression-of-interest policy.", "Let’s take a moment to discuss what this bill will do.", "Bill 49 will allow the Lieutenant Governor in Council, through regulation, to create a registry for employers to select foreign nationals who have been selected for a selection process. We’re back to that old “by regulation” trick again, where we won’t be participating in any kind of public debate or discussion on which employers, which parts of the economy, need the assistance and will benefit from new immigration.", "An employer who wants to participate in a selection program must sign up for the newly created registry, unless stated in the regulations.", "The minister may establish a fee for employers to pay to sign up and participate in the newly created registry and selection process.", "This part of the bill provides the minister with the power to use any information provided by the employer, given to the registry, to be used as deemed fit by the minister.", "I want to say, Speaker, at this point, that I always get concerned when it’s governments picking and choosing. Historically—and I’m not picking on any political affiliation of a government—when governments get involved in picking and choosing who gets the additional immigration employees, we don’t do a very good job of it. It’s actually not our responsibility. When we try to do that, we can get caught.", "The minister is also granted the power to distribute the information provided by the registered employers to other provinces, territories and the federal government, if it is deemed fit by the minister.", "We’re giving a lot of power to one person.", "The minister will also establish the conditions to sign up to the registry. The minister can also cancel the registration of an employer if the minister believes it gives incorrect information or does not comply with the conditions of the registry. The minister only has to provide a written letter to the employer of the cancellation. Where is the right of appeal there, Speaker?", "This part of the bill was created to make the province compliant with the federal government’s 2015 expression-of-interest policy. In addition, it is also in keeping with the recommendation made by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce to enable employers and immigration consultants to navigate the EOI system.", "Another important part of Bill 49 is that it will establish a provincial immigration selection process, in keeping with the development of the 2015 expression-of-interest regulations.", "This part of the bill acknowledges that this program can only take effect through an agreement with the federal government, as stated in the federal legislation, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which authorizes the provincial government to create and/or continue a selection program. There are similar agreements in existence in provinces like Manitoba and British Columbia, while no such agreement currently exists in Ontario. As no agreement exists with the federal government, this provision is largely in anticipation of the federal government’s new immigration strategy in 2015. A selection program cannot exist if it is not authorized by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.", "Another part of Bill 49 will create enforcement and compliance officers, to ensure employers and international job recruits are not providing false information. They will be able to access fines and penalties. This part of the bill is for fraud prevention purposes.", "The ministry has suggested—sorry, Speaker. You look like you’re going to stop me." ],

Today there are 1,181 missing and murdered aboriginal women in this country. We know that last year, too many women in Ontario lost their lives as a result of gender-based violence. They, too, must be remembered.", "In recent weeks, violence against women has dominated media and public conversation, but this is not a recent issue. It’s a long-standing one, and it crosses all cultures, classes and sectors. While progress is being made, transforming entrenched attitudes and behaviours takes time. Together we must recognize the inequality that women face and take action against it.", "Gender-based violence takes place in homes, schools, workplaces, and across communities. It comes in many forms: physical, sexual and psychological. These are all preventable, and they must stop, with our collective commitment.", "It’s estimated that one in three Canadian women will experience sexual assault in their lifetime, and nearly half of Canadians know at least one woman who has been sexually or physically assaulted.

We must challenge the social norms that perpetuate this silence, and provide appropriate support to victims.", "In Ontario, we are focused on working with our community partners and other government ministries to end violence against women. Over the past three decades, the Ontario Women’s Directorate has played, and continues to play, an important role in effecting and influencing positive change for women’s equality here in Ontario.", "We have implemented many initiatives under our domestic violence and sexual violence action plans to prevent violence against women and strengthen support for victims. This includes public education campaigns in diverse communities across Ontario, which equip those closest to a woman with the skills to identify the signs of violence and to intervene effectively. We have also trained over 37,000 front-line professionals and service providers to detect domestic and sexual violence and to support those victims.", "As we mourn the loss of all women lost to violence, I challenge all of us to take action against violence against women and inequality in our own communities.

They were full of promise, preparing for interesting, challenging careers. Like previous generations of women, they were poised to make a difference in what had previously been a male-dominated profession. Tragically, these 14 young women were killed because they were women.", "It is an occasion to remember the women murdered, and it’s important for all of us to recommit to ensuring that their deaths were not in vain. As we mourn the loss of the students at École Polytechnique, it is important for us to be mindful that many women and girls have been murdered or abused since then. We know the majority of men do not use or condone violence, but most of the violence in Canada is committed by men.", "The statistics are alarming. Statistics Canada reports that women are three times more likely than men to be killed, sexually assaulted or threatened with a weapon by a male partner. According to YWCA Canada, there are 460,000 sexual assaults in Canada every year. Only 33 of every 1,000 sexual assault cases are reported to the police, and 29 are recorded as a crime. These numbers speak volumes about how many assailants walk free and why women may be afraid to press charges against their abusers.", "Violence against women continues to be part of our present, as we have seen throughout the media in the past several weeks. Because of these high-profile cases, we’ve all been forced to confront an ugly elephant in the room that has been ignored for far too long. Sexual harassment and assault is not an isolated occurrence. It’s not something that only affects vulnerable women. It affects all of us. It’s time that we acknowledge this fact and find a way to deal with it.", "It is encouraging when more victims of sexual assault are finding the strength to speak up and share their experience. Each person who comes forward to tell their story is lending their voice to those victims still silenced and tormented by such abuse. We need to continue to work to end violence against women and girls as part of our commitment to women’s equality. It’s important for all of us in this chamber, as policy-makers and community members, to participate in the critical work of creating a society where domestic violence is no longer viewed as an inevitable social ill.

We need to encourage that volunteerism, because we’re not all the same. Every one of our communities has special festivals and special programs in place.

For those who are employed, too often the violence follows them to their workplaces. For aboriginal women, the reality of violence is much higher, with almost 1,200 aboriginal women murdered or missing in Canada.", "For too long, this Liberal government has ignored recommendations on how to prevent intimate partner homicides. It has relied on a piecemeal, project-based approach to domestic violence and sexual assault, instead of advancing a comprehensive and integrated violence prevention strategy that recognizes ending violence against women as an economic and social justice imperative; a shared priority for every ministry, every sector, every community and every citizen in Ontario.", "Twenty-five years later, on this December 6, let us commit to real change that will finally put an end to the scourge of violence against women." ],

I have made sure to speak with some of my colleagues here at Queen’s Park and have come to realize that these concerns are common across the province primarily, as I have said, in rural areas.", "For those unfamiliar with commercial fill, it is often referred to as excess soil that has been excavated predominantly from construction sites in urban areas. If there is no room on the current site for storing the soil, or if it has no functional use, the fill is relocated. These relocation sites can be pits, former quarries, farms or other designated areas. This process is accomplished with the use of large trucks; in some cases, hundreds per day, depending on the amount of fill, across rural highways and roads.", "Residents of rural communities are also sometimes offered the fill for their own private lands, as a way of adding to landscaping and levelling out of their properties. I begin to see an issue with this process when the fill has not been tested properly for contaminants and dangerous chemicals. Residents are concerned that gasoline, heavy metals, hydrocarbons and other pollutants can come saturated in the fill and end up unnecessarily at distant fill sites, seemingly without forewarning. This poses a risk for those who come in contact with the fill, especially in instances where it has been offered to a private landowner with a home or a farm.", "The risk is especially pronounced when we can see the impact that these pollutants could have on our water. Rural Ontarians rely heavily on groundwater for their wells and irrigation. The pollution of such a necessary commodity would have a significant impact on our communities. These transplanted chemicals have the potential to leak into the water table, which affects not only those in the vicinity but those in a much greater area who may share the common watershed.", "Without proper testing, it is possible that landowners will find out too late that the fill they have received has been contaminated. A concern arises before the contaminants are dealt with. A labour-intensive process begins to test and remove the fill as necessary, and an appropriate place for disposal must be found. As it stands, residents have to rely on the word of the company moving the soil that it is safe, and municipalities, given fiscal and other resource constraints, are simply not equipped to alleviate these concerns.", "While some municipalities have bylaws in place, such as site-alteration bylaws, to regulate what can and can’t be added to sites within their borders, most do not have either the resources or staff necessary to monitor the practice. I do not feel they have the jurisdiction to ensure that what is being brought into their area is not tainted.", "Unfortunately, several examples of concerns around commercial fill come from my own riding across all three municipalities that I represent. One of them comes from Newcastle in Clarington at a fill site known as Morgans Road. From 2010 to 2012, hundreds of trucks drove through Newcastle on their way to a dump site off Highway 2.", "To the knowledge of the residents, there had been no warning that a fill operation would begin. The residents were subjected to the noise and dust brought by these trucks and the discomfort of not knowing the origin or nature of the fill. They worked with their local municipal councillors, their government representatives and the Ministry of the Environment to learn more about the situation, and testing that was done on the soil.", "When a portion of it was found to have exceedingly high levels of contaminants, the re-excavation of some of the fill began, and the residents of the area were again subjected to the process in reverse. This occurred several times, with the new fill added and removed after being tested, and the residents have expressed to me that they still do not feel that they have a full understanding of the status of the fill now in their community.", "Another example comes from Greenbank in Scugog. The Greenbank Airport is a small grass airport just northwest of Port Perry. Over the last several years, hundreds of truckloads of fill have been sent through Scugog and neighbouring municipalities to a location that was initially nondescript—to the residents in the area, it appeared simply to be a fill site. Then, however, it was announced by the federal government that the construction of an aerodrome was to eventually begin and that the fill was necessary to prepare the site. However, the fill in question had failed inspection standards on at least two occasions before this announcement, but the residents of Scugog were now told that the matter was under federal jurisdiction. Reports of trucks onto the site still abound while there seems to be no ongoing construction of an aerodrome.", "I share the concerns of my constituents that the fill being used in this site needs to be properly tested within the proper jurisdiction but that we need to work together to ensure that jurisdiction is properly established and clearly laid out and that the sustainability and environmental integrity of this area and all areas in Ontario are protected.", "I would like to commend the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change for its ongoing work in this area. The Management of Excess Soil guide is a step in the right direction. It has a lot of great pieces and clearly lays out ways in which brown fill and soil must be transported, regulated and evaluated. The minister has made it clear to me that there are intentions in place to deal with these situations and that his staff is working diligently on a plan.", "I am bringing this motion before the House because a lot of work is still to be done on ensuring that soil is tested properly, that the specificity of commercial fill is managed within this plan and that we work side by side with our municipal partners, both rural and urban, and our federal partners to ensure that our precious water resources remain protected, and that those who rely on them—that is, all Ontarians—can rely on that resource to be protected.", "It is my intention, by raising this today, to shed some light on the need for our government and the appropriate ministries, as well as municipalities, to ensure that we take a hard look at how we manage the environmental integrity of the landfill that is being brought to these communities.", "Our current strategy on sustainability that is coming from the ministry is admirable and covers very important issues. There are implications for certain oversights here that extend beyond commercial fill alone, but if we work together, we can create some efficiencies to ensure that we are all on the same page so that tainted fill is not ending up in our communities.", "This is a complex, multi-faceted issue that will take some time to address, but my intent is to keep it at the attention of all parties so that we can start working together to promote the safety of all Ontarians." ],

It’s a very difficult question to find a way to respond, because there are designated landfills, there are processes that are in place, but there are too many opportunities for getting around those rules and regulations. Some of them are the problems of the lack of oversight. Some of them are the fact that people in the neighbourhood look the other way. “It isn’t quite in my backyard, so I don’t think I want to do anything at this point.” So there are all kinds of reasons why this simply gets left to percolate that much more.", "The other problem is a practical one.

He really could.", "The NDP agrees with the member from Durham that there should be a comprehensive regulation on the disposal of commercial fill. We’ve actually agreed with this for a long time, and so it’s good that you’ve brought it back.", "The government has done, quite honestly, an abysmal job at regulating soil disposal, so there’s room for improvement. Obviously, because this is a long-standing issue, Ontarians have been at risk of exposure to contaminated soil. This is a problem; there are solutions. We look forward to the passing of this motion and then action on this issue.", "For quite some time, the government has lagged on the issue of safe disposal of commercial fill. There is little government oversight with respect to where soil is disposed of. There is inadequate oversight of private contractors and what they do with the excavated soil. There is no clear definition of clean soil. There is no tracking system for the soil. There are few rules about where soil can be dumped. Private developers, you may be interested to know, are allowed to hire so-called “qualified persons” to test the soil they plan to dispose of, but there is no regulation of the plans for disposal, and the government only steps in if something goes wrong.", "Obviously this is not a sustainable plan. This is an inadequate plan, because contaminant tests are not always immediately accurate, so we oftentimes end up picking up the pieces after the fact. We do need, in the province of Ontario, a proactive plan to deal with contaminated soil instead of a reactive one. Quite honestly, this is actually an emerging theme here at Queen’s Park. It is not appropriate to wait until something goes wrong to deal with potentially harmful soil.", "For some time now, municipalities have actually been attempting to pick up the slack in regulation of soil disposal, but they cannot regulate the disposal of commercial fill that crosses municipal borders. That is why a provincial regulation is actually needed. Toxic soil is being spread on otherwise good farmland because there isn’t adequate regulation of where it can be disposed of.", "According to the Residential and Civil Construction Alliance of Ontario, there are 50 million tonnes of dirt excavated in Ontario construction projects in peak construction years, at a cost of $1.7 billion. I think we should all acknowledge that this motion from the member for Durham is quite timely, because there is more excavated soil than ever before, due to the Pan Am Games, and more contaminated soil than any other project before.", "Once again, the Residential and Civil Construction Alliance of Ontario says that about 7.5 million tonnes of dirt is contaminated and should be going to approved landfills and sites. Because of a lack of regulation, it is wholly unclear how much of this contaminated soil is actually going to proper landfills. The government obviously does not have a clear picture right now about where the contaminated soil is going, but clearly much of it does not end up in approved sites. Contaminated soil has been dumped on prime farmland in Ontario.", "I think it’s always helpful to peel back the layers of an issue like this and tell you how it’s actually affecting regular people in the province of Ontario. It’s true that when contaminated soil is dumped on unapproved sites, this is often discovered accidentally.", "This case is from the Toronto Star: Sheep farmers Ruco and Kimberly Braat found “polyaromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals like barium, cadmium, copper and lead” in supposedly clean soil delivered by a company called Green For Life. The Braats say that 700 truckloads were dumped on their land. They’ve had to sell almost 100 of their 450 sheep to pay for legal costs.", "Green For Life—the private garbage collector for the city of Toronto; also of interest—has said they are not to blame, and that it is the fault of their so-called “qualified person.” That’s another missing part of the oversight, if you will, and the enforcement. The Ministry of the Environment charged GFL and a soil broker called Earthworx, and it is currently in front of the courts—something we hear a lot about here at Queen’s Park.", "Toxic soil can obviously impact our food and drinking water. Carmela Marshall, of Lakeridge Citizens for Clean Water, said to the Toronto Star, “How many years before it gets in our groundwater? Five years? People are afraid.” As development happens, as big, major mega-projects like the Pan Am Games happen, soil obviously needs to be placed elsewhere across the province, and in many jurisdictions the aquifers are becoming more and more stressed. In Waterloo region, our aquifer in certain parts does not have the integrity it once had. This is something we have to be cognizant of.", "There is a list of recommendations that I hope can actually help with the issue of disposal, if this motion goes forward—I suspect that it will, because it should—can actually help with the issue of disposal:", "—Requirements for testing of excavated fill at specific minimum frequencies: That needs to happen.", "—Documentation of where all excavated soils are transported must be included in the record of site condition.", "—Qualified persons—actually, really qualified persons—must sign off on the quality and the quantity of the soil excavated and removed from the brownfield site.", "—Documentation from the receiving site indicating acceptance of the soils must also be included.", "The city of Toronto recommended to the government that they should “enact regulations to ensure that excess soil placement is provincially regulated in a manner that is consistent across the province and in accordance with the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act.”", "The RCCAO has also recommended a more complete strategy for the disposal of contaminated soil. They recommended “that the province establish a pragmatic, risk-based and affordable framework that distinguishes excess construction soils, particularly those from municipal roads and rights of way, from historic industrial hazardous wastes which are the primary focus of laws such as Ontario regulation 153/04.”", "The Ministry of the Environment has a guideline of best practices, as the member from Durham will know, for disposal, but they are generally unenforceable. This is the missing link.", "More excavated soil, obviously, is moving around the province. It should be of note for the people of this House that TO2015 has hired Green for Life to dispose of 200,000 tonnes of contaminated soil to an approved landfill, but so far only an eighth has made it. It is unclear where the rest of the soil has ended up, and even Green for Life, the company, is not sure.", "There are obviously environmental consequences for not having the appropriate enforcement, for not having the appropriate oversight, to ensure that contaminated soil is placed safely in an approved site. I think that many environmental groups agree that the government is not doing a good enough job with respect to contaminated soil. The NDP agrees. For the protection of Ontarians and Ontario’s farmlands, we must do better and we should do better, but the missing piece is the oversight and the enforcement.", "I look forward to listening to more of the debate on this important issue." ],

I’d like to thank the member from Durham for bringing forth this motion and shedding light on a topic that can affect us all, Mr. Speaker.", "This issue is rarely talked about, but it is a conversation that is worth having. Sometimes, as we all know, simply raising awareness about a problem can help, in itself, to find a solution.", "The problem of commercial fill being dumped onto rural properties has the potential to cause significant environmental and ecological damage. I think the members opposite have noted that. We must make sure that we do everything possible to minimize its inherent risks. Ensuring that hazardous or toxic soil does not get redistributed to other areas is something that I think we can all agree with. Collecting data and forming a strategy to deal with the issue is an important step and safeguard.", "As parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, I understand, perhaps in a particular way, how much it is our responsibility as parliamentarians to protect and maintain the environment for future generations, and it is a responsibility that this government takes very seriously.", "Most people probably don’t think about or even realize that the soil and other matter that is removed during construction and development needs to be relocated. It is a practice that is taken for granted. The reality, however, is that this material is often transported long distances and has the potential to contain many harmful or hazardous components in addition to just soil.", "Large urban municipalities are most often unable to accommodate the volume of commercial fill produced within their boundaries, so the burden falls upon nearby rural communities. By collecting and analyzing the data on these types of transactions, we can help both sides better understand the risks and the benefits. Clean fill is something that could be used in many applications for the benefit of a community, such as helping in the rehabilitation of exhausted aggregate resource sites, so we should encourage them to use it to their advantage.", "Developers may not even be aware of the potential hazards contained within the soil they remove, so we must help them understand and manage these situations when they occur, which they invariably will. Without careful observation and management, this issue has the potential to become very serious, and it is something that many municipalities are facing already, including my community, the city of Burlington.", "Many communities that contain valuable agricultural land are finding themselves faced with difficult choices. Farmers who are having trouble making ends meet are offered money to accept soil dumped on their property, an offer that they sometimes find difficult to refuse. These individuals, these farmers, often do not know where this fill is coming from or what it may contain. They do not have the resources or knowledge to have this material tested, and so something must be done to ensure that they are not putting themselves or others at risk of serious harm.", "Agricultural land is extremely valuable, as we all know, both to the economy and to our food security. Once this land is damaged by toxins, it’s very difficult—nearly impossible, in fact—to reverse the impacts. Our province is blessed with some of the best agricultural land in the country, but we must not take that for granted. Protecting this resource is of the utmost importance, increasingly so as ensuring our food supply becomes more difficult, and removing risk factors like contaminated soil will play a key role.", "This motion will take some important steps towards mitigating these risks and help to safeguard communities and families in areas where this is becoming a problem. Food security is becoming an ever more important issue, so we must make sure that our farmland is protected in every way possible. The agricultural and agri-food sector is a significant contributor to the economy of Ontario, and harming it in any way would be irresponsible.", "The dumping of commercial fill can have other impacts on the economy too. Residents exposed to hazardous material could become ill and unable to work, reducing their positive impact on their local economy and potentially putting additional stresses, Speaker, on our health care system. There can also be significant costs associated with cleanup once contaminated soil is dumped in a location.", "These types of operations, in addition to their costs, can take extensive amounts of time to complete, and are often unable to turn the land back to its original state. We simply cannot afford to put Ontario’s economy at risk by allowing commercial fill to be dumped anywhere, without first taking into account all of the risk factors and doing what we can to reduce them as much as possible.", "Polluted soil can also have effects on wildlife, threatening the habitat and health of species in a given area. Consideration must be given as a priority to protect their well-being when we think about dumping potentially harmful material. Flora and fauna are often very sensitive to the environment around them, and subtle changes can have serious and lasting effects. Introducing foreign toxins into these habitats can decimate populations of birds, mammals, aquatic life and even insects.", "Ecosystems maintain a careful balance, and disturbing a single species can have a ripple effect that is felt throughout. This is especially true of species at risk and endangered species, which already face mounting pressures from every corner of society. Adding additional stress could be what pushes them over the brink into extinction, a possibility which is all too real and one which is clearly unacceptable. Creating a plan that will take the safety of local residents into account will have the added effect of protecting the habitat of local wildlife, helping to ensure their survival and removing pressure from those species most at risk.", "In addition, watersheds and local groundwater are relied upon heavily by residents of all areas, but those in rural communities are often the most sensitive. Even small amounts of pollutants introduced into a system can have long-lasting, pervasive and devastating effects on residents in the area, including health problems and negative economic impacts.", "Beyond the impact to people in these areas, watershed issues can also adversely impact wildlife, including endangered species, as I mentioned, and add further pressure to already weakened and declining populations. Water, like food security, is something that we must do everything within our power to protect.", "For the reasons I’ve cited, and so many more, I would like again to thank the member from Durham for bringing this very important issue to light and helping us to ensure that we protect our environment for generations to come. Our government is committed to protecting the health and well-being of all Ontarians. Initiatives like this will make a positive contribution to that commitment. I would encourage all members of this House to support this motion, given its potential to safeguard our environment, our watersheds, our food security and our economy." ],

This is not a new issue, and as you know, it has been raised in the House many times before.", "Since 2011, my colleague John O’Toole did a wonderful job standing up and representing his particular riding on this issue. I’d like to also give a nod and my appreciation to the member from Wellington–Halton Hills. He has done an outstanding job representing his concerned citizens on this issue as well. You couple their initiatives, dating back to 2011, that this government ignored, turned a blind eye to and voted down—all of their actions were captured by the media, dating back to 2011, 2013, and again this year.", "If this government was truly interested in addressing this issue, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change and the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing should be working together to table meaningful legislation, as opposed to just the nudge that this particular initiative represents.", "Again, I commend the member from Wellington–Halton Hills. He arranged a meeting with the Environmental Commissioner, Gord Miller, to allow his concerned citizens to further explore what their options are as they see compromised soil, which very well could be contaminated, coming in truckloads, literally, to their community around the Erin area.", "What we find on the order paper today—really and truly, when you peel away the layers—is just a recommendation. It’s a recommendation that the government should compile relevant data. Well, Speaker, I suggest to you, based on the real-life examples we’ve seen and read about in the news recently, we need to be developing a strategy, as opposed to just compiling relevant data. And we have to go on from that, because we know this is a sizable issue.", "We’ve heard earlier that the RCCAO finds that, on average, 25 million cubic metres of excess soil is excavated annually from sites across Ontario. In peak construction years, up to 50 million tonnes of dirt was excavated in Ontario projects, most from the GTA region, with experts estimating 15% of that soil—as much as 7.5 million tonnes—was contaminated and en route to approved landfill or remediation sites.", "I want to talk about those remediation sites as well. It underscores the importance of having an action plan.", "My community of South Bruce undertook, in the last three years, a huge infrastructure project with water and sewers, and the soil that came into the community this past spring was compromised. People were looking forward to walking on their green grass again, and lo and behold, they were finding sharp objects in it. Up on the hill, they were literally collecting Baggies full of foreign objects out of the soil. This should not be happening in Ontario.", "We also note that the construction of the athletes’ village for the Pan Am and Parapan Am Games saw 500,000 tonnes of soil removed. And guess what, Speaker? The government, this Liberal government of the day, can only account for 134,000 tonnes. That’s unacceptable.", "Speaker, we talk about this initiative—nudging the government to compile relevant data. Well, I think it’s clear the issue already is in existence. So I encourage this government to step up and develop an action plan and meaningful legislation. I want to implore this government that we want an effective solution to this problem and provincial action across Ontario.", "If the government was really concerned about this issue, this motion would not be needed and you would instead be seeing a Liberal government spending its time putting forward legislation to fix this problem, not wasting our time and taxpayers’ time with a nudge.", "This motion does not force the minister to take any action on the issue of contaminated soil or excess soil management.", "So while, yes, I do support this motion, I believe more than just a nudge is necessary.

What makes this motion unique is it was initially proposed by a previous member for Durham, who was a Conservative. Conservatives are traditionally seen as anti-regulation, but this is a case where the Conservative Party agrees that this issue, the issue of contaminated soil, needs more regulation.", "The member from Durham—the current member from Durham—has proposed this, and I’ve heard all the Liberal members speak on this and say that this should be done. It leaves me somewhat perplexed, Speaker. It truly does. Because I’ve listened to the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, and he’s obviously—obviously—passionate about the environment. We’ve watched this government in action in this last session, and they are certainly not afraid of pushing legislation through this House—some that’s fairly egregious, in our opinion. But this stronger environmental control on contaminated soil is a no-brainer. This is something that we don’t need a motion for. The government could do this, and the Conservatives would agree with it, because they proposed it. What’s the problem?", "We all agree that this is a huge issue. It’s an old issue. I can remember when I was on the board of Dairy Farmers of Ontario, and a farmer came and he had contaminated soil on his land. He drilled a well into it. He didn’t know it was from the Ministry of Transportation. It was asphalt, and his cows died. This isn’t a new issue; it’s an old issue.", "I don’t understand why the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change doesn’t move on this today—today. It isn’t an issue for today. It was an issue a year ago, two years ago, 10 years ago. Now with the Pan Am/Parapan Games—the first time I’ve said that in the Legislature—it’s a huge issue. If this government was really concerned—if the former Minister of the Environment was really concerned, he would have moved on this, instead of talking about these motions.", "This is one where no one is going to disagree. The Conservatives are going to agree to more regulation. Look at that. And the Liberals should agree. But the Liberals have a majority.

As I said, I’m pleased to support the spirit of the motion.", "I’ve heard from my residents. On a number of occasions, I think, when I’ve been speaking in the House, I’ve talked about how important the Oak Ridges moraine is to the residents of Newmarket–Aurora. I’ll continue to speak to that, because when I knocked on doors, many, many people told me how important it is to protect the moraine, which really is the rain barrel of southern Ontario.", "You can imagine the horror that struck Aurora a few years ago—two years ago, I believe; it will be three years this spring—when an owner of a piece of vacant property proceeded to punch a laneway from Yonge Street onto the property and cut down hundreds of trees and trucked in hundreds of truckloads of soil, right on top of the Oak Ridges moraine, without permission from the region, from the municipality of Aurora or from anyone else. Our concern, as residents of the area, was about what was in the soil that was coming from wherever it came from.", "It’s an interesting observation, because a number of people from towns to the north of us—East Gwillimbury and Georgina—have talked about the impact of fill on farmland in that area and their concerns about what is contained in that soil. I know a number of them contacted us to talk about the need for regulation and the need to make sure that the soil heading north is clean. They told me that when Toronto announces a subway project, a chill runs up and down their spine because they know that that’s going to mean an awful lot of fill moving north. They just want to be sure that it is clean fill that’s being used.", "As a speaker said earlier, a lot of the time, that fill is put to good purpose. A lot of low-lying areas—under the supervision of the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority—that fill is placed appropriately. It’s clean and it’s used to enhance the viability of marginal agricultural land and to turn it into more productive land. So there is a place for clean fill to be used appropriately.", "But going back to our property in Aurora and the boldness, I think this is what is so frustrating for residents. It’s not just necessarily the proper regulation or enforcement. We had a lot of that in place in our town and in our region, and yet when officials confronted the owner of the property and ordered them to stop dumping truckloads in—they were doing it at nighttime and they were doing it on the weekend. Finally, only because a number of citizens and a certain councillor with the town of Aurora threatened to chain themselves across the laneway, the region moved in and put a tandem wheel dump truck across the illegal laneway to stop the owner of that property from dumping more soil, only to find out the next day that they had pushed it out of the way with their bulldozer and had brought in yet more soil. So the town got to play. It brought its dump trucks in and parked them. We had a security camera set up and security guards on-site.", "That’s what made everyone so angry: that even when you have rules, even when you have enforcement, if you have an industry that can act that way without getting into too much trouble—or so they thought—they will get away with it. I can say that in our neck of the woods, I believe things have ended happily. The province, the region and the town have had the soil removed, hundreds of truckloads. The land has been reshaped, topsoil put down and trees replanted. It was a lengthy process, quite frankly, and it was a real scare because we were never sure what was in all of that soil that was being dumped. We had no assistance whatsoever from the owner of the property.", "But I know things haven’t gone well to the north of us, in municipalities to the north of my riding. I think it behooves us all to take a closer look at how we regulate and how we enforce the transportation of those soils, be they clean or not so clean." ],

I think it was around two years ago that I met with a number of concerned residents in the town of Erin who brought their concerns to my attention about the fill that was coming into their area. I listened, and I investigated some of the facts. What they were telling me was correct. I wrote a letter to the Minister of the Environment of the day and urged the appointment of an inter-ministerial committee involving senior civil servants from the various ministries that have an interest in this issue, and I’ve followed up on a couple of occasions.

I’m pleased to say that the Minister of the Environment of the day, the member for St. Catharines, agreed and launched a full review of the issue. We’re now, I think, about 12 months into that review. We were told the review would take between 12 and 18 months. So again, I want to thank him.", "We also asked for the Ministry of Municipal Affairs to review the issue. Again, we believe that they have a significant part to play in terms of developing the strategy. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs chose not to launch the review, but we continue to call upon that ministry to assume some responsibility for this issue in terms of working towards a solution.", "I also want to compliment and thank our environment critic, the member for Huron–Bruce, who has taken a real keen interest in all of the issues affecting her riding, as well as those involving her critic responsibility in the time that she’s served in the Legislature.

It will institute a system of fairness and equity that currently does not exist when it comes to the problem of trespassing on private property.", "I’d first like to provide some context as to why I brought forward this bill. I’ve heard from constituents who have complained about uninvited trespassers on private property, especially on farmland. For example, I’d like to read an excerpt from correspondence I received on this issue: “Too often, farmers and farm properties are host to uninvited trespassers who hunt or ride on farm fields on ATVs, damaging crops and property, disturbing animals and even posing a threat to the farm’s biosecurity.”", "I believe that this is a fair concern to be raised in this chamber. Many of us here know farmers or have family members who own a farm. When you speak to them, they will understand the threats posed by trespassers, but even if you’re not a farmer there are still legitimate concerns regarding trespassing on private property. I don’t think anyone here would want their property that they have worked hard for and take care of to be intruded upon and potentially damaged in the process.", "Unfortunately, the Trespass to Property Act as it’s currently written does not address this issue adequately. This is the reason I’ve introduced Bill 36: to update the Trespass to Property Act to enable it to better deal with issues like this.", "To start, obviously the Trespass to Property Act prohibits the unlawful entry of a premise without the permission of the occupier. It is considered trespassing when someone enters on a premise that is prohibited under this act or engages in an activity on a premise when the activity is prohibited under the act. It is also considered trespassing if a person does not leave the premises immediately after he or she is directed to do so by the occupier of the premises or a person authorized by the occupier.", "When someone is caught and is deemed to have trespassed, the act sets out that they are liable to a fine of not more than $2,000. The problem, Speaker, is that there is no minimum fine set in the act, so often what ends up happening is that no fine, in fact, is levied at all. This ends up reinforcing the dangerous notion that anyone can trespass without repercussion.", "In addition to this issue, the Trespass to Property Act also states that if someone is convicted of trespassing and the property was damaged, the owner is entitled to sue for compensation. The problem is that in these cases the property owner may only receive a maximum compensation of $1,000. So let’s think about that for a moment: If someone trespasses, causes $10,000 worth of damage and is convicted of trespassing, the owner of the property can recoup, at a maximum, $1,000—and that’s the best-case scenario. In effect, the owner would be out of pocket for any additional damages.

Every year since, that statistic has grown. This is an issue that is clearly happening across Ontario. I think it is safe to assume that the reason why trespassing still occurs in our province, and has increased, is because the current act is insufficient in curbing trespassing.", "In its current form, the Trespass to Property Act does not go far enough in providing fair compensation for property owners, and does not send a strong message to individuals who choose to trespass. We must find a way to discourage trespassing on private property and create a system of fair compensation for individuals who experience damage on their property as a result of trespassing.", "People who trespass on farmland, for example, can end up damaging fencing, crops, livestock and other parts of the property. This can quickly add up to thousands of dollars in damages. The Ontario Federation of Agriculture has stated that more needs to be done in regard to trespassing on private property.", "I want to read another excerpt from the correspondence I’ve received from a Dufferin–Caledon constituent. It reads, “The Trespass to Property Act should be amended to protect landowners, deter unwanted visitors and compensate farmers fairly for damage.” My bill, the Respecting Private Property Act, will do just that.", "The Respecting Private Property Act will make necessary changes to the Trespass to Property Act. It will create a minimum fine of $500 for trespassing, and it will increase the maximum compensation for damages to $25,000. Increasing the limit on compensation for damages allows property owners to be fairly compensated for destruction of their property; and a minimum fine will also send a message that trespassing is a serious issue and will not be taken lightly.", "In light of my private member’s bill, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture has come out in support. I would like to read the endorsement from their vice-president, Keith Currie, into the record. I’m sure many of the members in this chamber know that the OFA has been calling for these changes for quite some time. So the initial idea came from them, and I do appreciate their support.", "“The Ontario Federation of Agriculture is proud to support Sylvia Jones MPP’s Bill 36, the Respecting Private Property Act. The OFA has been working with government and policy-makers to amend the Trespass to Property Act for many years. We need this act updated to reflect the severity of trespassing and the damages that result from thoughtless or reckless behaviour.”", "I was proud to receive this endorsement for Bill 36, because the OFA has been dealing with this issue for years with their members. They know the problem, they are familiar with the causes, and their endorsement is something that I think speaks to the effectiveness of Bill 36 in curbing the issues I’ve spoken about today.", "Dufferin–Caledon is consistently growing, and as of 2011, there are more than 40,000 private dwellings, with some areas experiencing large spikes in residential development.", "Trespassing on private property should be a concern to all of us and to anyone who owns a piece of property that they have worked hard for.", "I want to read out another piece of correspondence I received after I introduced Bill 36: “Trespassers are a big problem on my property and the police are called several times a year. No trespassing signs, or the fence stops people from entering. I have been laughed at and told trespassing is no more than a parking ticket.... Something must be done for people to take trespassing seriously. I am in 100% support of increasing the minimal fine to $500.”", "Speaker, people are powerless to stop individuals from trespassing. In addition, there is clearly little or no action being taken to prevent trespassing and hold accountable those who do it. We need to discourage trespassing. I believe this can be effectively done through the establishment of a minimum fine.", "I’ve also received an endorsement from the Peel Federation of Agriculture: “The private member’s bill regarding the increase in trespassing fine is fully supported by the directors and members of the Peel Federation of Agriculture. Since the creation of the greenbelt over 10 years ago, some of the members of the public have the misconception that greenbelt has become public property. Our members are seeing an increase in trespassing, both on foot and on motorized off-road vehicles. Crops are damaged, animals have escaped from gates left open. All the garbage left behind is left for us to clean up. There is also an increased risk in liability to our members, if injury occurs on their property. We fully support this bill, it will encourage deterrence from exposure to such cases, and we thank you for all your efforts.”", "Speaker, I believe these letters of support speak to the problems I have raised and attempted to address with Bill 36. We cannot expect property owners to foot the bill when a trespasser causes damage. It’s not fair, and it’s not right. We need to ensure there is equity in the system.", "Many of those who experience damage to their property are, in fact, farmers. When their property is damaged, it takes a toll on their livelihood. This is not right, and $1,000 in compensation doesn’t come nearly close enough when the cost of damages can potentially far exceed this. Particularly when you consider the risk of vandalism in a more urban setting, the risk of damage occurring as a result of trespass does exist, and the owner shouldn’t be responsible for footing the bill; the trespasser should be.", "We need to ask ourselves if the current fine structure is fair and equitable. That’s why I’ve brought forward Bill 36, the Respecting Private Property Act. It addresses the concerns with the current law and will establish what I believe to be a fair and equitable system.", "I sincerely hope all of my colleagues here today will vote to support Bill 36, the Respecting Private Property Act. We need to ensure that property owners are fairly compensated for destruction of their property. We need to send a signal that trespassing is a serious issue and will not be taken lightly.", "I wanted to share with you a very brief story. Many of you will be familiar with the Cheltenham Badlands. It’s a much-loved, highly sought after, day trip tourism destination that I’m sure a lot of people in this chamber have either seen pictures of or visited themselves.", "There is a friend of mine who lives very close to the Badlands. She told me a story last week that, over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, a large family was having a picnic on her front lawn. They believed that because they’d visited the Cheltenham Badlands and they were having a great afternoon in the country, they would take their picnic lunch and their portable barbecue, which they literally set up on the front lawn of this woman’s property.", "As you can imagine, she was not pleased and was extremely frustrated when she tried to explain to the trespassers that this was not public property and they were not welcome to have a family dinner on her front lawn. The response seemed to be, “We’re in the country. We’re enjoying the lovely weather, and we’re enjoying the fall colours. Why can’t you leave us alone?”", "Clearly, there needs to be a lot more education, but we also need to put in the deterrents that will prevent this kind of abuse, because there is no other word for it. Private property is, by its very nature, private property. We have to have laws and legislation in place that will deter that kind of activity, and I believe Bill 36 will do that.", "I’m going to listen with interest to the debates, and I hope I can count on support from all three sides." ],

Trespassing on private farmland can result in damage to crops, livestock, fencing and other parts of the property. Too often, farmers and landowners have no effective redress for this damage. This bill seeks to change that.", "I know that the Ontario Federation of Agriculture has been strongly supportive of this bill, and I fully understand why. At present, the courts may impose a fine of up to $2,000 for trespassing. The bill before us proposes to impose a minimum fine of $500 where there is currently none and, therefore, instruct the courts to impose a fine of between $500 and $2,000 for the offence of trespassing on private property.", "I’m supportive of the rights of landowners against trespassers, and I’m also supportive of some level of minimum fine. The objective of this bill to increase the limit for court-ordered compensation is a very worthy one and, in my opinion, the most important aspect of the bill before us today.", "Currently in Ontario, if a trespasser damages property, the courts can award only up to $2,000 in compensation for damages caused by the trespasser. To recover damages over $1,000, you have to file a separate and additional lawsuit in court. One thousand dollars is far too low and means that farmers and rural Ontarians are placed at a real disadvantage by the people who trespass and cause damage to their properties. It’s too much of a burden to ask landowners to hire a lawyer and file a lawsuit if they want to recover $1,200 or even $3,000 for damages caused by this trespasser.", "I’m a steelworker from Hamilton, not a rural landowner, but it would infuriate me to see trespassers driving snowmobiles across my land without permission, knowing that they can effectively get away with tearing up my property.", "If someone causes damage to my property that I have to pay for, I shouldn’t have to file a lawsuit to get compensation. I shouldn’t have to pay for someone else’s antics and negligence, and I shouldn’t have to hire a lawyer and go through the whole process. It’s expensive. These trespassers know it, and it enables them. We have enough problems with access to justice in this province without that.", "I strongly support increasing the amount of damages that a court can order without the landowner having to file a civil lawsuit. Twenty-five thousand dollars seems to me to be a reasonable cut-off point.", "On the other aspect of the bill, I’m also supportive of imposing a minimum fine. But I would like to make some constructive comments on this bill, and I hope that my colleague can enlighten the House on this point and potentially address this in committee.", "I would like to know the logic behind setting $500 as the minimum fine. It is the job of judges to consider the gravity of the offence when determining the appropriate sentence.", "A blanket minimum fine of $500 may not be fair and proportionate in every circumstance. I wonder what my colleague would think of building a little flexibility into this bill. We might consider, for instance, allowing the landowner to ask the court not to impose the $500 fine, but only charge to the trespasser the landowner’s legal costs and expenses of coming to court, as well as the damages. That would be a more than sufficient deterrent. We were all young and foolish once, and landowners will recognize that.", "I understand that a minimum fine will act to some degree as a deterrent to trespassers, and that it’s something that is certainly in the interests of rural Ontarians. However, if my colleague is seeking to prevent judges from imposing trivial or nominal fines, why was the level of $500 chosen instead of, say, $100 or $200?", "The province of Prince Edward Island currently imposes a minimum fine of $200 for this offence, which I believe is the highest in Canada by some distance. Newfoundland and Labrador have a minimum fine of $10, which doesn’t strike me as very much of a deterrent.", "The reason I am questioning this point of the bill is that it would make Ontario something of a leader, but also an exception and a standout in Canadian law. Like Ontario, most Canadian provinces do not currently impose a minimum fine for trespassing. For example, British Columbia, Alberta, Nova Scotia and Manitoba do not have mandatory minimum fines for trespassing.", "The value of a minimum fine is a very significant decision, and if we’re proposing to go far above the norm in other Canadian jurisdictions, it seems to me that this aspect of the bill should be examined and justified in committee. I would hope that my colleague is open to that possibility.", "I’m supportive of landowners against trespassers, and I’m supportive of some level of minimum fine. But I would like to make sure that whatever minimum fine we do impose in the province is chosen after professional input and justified by evidence. So, I would like to see the evidence and logic more clearly before we settle on this particular value.", "This worthy bill addresses two of the concerns that many Ontarians have had about trespassers: first, the weak deterrent effect of our current laws, and second, the great difficulty that our current laws create for farmers and landowners just trying to get rightful compensation for damages caused by trespassers.", "I have rural landowners in my riding, and I’m going to talk to some of them to see what their thoughts are on this bill. I’m interested in their comments and suggestions, and I will most certainly bring them to the attention of the committee that considers this bill.", "For a little bit of a sideline here, I’d like to remind the House that there are other concerns not addressed here, and which may be considered by members of the government at some future date.", "We may wish to debate and examine the Occupiers’ Liability Act, to be reassured that this is properly achieving its objectives. I know that many homeowners, farmers and landowners are concerned about the legal consequences if a trespasser is injured on their property. Ontarians should be reassured that there are exemptions to the basic duty of care they owe to the users of their property. Specifically, rural trespassers are responsible for their own safety. Non-paying entrants to a rural property are responsible for their own safety when using rural property for permitted recreational purposes, and of course, people who enter for criminal purposes are considered to have assumed all risks, although that does not mean we can set traps and create hazards that deliberately risk, injure or kill.", "In conclusion, Speaker, I commend my colleague for this bill.

For example, a tenant can be banned entry to a property by issuing a notice orally or in writing. Signs can also be posted on a property to indicate that entry is not permitted or is banned.", "It is an offence to trespass, and I can understand why my colleague from Caledon would present this bill, coming from a rural area like Caledon, which actually neighbours Brampton–Springdale. It is an offence, and if a person is charged and found guilty, the person can be fined up to $2,000, and in addition, a court can order a person found guilty of trespassing to pay for damages to the property.", "What the member from Caledon has introduced is an amendment to strike out “‘a fine of not more than $2,000’ in the portion after clause (b) and substituting ‘a fine of not less than $500 and not more than $2,000’”. However, many trespass charges are laid for minor infractions such as hanging out in a mall or blocking pedestrian traffic. The government does not believe that a minimum of $500, as proposed by the bill, is appropriate in such cases. We prefer to let the judge levy the right fine for the circumstances before the court.", "Much of the problem with the law of trespass in rural areas is enforcement. It is not possible to have police officers patrolling every field, woodlot and trail in the province. For that reason, the act already authorizes property owners to arrest trespassers and to hold them until the police can arrive to lay charges. Bill 36 does not touch this provision, which may be useful in these particular cases.", "The government is considering the desirability of making changes to the Trespass to Property Act in response to consultations on strengthening the Ontario Trails Strategy held by the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport with stakeholders including the Ontario Federation of Agriculture.", "Trespassing is going to be difficult for everybody. We understand the damages that it could cause to rural property. It makes it difficult for the owners. They do have the provisions in the act to be able to arrest those people and to hold those people. If we were a lot more strict in enforcing the laws and the rules of trespassing that are currently in place, that could help some of the issues that the rural community is facing in Caledon and across the province. So we’re hoping that we can work on that.", "We’re hoping that we can look at the act, definitely, to amend it, because the maximum fine for the offence that we were looking at needs to be reconsidered, considering it was set at its current level in 1989. We’re definitely open to revisiting the idea; it’s just that we may have some differences on how we want to revisit the idea. There is a great problem with trespassing, especially in the rural area, but we need to balance it out with the fact that people who have minor trespassing charges and are found guilty shouldn’t be fined at the same level.", "We understand that when there is damage caused, the person is, right now, held liable for the damage that they are causing to the property. That should continue. I believe that continuing to actually charge those people and have those charges taken care of, have the costs taken care of, is only in fairness to the rural community, to our farmers and our agricultural community, but we also need to consider where there is no damage.", "The fines and the prices—although we need to revisit them, we need to look at how we’re going to revisit them and what the cost of revisiting them will be, what the fine should be set at, and take a look at the legislation. It is a great idea to revisit it, considering the date and the last time that we did look at it; it has been a long time. There have been many changes. It is a danger for all of our rural community, the damage that it may be causing for them. However, a lot of the trespassing charges are minor infractions, so we do have to take that under consideration. We’ll continue to look at that.", "“The act is amended by striking out ‘for an amount in excess of $1,000’ at the end and substituting ‘for an amount in excess of $25,000,’” right now. That is extreme. With the previous act—it is extreme. We need to find a way that it is less extreme, but we can still resolve the issue of trespassing." ],

It passed first reading, it passed second reading and it went to public hearings before the Standing Committee on Justice. Again, the purpose of the bill was to restore property rights to the province of Ontario—not just on farms but all property. Given that property rights are part of our heritage—people have come to this country, to this province to own property, something they may not have been allowed to do in their home country. Private ownership, the development of property, is a key incentive for economic growth and prosperity.", "There is a strong historical tradition in the western world of protecting property.

We’re not prohibited from buying or selling or possessing private property, but we have no written protection against that right being infringed upon at some point.

We have our problems, because people have a hard time differentiating between crown land and private land.", "I would like to dispel the image that people in the agriculture business don’t want to—that we are against anyone else enjoying the countryside, because that’s not true. I’ll give you an example. Across my property, we have the “A” snowmobile trail of the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs. They are very good to work with and have always been good to work with, but there came a point when we, and they, had a lot of trouble with people abusing their rights on the trails and, as such, were crossing our land in places where they weren’t actually allowed. With our climatic conditions, if you cross an alfalfa field and pack the snow down, you’ll kill the alfalfa.", "It came to a head, and we sat down with the Federation of Snowmobile Clubs and said, “Look, unless this is fixed, we’re closing the trail.” We worked together with the snowmobile clubs, and they worked together with their members to contain the people who were abusing the system.", "This type of legislation would hopefully do the same thing, because the vast majority of people understand and respect each other’s property and each other’s property rights. But it’s the minority who tend to ruin it for the majority. The minority, when they know that there are no real repercussions to their actions, tend to abuse other people’s rights even more. Legislation like this, where there actually are repercussions if you wilfully damage or wilfully use another’s property without permission, would be a step forward.", "Now, if and when—and hopefully—this bill gets to committee, we can always look at amending something to make something a little bit better, or change it for someone’s whim or fancy, but the idea that there should be stronger repercussions when someone wilfully uses or damages another piece of property—we’ve had it on our farm. We always check on the Ski-Doo trail. The Ski-Doo club does a fantastic job of making sure there is nothing left on the Ski-Doo trail, but we have had occasions when the snowmobiles left the trail, and sometimes they’ll leave a lunch bucket or something; and when that goes through your Discbine, it’s not pretty.

One would think that maybe the provisions we’re discussing here today would have immediate application to that great agricultural riding, but I want to assure the House that it hasn’t been a rural, agricultural riding since about 1902, which was when the last Liberal was elected in Beaches–East York, almost 112 years ago—1902.", "In those days, there was corn and alfalfa—cash crops—in Beaches–East York, but now it’s a very different situation, so you will appreciate that the kinds of concerns that the member from Dufferin–Caledon is raising are not concerns directly associated with the residents, the constituents I deal with on a day-to-day basis. However, there are other issues attached to the Trespass to Property Act which do apply, principally around private properties—malls, stores, and even parks, schoolyards and such—where misdemeanours and things are happening, which also have to be taken into consideration as we move forward in discussion with this bill.", "I’m also delighted that the member from Haldimand–Norfolk started with a bit of a historical lesson on the rights of property, going back to the Magna Carta. I also want to talk a bit about a great philosophic mentor in my own personal life, the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Those of you who have studied some philosophy will remember that Jean-Jacques Rousseau spoke at length about how all men are born free, but everywhere are in chains. That was his famous slogan.", "That concept of being born free, but shackled, spoke directly to property tax rights. In his First Discourse, he talked about how when society went and put fences around common property, that was the source of all social evils, because once you claim this as your own then you want to protect it as your own, and that’s when people took up arms against each other: to protect those rights of property.", "Now, we’ve moved way past the gentle philosophic musings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. We do respect property rights because things are happening on people’s private property for which there is value. We on the government side, I can assure you, take very seriously that when there is damage to private property as a result of trespass, it’s a serious offence and it needs to be taken care of.", "It was 1989 since the fines in this particular act were adjusted, and I can assure all members of the House that our government has taken a very close look at issues around the fines structure.

What a beautiful, beautiful part of Ontario. It does give me great pleasure as a flyfisher to go up to the Forks. One the great challenges I often find is getting access to the river, because of private property rights. I’ll drive around and find a bridge crossing the Credit. I’ll want to park the car and, “No fishing here” and “No trespassing here.” I mean, access to the river is a real, real big issue. Being on the river, that’s public property, and there’s no issue if I’m on the river, but I can’t get to the river unless I sort of jump over the bridge or maybe hang a rope ladder of some sort to get down and spend some time fishing in the river.", "I can assure you that as a flyfisher I have a very gentle approach to the trespasses I might occasionally have indulged in in the past where I’m just trying to get to the river. I’m not damaging anything. There will be those times I’ll be walking down the river after an hour or an hour and a half and catching some of those beautiful brook trout and speckled trout and browns, and I’ll have to come out. I’ll be in the middle of private property, trying to get back to my car, where walking along the river isn’t really accessible.", "So it’s absolutely important that we take a more holistic view sometimes to how people manage, that we chill out a little bit about, “This is mine. Thou shall not go.” But the issue of the damage associated when people do go should be taken very, very seriously; and I know our government will do so.", "Now, the bill does not speak to enforcement issues. I mean, clearly, that is a serious, serious issue. We take it very seriously. We have been doing work with the Ontario Trails Strategy. We are reviewing issues around access because we know people are violating, and it is a serious concern, as the member notes. It’s a question of how to address those.", "It is very disconcerting to all of us, as we know the frustrations experienced by rural property owners. After a time it is just so frustrating that we talked about traps or snares and stringing cable across trails to stop people going where they’re not supposed to go. We all know that’s totally unacceptable, but it deals with that incredible frustration that I’m sure so many people in rural Ontario feel that people aren’t respecting—and it’s not about just being on my land; it’s about being on my land and doing damage.", "I’m very encouraged by this bill. I’m pretty confident we will send it to committee and take a hard look at it. I’ve got to tell you, though, that a minimum fine of $500 for what could be just a simple nuisance is probably excessive. I take from the member from Hamilton East and his comments that you still have to give judicial discretion around what you’re going to charge someone for doing a simple trespass; and $500 may be too much. But raising the upper end, particularly on the compensation part of the file, I think is a very important consideration. Because it’s important that if there has been serious damage, a judge should be able, without having to go to the necessary expense of a long civil suit, hiring lawyers—we all know exactly how difficult that process is. In fact, in my experience, suing anybody for less than $10,000 or $20,000 is just not worth your time any more. It’s unfortunate because the damages people sustain are real and there should be some kind of incentives or sticks in the enforcement to ensure that people are not taking advantage and are respecting the trails and respecting rights of farmers.", "Those of us in the downtown sector are not as conscious, maybe, of the damage we may be doing to an alfalfa patch by inadvertently walking over it, as others aren’t as conscious when their dogs are peeing on our front lawn and ruining our rose bushes.", "So we will be sending this to committee, and we look forward to making adjustments as it goes forward. It’s a great bill. Thank you for bringing it forward." ],

Bill 36 would impose a minimum fine of $500 for trespassing, address farm safety and biosecurity concerns related to trespassing, and increase the limit on compensation for damages from $1,000 to $25,000.", "Ontario farm fields are enticing, wide-open spaces for rural neighbours and visitors straying from designated trails or adjacent land. It’s not uncommon for these uninvited trespassers to ride around farm fields on their ATVs, damaging crops and property, disturbing animals and even posing a threat to the farm’s biosecurity. Biosecurity is becoming an increasing concern on farms, where the spread of plant and animal diseases is a continuous threat. We’ve all filled out the forms at the airport where we’re asked if we’re bringing food products or seeds or animal products into the county, because of concerns. And for farmers, of course, this is their livelihood, and they’ve invested a lot into it. When unwanted visitors enter farm property on foot, they could be bringing a lot worse than just $1,000 worth of damage. It’s not just about footprints on alfalfa; it’s much bigger than that.", "This is an issue that has risen, not decreased, over the past decade. Trespassing on Ontario farms has become far too common, and the low level of enforcement when offenders are caught and charged means farmers are often on the hook for damages. It’s my hope that adding minimum fines and increasing damage awards will elevate the seriousness of this trespassing situation with regional law enforcers and dissuade potential wrongdoers from picking on our province’s bread-and-butter workers. Increasing compensation for farmers would go a long way to replacing livestock, crops or any other kind of damages.", "You know what? Even though I don’t live in a rural riding—Thornhill is really part of the GTA—we have all gone up into cottage country; my dad is up on Lake Chemong, just north of Peterborough. We have had trespassers who have been fishing—just as the member from the Beaches mentioned before—and just wandered on to your property. They’ve decided that they needed to come on to dry land for a spell.", "I think it’s something that people don’t necessarily address enough. We have really done a great job educating people that people’s bodies are their own and you cannot touch people or touch their personal property; say, their purse or car. But I think we have to address the fact that people’s land is not crown land, that it could be private property, and if you’re not sure if it’s crown land or private property, you should assume that it’s private property. You shouldn’t say, “Well, I thought it was crown land.” If there’s no sign suggesting that it is, then you should assume that it’s not.", "The other issue is insurance. People are liable if somebody comes on their property and gets hurt. We’ve all heard the tragic stories of people going for a dip in somebody’s pool without permission and then, when something happens to them, the property owner is not able to fight by saying, “I did not give this person permission.”", "So I’m happy to support the member from Dufferin–Caledon’s efforts to address this inequity and I hope to see this bill progress quickly." ],

There are other people on that land. You can’t see it all the time.

For reasons I’ll get into later, I believe the time is now to make the most powerful political position in York region directly accountable to the people whom the chair represents.", "First, let me tell you a little bit about how the selection of the chair of York region is currently conducted. York region, as many of you might know, is an upper-tier municipality, comprised of representatives from the lower-tier municipalities that make up the region. The lower tier is comprised of the individual councils of the nine area municipalities—the town of East Gwillimbury, the town of Georgina, the township of King, the city of Markham, the town of Richmond Hill, the city of Vaughan, the town of Whitchurch-Stouffville and, of course, the towns of Newmarket and Aurora, which make up my riding.", "The upper tier—that is, York regional council—is composed of 21 members. These members include the nine mayors and 11 regional councillors who are elected at the lower-tier municipalities.", "The 21st member is the regional chair and CEO, who is not elected but is appointed by the other 20 members of regional council.", "The number of representatives that each municipality elects to regional council ranges from only the mayor, in the smaller municipalities such as Aurora, and up to four regional councillors in the larger ones.", "Mayors and regional councillors are elected in a double direct format where successful members are elected to both local council and regional council. The only requirement to hold the position of chair is that the selected individual be a permanent resident of York region.", "Heading the regional council, as I said, the chair is currently appointed by regional councillors at the inaugural meeting of the newly elected councillors, and that appointment is at the heart of my bill, because an area that is growing as quickly as York region deserves to have a chair who is directly accountable to the people.", "Since the creation of the region in 1971, its population has grown dramatically. In just over 40 years, the region’s population has increased more than sevenfold, from 169,000 in 1971 to more than 1.1 million people in 2014.", "During my time as councillor in Aurora, I was always in support of seeing the role of chairperson become an elected position.", "I have been told that the inaugural council meeting to select the new regional chair will be held on December 11. I’d like to thank the outgoing chair, Bill Fisch, for his work on behalf of the region of York, and I’m looking forward to working with the new chair.", "I want to emphasize at this time the fact that the proposed legislation will not impact the selection of the next chair on December 11.", "It’s important to note that my hope is that over the next four years, until the next municipal election in 2018, residents of York will have an opportunity to cultivate and perhaps identify candidates for nomination for the position of chair, because I feel that it’s time to bring York region into the modern democratic age.", "I must thank the member from Oak Ridges–Markham for her dedication to see this change made. During our discussions, I not only learned that few people in York actually know the name of the chair, but only five individuals have held that position in its 43-year history. That means that, over almost half a century, only Garfield Wright, Bob Forhan, Tony Roman, Eldred King and Bill Fisch have held the powerful position of chair of York region. This bill does not in any way diminish their accomplishments, which are many. However, it’s time for a new selection process for the office of regional chair. This bill is about moving forward in a democratic fashion to ensure accountability to the people of York region. The office of the chair has evolved, and it’s time for us to move on.", "In a region full of growth and expansion, York region deserves to have a direct say in the election of the chair. This is something I firmly believe in, and many of my constituents agree. In fact, I took the last several months since being elected to talk to as many people as possible across York region about this concept, and I would say that, universally, the reaction was positive.", "In fact, across York region, as I said, the idea of an elected chair is spreading. In recent editorials in both the Newmarket Era and the Aurora Banner, the newspapers said that the idea of an elected chair should receive strong support. Both said that it’s a move in the right direction.", "My constituency office, as well, has heard from many residents who have given me their support in moving ahead with Bill 42.", "Let me make this point clear, Mr. Speaker: If passed, this bill will bring more accountability to the office, along with more stature. This bill is about democracy. It’s time for the most powerful position in York region government to receive a mandate from the people the chair represents.", "During my time as councillor in Aurora, as I’ve said, I quickly learned the mechanics of regional council, and I must say that the chair and CEO was directly involved in the decision-making processes. There’s no confusion about this fact, and that’s why I was excited to see initial work being done by the MPPs from Richmond Hill and Oak Ridges–Markham.", "I’ve been supportive of the changes since major discussions started in the mid-1990s.", "Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, that it has been quite frustrating to see the bill die on the House floor because of an unnecessary election, but it does bring me some satisfaction—besides the fact that that election allowed me to be here—-to continue the work of my colleagues and bring forward Bill 42.", "I believe it’s high time that the position of chair and CEO of York region, as the role is currently entitled, is far too powerful an office for an unelected individual to hold. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you why I and so many of my constituents feel that way.", "Let’s go over just a few of the powers that the regional chair and CEO currently appointed is responsible for. The regional chair oversees a budget of nearly $3 billion, including overseeing the debt of the region. He or she would make appointments to regional council committees. The chair has an immense amount of power over how the business of the region is conducted.", "The chair, as the only full-time York region council member, is responsible for the operation of services provided by the region of York. The tax-supported services provided by York region are vital to our everyday lives. They include regional planning, transit, community services and housing, court services, emergency medical services or land ambulance, public health, long-term care, employment and financial support, waste management, forestry, roads, provision of water and sewage disposal. Additionally, the chair plays a critical role in setting the strategic course of the region. Among other initiatives, the chair oversees the implementation of the York region official plan, the transportation master plan and the York region sustainability strategy.", "One thing I learned very quickly as a member of the Aurora town council was the impact that the region played on our planning. Some may think that when we’re elected to a lower-tier municipality we have significant say over what takes place in our town regarding planning, but that’s simply not the case. The region has an awful lot of authority to be able to, whether we’re willing or unwilling, help us shape our development. Time and again we heard complaints and concerns from residents of our towns that the region was exercising that authority perhaps against the will of the people who live there. Perhaps a direct election of the chair will go to making that position a little more sensitive to what the people want in their communities.", "There are all these plans, as I mentioned, that directly impact the residents of York, including my constituents in Newmarket–Aurora. Something that resonates with me is that the individual in that position gets to wear the chain of office. It’s funny how many people assumed that the regional chair was an elected official because they wore the chain of office. The chain, in their mind, denotes a measure of assumed responsibility. Along with the chain of office come certain expectations.", "This bill lends legitimacy to the office of chair and CEO. If passed, the chain of office will mean that the individual has received the mandate from the voters of York region. Like mayors and regional chairs across the province, York’s chair would face the expectations of York region’s electorate.", "This demand from York region residents to give the regional chair and CEO a mandate is not a new demand, and more and more regions are converting to this model. The region of Waterloo, for example, has elected its chair for the past 17 years, and the region of Halton has elected its chair for the past 14 years. In Durham region, which has appointed its chair since 1973, it just recently directly elected its first regional chair and CEO in this past 2014 municipal election.", "It is time for York region to join other members of the GTHA and assure citizens that they’re able to execute their democratic right by directly electing the regional chair and CEO. After bringing this bill to the floor three times now, it’s clear that the residents of York region are demanding change. In the past, this bill has received all-party support, and I hope that will happen again today. York region deserves the right to join other members of the GTHA in practising democracy and accountability when electing their regional chair and CEO." ],

In my region, this was a decision that was made in 2010. On October 27, this year, the region of Durham elected its first regional chair.", "In Durham, it was a debate that went on for a number of years and was finally settled by a referendum during the 2010 municipal election. The question posed to all residents of Durham was as follows: “Are you in favour of the council of the regional municipality of Durham passing the necessary resolutions and bylaws to change the method of selecting its chair from appointment by members of regional council to election by general vote of all electors in the region? Yes or no.”", "It presented a straightforward question and ensured that not only would voters be allowed to choose who their regional chair would be, but also whether it was a change that they even felt they needed.", "Ultimately, nearly 80% of those who made it to the polls voted in favour of electing the regional chair, which represented a pretty resounding show of support. Though the result was not technically binding, as voter turnout was less than 50%, council still acted on the recommendation of the referendum and passed a bylaw on April 4, 2012, to change the method of selection to a general vote. Of course, this raises the question of why York region has taken the approach of provincial legislation instead of a local bylaw, but ultimately it will lead to the same result.", "This is also a bill that this Legislature has seen a number of times over the past five years, as we have heard, and hopefully we are able to resolve this issue once and for all.", "I understand that residents have been surveyed, and the majority have stated their preference for an elected chair as well, though the referendum approach does provide a more official view. Regardless, the opinion of the general public has been taken into account and ensures that the individual in what is often referred to as the highest office in the region is held to account as well.", "So far, I have spoken quite a bit about Durham, as it is the piece of the puzzle that I know the best, but a number of other regions have also gone through the process of shifting from an appointed to an elected regional chair. Halton and Waterloo have both made the change, as did Hamilton-Wentworth before the eventual amalgamation of the municipality. The only regions that continue to select their chairs via council appointment are Peel, Niagara and, of course, York.", "As I said earlier, the role of regional chair is one that has changed and evolved over time. As their power has grown, so has the need for greater accountability. Unelected chairs tend to remain in office for an unusually long time, which is even more reason why it is important for the public to have its say.", "Seeing as I am coming from the classroom, I figured I should also provide a quick history lesson as well. We have spoken quite a bit about the reasons for this change, but sometimes it can be useful to have that historical context. When Ontario’s regional designations were first established in the 1970s, the first regional chairs were appointed by the province with the intention that, going forward, we would follow the county model and allow for appointment by council. But of course, a lot has changed since the 1970s. As the province has grown, so have the powers of the regional chairs. So today we are making sure that the selection of a regional chair evolves along with the role.", "As I said earlier in my remarks, what we are really speaking about today is democracy. Democracy is not always easy, and sometimes it can be loud and messy. But it is the foundation of all the things we love about our province and about our country. It is the embodiment of the principle that as a whole we are greater than the sum of our individual parts, and it is why we are all here today.

However, it is not surprising that since it was only regional council members who partook in that discussion, no consensus was reached and no action was taken, which is hardly surprising, as it would require regional councillors to give up their exclusive power to select the chair.", "I had the privilege of serving as medical officer of health for York region from 1988 and commissioner of health services from 1997 until my retirement in 2006.

In order to reflect these changes, I believe an appropriate governance structure is needed.", "At this point, I would like to make sure that all members understand the great deal of power that the York regional chair and CEO has in regard to the business of the region. For example, the chair sets the direction of council, has control over the agenda of council meetings and sits as an ex officio member on all committees. In fact, the chair is the only member of council who works full-time on regional business, as the other councillors must attend to the business of their area municipalities as well.", "The responsibilities of the regional chair have increased dramatically as York region has grown. Today, the regional chair is responsible for a budget of nearly $3 billion. It is quite astonishing that responsibility for these taxpayer dollars is vested in an unelected official. Furthermore, the regional chair is the official spokesperson for the region and frequently has a role in representing the region on the national and even international stage. As York region’s website suggests, its economy, at $43 billion, is bigger than four Canadian provinces, and an elected chair would give added legitimacy in this circumstance as well.", "I would like to acknowledge, however, that this bill does not in any way diminish the accomplishments of the five individuals who have held the position over the last 42 years, specifically Garfield Wright, Bob Forhan, Tony Roman, Eldred King and Bill Fisch. I’ve known them all. Unfortunately, three of these gentlemen have passed away, but I can personally attest to their hard work and the important contributions they’ve made. Moreover, I would like to take this moment to acknowledge the current chair, Bill Fisch, who, after 17 years, has decided to retire. I’d like to personally thank him for his years of service and tireless dedication in helping to build York region.", "However, at this point in time, I believe it is time to join other regions of the GTHA and modernize the selection process for the office of the York regional chair. Often, I’ll ask my constituents if they know the name of the current regional chair. With the exception of some municipal employees and a few others, it is rare to find anyone who does. By contrast, the name of their local mayor is almost universally known.", "Allowing the citizens of York region to elect their regional chair will help underscore the importance of this position. If the chair of York regional council is elected by citizens, the individuals who seek election will likely develop a platform that outlines a vision for the region. Upon election, accountability to the electorate will be clear. At the subsequent election, the electorate can judge whether the incumbent deserves re-election.

I haven’t been here for all of the other presentations of this similar bill since I was only elected this past year, but I’ve been a resident of York region in Thornhill for over 26 years.", "I think that one of the important points that maybe isn’t getting through today is that so many people in York region aren’t even aware that there is a chairperson of York region. A lot of people, especially the newcomers, are unaware that there’s an entire level of government. Toronto used to have Metro—I think people remember that. We’re not going to talk about whether or not the city should have been amalgamated. It does come up for discussion every now and then in York region—whether there should be the city of York region. I’ll have to ask the member from Newmarket–Aurora if he hears about that every now and then as well.", "We do have this level of government in York region, the regional government, and other regional governments have moved towards making the chairperson an elected position. Right now, in case people watching at home don’t understand, what happens is that the regional council is made up of regional councillors, of course, and the mayors of six cities in York region. It’s not exactly evenly distributed by population how the numbers work out for representation on the council. I live in Vaughan, and Vaughan has three regional councillors and one mayor who sit on the council, and they represent a population of over 300,000 people. There are much smaller communities which are perhaps a quarter or a sixth of the population of Vaughan but have significantly more representation per person, if you work it out. If we’re talking about democratic principles, it’s not very democratic just on that principle, if I can say it that way, that these regional councillors and mayors of the various cities are choosing the chairperson.", "Just for the record, the chairperson of York region is a very desirable position. The salary is higher than in the city of Toronto. Bill Fisch recently retired. I would have liked to have gone to his retirement dinner. I’m sure the minister was there, but my invitation must have gotten lost in the mail.", "Interjections." ],

It’s a big responsibility, and I’m not saying that there shouldn’t be good remuneration for it, but right away we are waiting until after the recent municipal election to talk about who the next chair is going to be. Who are putting their names forward? People who have just been elected within months, within weeks. They’ve just been elected in expensive elections, and they’re putting their names forward—wonderful candidates.", "I know John Taylor fairly well, because when I did a talk show on Rogers he was my guest a couple of times. He’s putting his name forward, as is, I think, the mayor of Stouffville, and regional councillor Jim Jones , whom I have a lot of respect for, in Markham. What happens when one of them is inevitably chosen? It means that we have to have a by-election in an entire city, because for regional councillors and the mayor it’s not a small ward; it’s the entire city of Markham, Vaughan or Newmarket—or Stouffville, King City or Aurora. I’m sorry if I’m missing something in there.", "But this, to me, is a waste of taxpayers’ money. If we’re going to appoint a chairperson—which we have to, because we just had the election—why couldn’t it have been done before the election? That’s number one.", "Number two is that the regional council has a lot of say on our regional roads. I’m often talking to people in Thornhill and across York region about the rapidways that are being built on regional roads. This is something that the regional council decides, and I feel that, if the chairperson was an elected position, he would feel a little more uncomfortable with choosing to go forward with a project that the residents are so much against.", "Obviously, I support this bill. I’m unsure why this has been debated for so many hours in the House. It’s sort of like having elections over and over again, and by-elections; it’s very expensive. I think that it behooves all of us to respect the taxpayers’ money and respect all of our time and the taxpayers’ time, so I hope to see this go through and that, at the next municipal elections across Ontario in four years, York region will be electing a chair for the York region council." ],

In this particular case, for York region, the position that we are talking about oversees a budget of more than $3 billion, which of course has been mentioned by several of the MPPs. That’s probably a significant piece as to why this bill was brought forward: because a budget of $3 billion should equal accountability and transparency. I think that’s what the member who introduced it in the House and members before him have stressed. It’s important that people feel that their tax dollars are being used wisely, and that the person representing that fiscal budget is elected.", "We are taught from a very young age that the best form of government is one that the people elects, where citizens participate in the process by voting for their choice of representatives. But here we have an instance in York region that escapes that direct application of democracy through appointment, instead of electing their chair.", "Currently only Peel, Niagara and York regions continue to select their chair through council appointment. However, it should be noted that Niagara does have a policy on the books that requires that the chair be an elected member of council, while Peel and York do not.", "We are seeing greater and greater calls for transparency and accountability at all levels of government. The more we continue to operate in the shadows, the less trust we inspire in those we aim to represent. This bill is an important step in the right direction.", "It shows the people of this province that we can adapt outdated forms of governance to become democratically accountable and to truly reflect their will. Given that direct democracy allows citizens the most control over their government, electing our regional chairs should be seen as the best method of selection. In fact, representatives who depend on re-election to keep their jobs must reflect the will of the people who voted for them and not their own personal or political agendas.", "Also, I have grave concerns regarding the fairness of the appointment process. We know that women make up 48% of the workforce in Canada but account for only about 16% of board members of Canada’s FP500 companies. In fact, out of 448 companies that responded to a recent government survey, 57% have no women directors, 53% have women in fewer than 10% of their executive officer positions, and none of this speaks to the lack of representation of people of colour and other marginalized demographics in our community.", "If we look back to where this process of appointment began, it will take us back to 1849, when the system of local government was established by the Baldwin Act. That’s a long time, Speaker. The head of the county council was called a warden, and the warden was selected by the county councillors for a one-year term.", "When Ontario regions were created in the 1970s, the first regional chairs were appointed by the province, but the system going forward was meant to be like the county system, in that regional chairs would be selected by councillors.", "However, over time, regional chairs were given greater leadership and abilities than wardens, because regional chairs are selected for the full term of council. Over time, there has been a movement from selection and secrecy to popular election of regional chairs. It’s also important to note that unelected regional chairs tend to remain in office for an unusually long time, suggesting that the position depends more on political favours than democratic legitimacy. We have seen the movement and a push toward greater accountability for several regions, including Halton, Waterloo, Hamilton-Wentworth and Durham.", "I have a sense that appointed officials who serve at the pleasure of local municipal officials are concerned less with voters’ rights and turnout and more with administrative burdens, costs and security. While those are important issues to consider, when any appointee is responsible for a $3-billion budget, we must defer to the people. They must have a seat at the table through a democratic process, and what better way to achieve this than by giving voters exactly what they voted for?", "Now it’s time for Peel region to follow the lead of other governments, and it is up to all of us here to ensure that we help them get there. The legislation can help to make that vision a reality, and I encourage all members of the House to support this bill.", "Obviously, the government side has brought this bill to this Legislative Assembly more than once. Perhaps any bill we could speak to, we can say what our feelings are, but moving it forward sounds like the right thing to do, and helping it along so that the people of York region are served in the best capacity with an elected official, with a budget of $3 billion, and have that responsibility and accountability, as we all should as elected officials when you have the public purse, and do the right thing.", "I thank you for the time that I was allowed to speak on this bill, and congratulate the member for bringing it forward.

Now that our region is one of the fastest-growing areas in the country, it’s time for a change.", "Accountability is a virtue in our democracy that Canadians value. The residents of York region are no different. The chair directs the vision for the region. Currently, those on the council appoint the individual who sets that vision, not the people of York region.", "Across the province, electing the chair of the region is a very common trend. The region of Waterloo, as mentioned before, has elected their regional chair since 1997; along with Halton region, which has elected their chair since 2000.

We are doing the 1.1 million residents of York region a disservice by not providing them with the ability to choose their regional chair. As outlined by my colleagues from Newmarket–Aurora and Oak Ridges–Markham, the chair of a region holds a great deal of power and needs to be accountable to the residents and not just the 20 members of regional council.", "Across the country, accountability and transparency are important parts of our democracy. York region is facing an accountability and transparency deficit with the selection of the regional chair. Bill 42 seeks to fix that.", "Once again, I would like to thank the member from Newmarket–Aurora for bringing this bill to the floor yet again, and the member from Oak Ridges–Markham for supporting this bill.

It would increase accountability and democracy. Currently in York region, after each election, the council appoints a non-elected person to be chair. That means the most senior municipal regional representative doesn’t receive a single vote from the people he or she represents. Mr. Speaker, it would be like having the mayor of Toronto appointed by Toronto city councillors instead of being elected by the people.", "This system has evolved from the county system, where a warden is chosen by council. But one important difference is that the warden is chosen from the elected members on council, which means that they have already been democratically elected in their own area. Of course, then they maintain that seat during the term that they are the warden. I had the privilege of being one of those. For three years I was mayor of South-West Oxford and at the same time I was the warden of Oxford county, which for all practical purposes was the region of Oxford county.", "In fact, as I said, the fourth time it has been here, and it has been unanimously supported all three times it was here. It highlights a problem with our system. Since this bill was first introduced in April 2012, we have gone through a municipal election where this change could have been implemented. In fact, given that the previous chair was retiring after five terms this past election, it might have been an ideal time for the change to occur. Now, even if this bill is passed quickly, the people of York region won’t have the opportunity to vote for their chair until the 2018 municipal election.", "That’s part of the problem we have with private members’ bills. Regardless of how much support they have, they have difficulty getting to third reading. I can attest to that, having gone through five years with a private member’s bill: five times introduced, five times unanimously supported, but it still took five years to get it passed, and it just passed this year.", "We all agree that this bill would increase the accountability and make the system more democratic, and the people of York region want the change.

You walk into and have a hot shower, and then you’re given another set of clothes. This is called biosecurity. Compare that to the security in a hospital. Then, when you leave again, you exchange clothes, you have another shower and then put your clothes back on—very strict biosecurity. Farmers go into a hog barn and they stay there all day. They have, in this operation, a full-blown kitchen: cupboards, stoves, everything. I wonder why our hospitals don’t run that way, quite honestly, given the infectious diseases that come out of some of those institutions.", "So I understand there are about 64 confirmed cases on farms in Ontario. Exports are so important for our Ontario hog market. We export far more to the US than we bring in. The flow of animals goes south; the trucks return empty. The trucks are probably where the virus came up, even though they’re washed, disinfected and dried at cleaning stations before they would come back to Ontario farms.", "I see my time is running out. I’d like to switch quickly to the cattle industry, beef cattle. We all recall the BSE contagion a number of years ago. It was out west. Here is an industry that also could benefit from the kind of proactive measures that we are debating in this Legislature today. I had the good fortune to grow up with cattle, both beef and dairy. We had dual-purpose Polled Shorthorns. “Polled” means you don’t have to cut their horns off; genetically, they arrive without horns." ],

It’s one of those older English breeds. I know our family had raised them for generations. Oftentimes we see cattle now on some of the gully land or the rocky land; you certainly see it up in northern Ontario. There’s a lot of potential to move beef into northern Ontario. Over the last 10 years, Ontario has lost half the herd. I know in Haldimand county, down my way, half the head of cattle are down there now than there used to be. Essentially half the beef farmers switched over to cash crops.", "Let’s see. In 2002, the Canadian beef industry was worth about $8 billion, and in 2003, 17% of the fed cattle in our country were here in Ontario. We’re the second-largest producer after Alberta.", "Before that BSE outbreak, half the Canadian beef production was intended for export; the vast majority of live animal exports were headed to the United States. Meat exports were 70% to the Americans, with the remainder split between Mexico, Japan, South Korea, certainly. A number of years ago I was the parliamentary assistant to agriculture. We would have meetings in Toronto with the Korean beef buyers. This would be further down Bloor, around Christie Pits. There’s a famous Korean restaurant down that way. We’d get together down there.", "With the BSE, obviously the prices plummeted. You didn’t really see it at the retail level. This is an age-old concern of farmers, where the middleman reaps much of the profit and we don’t see the benefit for the consumer in the grocery store. It was estimated that at that time the Canadian beef sector was losing something like $11 million a day because of BSE trade bans. Fortunately, with pork, with PED, we’re not seeing the trade bans, even though we’re so dependent on exporting our pork. The Canadian Animal Health Coalition in June 2003 pegged the total economic impact of a four-month trade ban at $2.5 billion, and it kept building up over the years. After two years, Canada lost something like $7 billion. There was no production insurance, no mortality insurance—everything was ad hoc—the importance of what we’re talking about today.", "It even hit the dairy industry. It’s not their bread and butter, but dairy producers, dairymen, sell their older animals for beef. In the abattoir, every animal counts. In the abattoir, they don’t just sell steaks, they sell everything—everything coming together to make a profit.", "I mentioned that we always had sheep.

I’ll never do that again. You come home with a brand new car, and you come out the next morning and the goats are standing on top of your brand new car. I cannot handle goats. If you want training to be an elected representative, get a couple of goats.

The member keeps talking about what we’re doing now with neonics is a ban, and it really isn’t. Let’s be clear to the public: This is an aspirational target. We’ve identified that something like 20% of where it’s used it’s really effective and it needn’t be used prophylactically across the province.

Crop insurance goes back to 1938, when it was first established in the United States by the federal government to provide some stability with the dust bowl and the Depression. I know they did update it. It was first set up by the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. It focused on the major crops. They revised and expanded it. In 1980 they expanded it again, and in 1994. They’re still taking a look at it because, gosh, a year ago something like $14 billion went to farmers for safety nets in the US—this is who we’re competing against.

It changes it from the Crop Insurance Act to the agricultural products act, I believe. That needs to happen in order to proceed, but that doesn’t guarantee that other products will actually be covered. It’s changing the wording. It’s an important step, but a very small step.

It’s shared 40% by farmers, 24% by the province and 36% by the feds, and there’s the issue, because there’s no money on the table. We waited 11 years for a word, but there’s no money on the table, and that’s really important, Speaker, because we know that there’s no money in a lot of places. In fact, a lot of places are losing money.", "There is another program where farmers worked together with previous Ministers of Agriculture. It’s a risk management program. The production insurance that we’re talking about today covers the actual production: how many tonnes of crop you get from a field, how many bushels of potatoes, how many—okay? Risk management covers the price you get. With risk management you can insure yourself to make sure that—because crop prices go up and down, so it can kind of even it out. Agricultural groups, with the provincial government, got together and they did a really good job. They created a risk management program bar none for the province of Ontario. It was bankable; it was predictable. That’s what agriculture needed. Then this government capped it.", "It was estimated that for this program to run efficiently and to make sure that the agricultural sector, the base production sector, which actually drives the agri-food industry in our province, which creates, I believe, $30 billion or $34 billion in economic activity and fuels 740,000 or 750,000 jobs—that’s all based on the primary producer being solid, bankable and predictable so he can go to his bank and say, “I need to borrow X so I can plant my crops.”", "That’s what we had with the risk management program. Then this government capped it, so it’s no longer bankable or predictable. Does it help? Yes. Are the commodity organizations going to chastise the government? No, because at the end of the day, it’s the government. But, in all reality, Speaker, for that risk management program to work, the cap has to be raised close to what it was when the program was originally designed, which is between $175 million and $200 million.", "Why that’s important—before I lose my voice—and why that has something to do with production insurance is because for the production insurance to be moved over, or for the umbrella to cover more commodities, the money is going to have to come from somewhere to pay the province’s portion. That hasn’t been identified.", "Until that’s identified—because it could very well be that they could take another $25 million or $30 million out of risk management and put it into crop production insurance, and that really wouldn’t help anyone. That would actually be a step backward. That is a very important thing to realize, because until we start talking about how the dollars are going to work, we are all just talking. That’s very, very important.", "We’ve waited 11 years, because I’m sure after that fed-prov meeting in 2003 the commodities that weren’t covered were pretty excited, because Ontario was going to move in the right direction. They have waited 11 years for a word. Who knows how long we are going to have to wait until we actually have the regulations in place and the money. That’s very important.", "That’s how it works from the government side. A farmer puts 40% in, the province puts 24% of the premium in and the feds put 36%. That goes into a pool, and if there is a loss, then the money comes out of the pool. The idea is that enough farmers participate so the pool is big enough and the risk is put over enough acres and over enough commodities that there’s enough money in the pool to pay out those who have the misfortune of having crop loss due to pests, due to weather, due to disease. That’s how it’s supposed to work.", "For the large part, crop insurance is a good program. It has its hitches. All programs have their hitches.

I was surprised, because this government makes lots of noise about being focused on these issues. In his statement—I’m going to read the same statement again, a part of it: “As we all know, Ontario farmers grow and harvest a diverse range of crops and livestock. When unforeseen challenges such as pests, weather and disease strike, production insurance is there to provide coverage for losses and yield reductions.”", "Now, I was expecting him to spend quite a bit of time talking about pests—that’s what the neonicotinoids issue is about—and weather, because we hear “climate change,” and we are not climate change deniers. I know on my farm in northern Ontario we grow crops now that we couldn’t grow 15 years ago, partly because of better genetics in the crops but partly because we’re getting more heat units. But the weather is more unpredictable. We’ve heard the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change—I keep thinking he’s only the Minister of Climate Change, but he is the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, which is kind of the same thing—speak in this House about increasing food prices and how it’s going to be much more unpredictable. Obviously, the ministers don’t talk, because that is going to impact crop insurance immensely.", "I’ll give you an example in my riding for this year and last year. The way crop insurance works, it works a lot like other kinds of insurance. So if you have a claim, your premium goes up. It’s a pretty simple concept. The reason that is, and I understand it, is because sometimes farmers get a bit adventurous and they grow crops—you know, you grow corn where you know the corn is not going to yield too good. If you keep doing that, sure you’ll collect crop insurance once, but your insurance will go up, and that stops you from doing that in the future.", "I don’t have a problem with that concept. Where that runs into trouble, though, is where, due to climate change, a whole region can’t get its crops off. So that whole region, not due to any fault of the farmer, will have a hike in their crop insurance. If that happens again, they’ll have another hike in the crop insurance and they won’t be able to buy crop insurance because it will be too high. Do you know what happens, Speaker, when you can’t buy crop insurance? You can’t get a loan to put in your crops, because for many, before the bankers—and I don’t blame the bankers; I’m not anti-bank—will extend credit to a farmer to put in a crop, they want proof of crop insurance.", "In my case, in Timiskaming–Cochrane, last year we had a pest that we’ve never had before.

Because our temperature’s a little bit cooler, we had ideal conditions for canola, and quite frankly we could make pretty good money growing canola, so we all grew canola. Then comes the Swede midge.", "Now, I’m not a scientist, but what the Swede midge does is it goes for the growing point of the plant. It kills the growing point, so the plant compensates by growing around it and starting over. But as a result, the plant never matures; it just keeps growing and growing and growing, and never produces a crop.", "We sprayed and we sprayed, and we sprayed some more, but a lot of the fields were a total writeoff. That was not this summer, but last summer. The ones who were crop-insured got crop insurance, but their premiums went up because of that pest. Everybody with me now?", "So this summer, a lot of people didn’t grow canola, because the Swede midge is going to stick around for at least four years. A lot of people didn’t grow canola, so we grew other crops: corn, soybeans.", "This was the worst summer we’ve had, the old-timers tell me, since 1965—the coldest, the wettest—so a lot of our crops didn’t get off. Now, for those farmers, that’s hit number two. It’s not their own problem; it’s not their own cause. It wasn’t bad management; it wasn’t cutting back on fertilizer; it was purely weather, and if I’m listening to the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, it could very well be climate change. But now those farmers are behind the eight ball because they’ll have two claims in a row.", "Even on a personal level—not my person, but I’ll take an example. We have some fairly big farms in Timiskaming–Cochrane. Some of these farmers are cash croppers, elevator owners and custom farmers, so they’ll come and custom-combine your grain. Like I said, usually we have snow in—around now it starts. We’ve had snow for a month. I remember the member from Haldimand–Norfolk was talking about snow beans; ours should be blizzard beans, because we haven’t seen them for a while.", "A good friend of mine; he’s not alone, but he’s a good friend of mine, his family. Some people here might even know Norm Koch and his kids, Rob and Chad. If you ever drive through the TransCanada Highway and go through Earlton, you’ve got the town of Earlton on one side and Koch Farms on the other side, and they’re both about the same size. It’s a big farm—a family farm, but a big one.", "Norm does a lot of custom-combining, and Norm is a good custom-combiner. Norm treats your crop like his own. This year, Norm didn’t get a lot of his own crops off because he saved a lot of other people; he got their crops off. Now Norm is going to pay the price, and I think that’s something that we have to look at. That wasn’t mentioned at all: what climate change is going to do to crop insurance, what pests that we’ve never seen before are going to do to crop insurance and what they’re going to do to the commodities that the government is proposing to cover.", "Once again, we’re totally in favour—no problem at all about supporting this bill—but we were extremely disappointed that the minister didn’t take some time and actually recognize that if there are going to be huge changes in the climate in the future—in fact, I think the change is happening, because it’s getting pretty dry in here. It used to be that the climate was only going to get hotter. I think it’s going to be more erratic, because that’s what we’re experiencing. There’s going to have to be some kind of mention of how that’s going to impact agriculture and how that’s going to impact individual areas.", "I know in Timiskaming–Cochrane—" ],

They’re going to have a really tough winter. And it’s going to get tougher next spring, because it’s going to be hard for some of these people to get affordable crop insurance, not because of lack of management ability, but purely because of pests and weather conditions that they have never experienced before. It’s a good example for the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change. I was extremely disappointed that the Minister of Agriculture or his parliamentary assistant didn’t even bother to mention that. It’s really important.", "I don’t begrudge people who don’t have an agricultural background for not totally understanding our sector. I don’t totally understand other sectors all that well sometimes. But we do expect that ministers of the crown take the time to truly understand what’s going on. I truly hope that, going forward, we actually have a working relationship and don’t hear too many more cracks about how it took a member from Beaches–East York to bring this forward, because that won’t go over well in the farm community. We all want to work together. This shouldn’t be a politically divisive issue, but it could very well become one.", "Another issue I’d like to touch on is an issue that has been in the news a lot of late: the use of neonicotinoids. Again, I’m going to talk about this on two different levels: from the legislative level and from the dirt level, the people who actually plant.", "Is there a problem with neonicotinoids? I don’t think anyone is going to deny that. Can they affect pollinators? Yes. It is a pesticide. It’s not rocket science to think that a pesticide could affect insects.", "There was an issue with acute poisoning of bees, and that happened because of the dust coming off the treated seed, and the equipment that farmers use created more dust. The agricultural sector, the equipment sector, the seed companies and the chemical companies worked together to solve that problem. I think the acute poisoning problem from dust has been largely, if not eliminated—you can’t honestly say that it has been eliminated, but it has been largely controlled. I think we can be safe to say that it has been largely controlled.", "The government has made an announcement on this issue. We are left with the case that there could yet be systemic problems with neonicotinoids, and from our party’s position, we’re not going to stand here and say, “Well, that can’t be,” because there very well could be systemic problems with neonicotinoids.", "I’d like to back up a step to where these problems actually started. I’m going to go back even before neonicotinoids.", "Over the years, agriculture has evolved and we’ve changed. I remember when I started farming, I mouldboard-plowed everything. Then that was a no-no because, “We need conservation tillage,” so we went to conservation tillage. Then we went to no-till. No-till doesn’t really work well in my area, so we went back to conservation tillage. So we made lots of changes.", "When I started farming, there was lots of public research to help you. Over the years, the government has backed away from public research, and companies have taken up the slack. I don’t blame them. I really don’t. The federal government, I think, has been guiltier of trying to push science away and trying to push it to other people, but the province, as well, has backed off considerably on agricultural research. As a result, all the research that was done was private, by private companies who are out to make money, as I was when I farmed.", "It’s no surprise that farmers use a lot of chemical products for insurance. That’s basically what neonicotinoids are. Some areas of farmland need them; some crops need them. Not all crops need them. But no one was actually paying for the research to see exactly where they were needed. That’s one thing the government should be doing now. If you’re serious that there are some places that don’t need neonicotinoids, help us find ways to actually test accurately, to know when and where.", "Where that comes back to the crop insurance issue is, if you’re going to restrict the use of something that is used everywhere else, there are going to be yield impacts, and they’re not going to be divided—the yield impacts aren’t going to be the same all over. Some farms are going to be hit much harder than others. Some crops are going to be hit much harder than others. That’s going to impact their crop insurance. So if your crop goes down because you can’t use a chemical, then you’ll get a payout for one year, maybe, but you won’t the second year, and your premium is going to go way up.", "Where that’s even a bigger problem—fields are fairly big now. At least in my part of the world, they’re fairly big, and they are not that uniform. So you could have three or four different types of soil on the same farm. One type of soil might be more prone to soil-borne insects than another type of soil. So to say that we can’t use something because—how do you do that? If you have a 100-acre field and 20 acres in the middle of it needs protection from wireworm or whatever and the rest doesn’t, how do you get around that?", "I know how I got around it on my farm. I didn’t have a big farm. I farmed about 500 acres. On my final 500-acre farm, I had 300 acres, of which I have about 250 left: beautiful soil, the kind of soil where after it rains, you could still go on there and not make mud. Just beautiful soil. But in the middle of that farm there were 40 acres of the clay like they made the pyramids from. It didn’t matter what you did, that soil was always ready two weeks later, and if you touched that soil a day before it was ready, all you had was parking lot.", "I was a smaller farmer. My bigger cash crop neighbours around me kind of laughed, but I had a 100-acre field that was split into two triangles and a straight stretch in the middle. I did that was because, as a smaller farmer, I could compensate for that. But bigger places can’t. They can’t come back and make those changes, and that’s something we have to realize. Those are just a couple of examples.", "The government has made this announcement of an aspirational goal—and in this case, I like the word “aspirational.” Most times I get a little bit leery from the word “aspirational,” but this time I hope they truly mean that, because the agricultural sector really wants to work. It’s not in a farmer’s best interest to destroy the environment. It’s not in a farmer’s best interest to destroy the soil. It’s not in a farmer’s best interest to hurt other species of animals. But a farmer needs the tools to operate his farm profitably, and if the government is going to take those tools away, then the government has to take steps so that the farmer can still compete with other areas, because otherwise the base of the agricultural sector on which this province depends won’t be healthy and we won’t be able to create all those jobs.", "It gets even trickier when the province is making pronouncements on things that are actually a federal responsibility, so then some of our provincial counterparts, which farmers have to compete against, will have access to products that we won’t have access to. In effect, you’re creating an island, and when you create an island—I have a cottage on a lake and I have friends who have a cottage on that lake, but they’re on an island. Everything is harder to get to the island. When you create an agricultural island, it becomes more difficult. That’s the government’s decision to make, but the government has to realize the ramifications of creating that island. You have to step up to the plate if you’re going to do that, and crop insurance is one place where that will rear its head.", "If we can look ahead on the neonicotinoid file, we need to spend a lot of research and time—public research—to find ways where we can test where we need it and where we don’t. It’s really important. We can’t just say, “We have to use ‘this much less’,” and that’s it.", "I’ll give the government credit; there is no aspirational target on canola because canola really needs it. I grew canola for a long time and before neonicotinoids we used organophosphates to kill the bugs, and organophosphates were way more dangerous. They were dangerous to use.", "That’s something else that you have to realize: If you don’t look at the whole picture, you can ban one thing but you have to make sure that you know what’s going to replace it, because some of these crops aren’t going to grow without those tools. You have to look at the whole picture and I really hope that on this issue the government takes the time to actually listen to farmers and work with farmers for the long term, and to their credit, on the acute problem we have with neonicotinoids, I think the government recognizes the work that the farmers have done, and I hope that they will continue to work with agriculture. But they’re going to have to realize that to really come up with viable tools so we can produce using fewer pesticides, we’re going to need research dollars and we’re going to need public research. I don’t see why anybody is surprised, when you leave all the research to the people who make the chemicals—if you expect them to do the research—that you don’t end up using more chemicals. That’s not rocket science.", "Something else: A lot of people bunch the neonicotinoids problem with genetically modified, GMOs, and you can have your own views on GMOs, but actually, because of GMOs, we use a lot less pesticide than we did 20 years ago. The people who want to ban GMOs and ban neonicotinoids—you can have your own views. I perfectly respect people who want to buy organic. I’m not a big believer. I don’t, but if people want to buy organic, it’s perfectly respected.", "There’s a reason that organic should be more expensive, because by and large, you don’t get the yields from organic that you do from—I don’t know what you would call it. The word isn’t “commercial.” What’s the word? When you’re not organic, what are you?" ],

Usually, with organic field crops, you use a lot more fuel, so for the people who want us to use less fuel—when I was a kid, before—what’s the chemical? Roundup. I farmed before there was Roundup, and Roundup kills a lot of things. Roundup is actually a very safe product. It’s safer than table salt; table salt is more poisonous than Roundup.", "Before there was Roundup, our worst weed in my part of the world was quackgrass. Quackgrass is a killer weed. It’s a grass, it’s a perennial, so it’s got miles and miles of roots, and if there’s quackgrass, nothing else grows. Before Roundup, there were all kinds of things we tried, but what my dad did for quackgrass is we’d pick whatever field had the worst quackgrass and we would summer fallow. Summer fallowing is basically you cultivate that field, so you keep it black all summer.", "That was my job. I was a little kid, and I was cultivating that field. So you don’t grow a crop on that field; you just keep it black all summer. You don’t see that anymore, and that’s not really that good for the environment, because you use a lot of diesel fuel. Then, while I was cultivating, you’d have to pull out the cultivator and pull all those quackgrass roots off the cultivator, and you’d have to do this every week, the whole summer. We used all kinds of diesel fuel, and we didn’t really kill the quackgrass either. We just kind of set it back.", "Then Roundup came, and Roundup was a wonder product, but it also has a problem. I can remember when Roundup was first commercialized, when we first started using Roundup—it was expensive back then; I think it was $40 a litre when I started using it. Everybody told us that nothing is ever going to be resistant to Roundup. You know what, Speaker? There are now lots of weeds that are resistant to Roundup. So you have to be careful how you use a product. I think that’s the lesson for neonicotinoids too. You have to be careful how you use a product because if you use it too much, eventually the things you were going to try to control will develop resistance. I’m not a scientist, but I farmed for a long time, and Roundup is my example. When I started, Roundup wasn’t going to have any resistance, and now there are lots of things resistant to Roundup.", "Do we need to do things about neonicotinoids? Yes. Is the government’s announcement the answer? No, not by itself. What we’ve called for—and I think the government is a bit late on this. You need a licence to spray in this province. You have a commercial licence. I have a farmer’s licence to spray in this province, and commercial applicators have a higher level of licence. We could have done this last year: that you need that sprayer licence to be able to handle neonicotinoids. It would have made a big difference, and it would have increased people’s confidence, because not just anybody can use it. It’s a pesticide, so you should be licensed. Most farmers are licensed; not all. That would have been an easy step that we could have done already. Would it have been a big headline? No. But it would have been a step—just like nutrient management plans. They were a huge step." ],

It’s a complicated story, but you don’t have to breed them as often, and you can give them a needle and get a lot more milk. But if you think about it, injecting steroids, basically, into cows—is that good for your milk? Not really. Well, you know what? We never used it in Canada, because we have a unique system to supply milk in Canada—supply management—and Canadian farmers never wanted it. Why? Because they didn’t think that people would accept it. But we didn’t need it because our milk price was protected. We got a fair price for our milk, so there was no desire, because we didn’t really have to compete with milk coming in from other places. As a result, consumers benefited. They benefited not only from a stable supply of milk, but they benefited because they never had to deal with BST. Now they use a lot less BST in the States, too, because people just didn’t like it. So that’s how, if the government does something, you can control what’s used and not used.", "But with neonics it’s different, because the farmers who don’t have access still have to compete with farmers in Quebec, farmers in Manitoba, farmers in Michigan. They are going to be at risk. So the government has got to recognize that and look for ways that we can see where we need it and where we don’t, and look for ways it’s going to impact things like crop insurance. Because for certain farmers, if they don’t have the access and if we put rules in place that actually—because we have a tendency to do that. We have a tendency—the government has a tendency—to put rules in place that sound really good here but don’t work on the ground.", "If we’re going to put stricter controls on neonics, which we agree with, we have to make sure that the programs are in place on the ground to make sure that it can be accurately identified where neonics can be used and can’t, and that in places where neonics can be used, the farmers actually have access. Because when it’s time to plant and you’re going through six months of regulatory process to get the ability to use them—you can’t plant in October. That’s a big issue.", "So can we regulate?

That’s going to be crucial, because we all know what happens when we don’t take the time to develop the programs right.", "One of the things, hopefully, that this bill will change is that we won’t need as many ad hoc programs, because ad hoc programs can be a disaster. I’m sure we have all been contacted by the—I can’t remember the name of their organization, but they’re young pork producers who didn’t qualify for the program when there was the disaster program for pork. They’re very diligent people; I commend them. They’re right—they were starting their careers and they got zippo, and people who were ending their careers got a bunch of money. That’s what happens when you have an ad hoc program, because it’s put together quickly. Because the government is trying to react to a crisis, you make mistakes. Unfortunately, that happened eight years ago, so those mistakes will likely never be remedied. Hopefully this program will make less need for ad hoc programs.", "It’s going to be very important how it’s put together because if you look at the Risk Management Program that was developed by the pork producers and the beef producers, that then was capped by this government. We very well might still have the need for ad hoc programs because if crop prices crash, as they’ve done, and if that stays like that, one sector could very well drain that program and render it basically useless—not useless; useless isn’t the right word.

It’s going to take a commitment from the government to actually fund the research so we know, in a timely manner, where we do and where we don’t need neonics.", "In my final minute, I’d like to reiterate that for any type of crop insurance to be effective in the future, especially with this government—when the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change keeps talking about the huge impacts that’s going to have for agriculture. Well, then, the crop production insurance program in this province has to take that into account, because otherwise, producers are going to bear the brunt and then producers are going to fail.

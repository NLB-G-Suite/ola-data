The proposed Electoral Boundaries Act will help ensure that Ontarians are represented fairly and effectively in the Legislature.", "As members will recall, in June the Premier and I spoke briefly about several proposed measures to reform this province’s elections laws which will strengthen the inclusive society that we are so proud of in this province.", "For more than a decade, this government has demonstrated a firm commitment to ensuring we have a just and fair election system. Taking steps to ensure our election laws are not only up to date, but also progressive, is among the principal ways we have sought to achieve this.", "As many of you will recall, in 2007 we considered a new electoral system for the province. To help provide voters with a say in deciding how their representatives should be elected, we held a referendum on this issue. This is something no other Ontario government has ever done. While the people decided not to proceed with a new system at that time, it was significant that we asked the question and heeded the response.", "Later, in 2010, this assembly passed a bill that included several amendments to make the election process more accessible, convenient and flexible. Some of these measures included creating special ballots for those unable to make it to the polls. To better serve people with disabilities, we also made fully accessible voting locations a requirement. Shortly after, in the wake of the robocall scam during the 2011 federal election, we introduced steep fines and jail time for those committing election fraud. Clearly, our record shows that our commitment to maintaining a democratic electoral system has been unwavering.", "I would now like to take this opportunity to tell the members in detail about the Electoral Boundaries Act, which we are proposing to help Ontarians continue to have a strong voice and effective representation at Queen’s Park. Following this, I will also explain a number of other measures that our government is considering to encourage greater public participation in the electoral process.", "The legislation we are discussing today would build upon our government’s work to strengthen Ontario’s election system by ensuring that provincial ridings better reflect population movement and growth. If passed, the Electoral Boundaries Act would create 15 new ridings in southern Ontario. This adjustment will align with the federal electoral boundaries for southern Ontario that were put in place last year. Increasing the number of ridings in these areas will help ensure that this Legislature can better reflect the interests of these wonderfully diverse and flourishing regions. This is about representation by population, a core democratic principle.", "We need to ensure that there is appropriate political representation in all parts of the province. Of course, the unique needs of communities in northern Ontario were an important consideration when we drafted this legislation. In 2005, our government made a commitment to support effective political representation in the North, and we intend to keep that promise. As a result, the 11 ridings in northern Ontario would stay the same, to ensure that northern communities continue to have effective representation in the Legislature.", "I would like to take this opportunity to tell the members about a few additional measures we are considering to strengthen our election system and to continue our legacy of progress and responsiveness to the changing needs and expectations of our citizens.", "When we introduced the Electoral Boundaries Act, we also said we would move forward on other reforms, including the following: We will introduce rules that would allow the provisional registration of 16- and 17-year-olds. While the actual voting age would remain at 18, provisional registration could potentially allow for more meaningful engagement of young people. Later, when they turn 18, these young voters would begin receiving the same voter information as other adults on the electoral rolls. My hope is that they will be a bit more informed about the electoral process and a bit more likely to go to the polls than they otherwise would have been.", "Finally, we will tackle the issue of third-party advertising. Ontario currently has rules in place to ensure transparency and free speech in our election campaigns. Third-party advertising rules were introduced in Ontario for the first time in 2007. Currently, third parties that spend $500 or more on election advertising are required to register with the Chief Electoral Officer. They must also report to the Chief Electoral Officer on election advertising expenses. If election advertising expenses are $5,000 or more, these reports must be audited.", "As members may recall, in the most recent budget our government committed to strengthening the province’s rules around election-related, third-party advertising. This will help ensure that we continue to protect the public interest. Informed by the Chief Electoral Officer’s report on the 2014 general election, we are now considering options for moving forward.", "I think we can all agree that we believe in a just and fair society, a society that is inclusive and democratic. We know the importance of giving citizens the tools and resources they need to meaningfully participate in society. But Mr. Speaker, maintaining a democratic society does not just mean having a government that is willing to listen to what its people have to say; it must be willing to give people a megaphone through which to speak.", "By adjusting electoral boundaries in southern Ontario and pursuing a number of other innovative, progressive electoral reforms, the proposed measures would help us build on the momentum our government has generated over the years.", "I urge all members to support our proposed legislation for a stronger and more inclusive Ontario." ],

Strengthening third-party advertising rules and undertaking provisional registration of 16- and 17-year-olds are just two of the innovations he suggested. He also made a number of excellent recommendations that our government has been considering since receiving his report earlier this year.", "As the Attorney General explained, the focus of the bill before us today is about ensuring that provincial ridings better reflect population growth and movement. This, of course, responds to another key recommendation of Ontario’s Chief Electoral Officer. As members are aware, over the past decade Ontario’s population has grown rapidly in many areas of the province. This has resulted in a number of ridings with populations that are substantially greater than the provincial average.", "To continue moving Ontario forward, we need to ensure there is appropriate political representation in all parts of the province. So, to ensure fair and appropriate representation of the people living in these areas, the Electoral Boundaries Act would create 15 new ridings in southern Ontario. The change will increase the total riding count in southern Ontario from 96 to 111.", "Most of the new ridings would be in areas that have seen substantial population growth, such as Toronto, Peel, York, Durham and Ottawa, places more people are calling home. It includes Brampton, which has become one of the fastest-growing cities in Canada, and places like Ottawa, where a few years ago the Ottawa-Gatineau population outpaced the country’s national growth.", "The new electoral map would help ensure that this Legislature can better reflect the interests of these diverse and ever-expanding regions. This adjustment would align with the federal electoral boundaries for southern Ontario that were put in place last year. Indeed, a glance at the federal riding map currently in play for the October 19 federal election will allow you to see how our electoral landscape would look for southern Ontario come the next provincial election. These are the 111 ridings that were established through the decennial federal boundaries redistribution process, and the changes from the old map to the new map, including name changes, are the ones that we are proposing to make provincially.", "Of course, that is where the similarity between our two maps ends. As some of the members may recall, in 2004, federal redistribution reduced the number of federal seats in northern Ontario from 11 to 10. We disagreed with that action, which would only serve to weaken northern representation. That would be a step in the wrong direction. That is why, later the following year, our government passed the Representation Act, 2005, which allows Ontario to keep that 11th northern seat. The step was a reflection of our government’s commitment to support effective political representation in the North, and to ensure that people who live in those communities continue to have a strong voice in the provincial Legislature.", "As the Attorney General noted earlier, we fully intend to stand by and honour that promise today. To quote my colleague the Honourable Michael Gravelle, Minister of Northern Development and Mines, “Economically and socially, the North represents a unique and vital part of Ontario.” And so, through this bill, we are reaffirming our government’s commitment to protecting representation in the North.", "Should the Electoral Boundaries Act pass, Ontario will have 122 provincial ridings and 121 federal ridings. It is seemingly small, but it is a significant point of difference and change, one to be proud of.", "Mr. Speaker, should this legislation pass, I should take this opportunity to clarify that the new electoral boundaries I have described wouldn’t come into effect right away, but rather upon the first dissolution of the Legislative Assembly after November 30, 2016. This means that any by-election before the next dissolution of the Legislative Assembly would take place according to Ontario’s current electoral map.", "The legislative measures and other electoral reform proposals that I’ve described here are very exciting. As you know well, Mr. Speaker, we can be a raucous bunch sometimes, so while to me the thought of 15 new members, 15 new colleagues and friends in the House, is quite an exhilarating one, you may want to get a larger mace to keep order, with the new members coming into this Legislature.", "But with great sincerity, I would like to conclude today by once again urging the members to support the government’s electoral boundaries legislation. Each of these measures the Attorney General and I described to you would help reinforce the province’s strong democratic traditions and preserve our most cherished values as Ontarians. Thank you." ],

Speaker, I guess from a public perspective, I can tell you that since those new federal boundaries were established a couple of years ago or better, the common question was, “So is the province going to follow the same direction?” That mostly comes from municipal folks in agencies that we deal with, that we share responsibilities with. There was a time, when I first got elected in 2003, when part of the city of Quinte West belonged to a different riding, and that part made it a little bit confusing, even to the residents. That was certainly one of the most asked questions in the last couple of years: Would we follow this?", "Frankly, since we started talking about this, I’ve been trying to get some unofficial feedback. I mean, I certainly didn’t run any questionnaires or polls or those things, but when the subject comes up, if there’s an interest from the party I’m talking to, I do pop the question, “So are you supportive of this?” The answer is, “Absolutely,” because if they’ve ever had any dealings with our local riding office, and our federal counterpart’s office, it’s always good to have that relationship. And I can say, municipalities were one of the biggest benefactors. I’m also delighted that we’re making a decision to give an additional riding to the North because I did do a little bit of travel—not a lot—up in the North, I must admit. It is a vast piece of geography. Frankly, I don’t know how some of those members do it. So I’m delighted that we’re doing that." ],

I read through it again, and for all the pomp and circumstance she made about fixing third-party advertising, there’s not one lick of evidence in here that they’re changing anything with regard to third-party advertising. I have no idea why she even commented on it when it has nothing to do with the bill.", "It’s quite disappointing considering how warped the system has become due to third-party advertising. They had their opportunity. They have this bill in front of us. They could have easily added it in. They didn’t have to do any work to create this bill because the federal government did all the work for the last few years. They just mimicked what the federal government did, fixed what’s going on in the North and implemented the bill. There is no work on their side of the House on this bill. So at the very least, they could have stepped forward and put their considerations into written paper and discussed how we could amend third-party advertising and make it fair for the people of Ontario. But they’ve missed this, and I don’t understand why they talked about it if they’re not even going to do anything about it. It’s more bafflegab and bloviation as opposed to actually implementing what we can go forward with.", "The other aspect which I thought was very interesting: They want to start collecting data and let 16- and 17-year-olds register, so they could have their name and help promote—I’m all for letting more voters occur in our government. However, I think a better option would be maybe looking at our school system, how we can fix the curriculum so that our kids, our children, our youth get a better education of how the system of government works and operates in this province. Even adults today don’t have an understanding of the importance of voting, let alone how governments and elections operate. So maybe fixing the educational process would lend credence to continuing on with improving the voter turnout, especially in our youth." ],

We’ll be listening to what the opposition has to say: the comments from both the Conservative Party and the NDP and what they propose should happen. We have listened to the public. We’ll also listen here in the Legislature and we’ll listen when it goes to committee, because that’s when we invite the public to come in and listen to what they have to say and make submissions that may or may not change the bill.", "The Attorney General has laid out a very simple strategy for changing the ridings, to bring it up to 122 members. That’s an increase—because presently we have 107 members—of 15 members in this House. That’s more representation. We all know that the population in Ontario has grown quite a bit, especially in some of the major cities—Toronto and Ottawa—and other areas of Ontario where the population has also increased. We are following what the federal government is doing. We are keeping one extra seat up north.", "The main thing is to hear from the public, finish this debate, send it to committee, and then come back here for third reading and get this into law as soon as possible.", "It’s a very important bill. I think it allows for more public participation, with more members representing various parts of the province here in Ontario.", "I look forward to more debate, and I’ll be listening very carefully." ],

It modifies three different pieces of legislation.", "I’ll be sharing my time with the honourable member from Kitchener–Conestoga, Mr. Harris, for this leadoff debate.", "By and large, we’re very much in agreement with this bill. Bill 115 does what many of us have long wanted the government to initiate: to keep those electoral districts aligned with our federal counterparts for the province of Ontario. I think it was a smart move when it was first implemented back in the 1990s under the Mike Harris government, where we mirrored the provincial ridings with the federal ridings. It has worked well. In my own situation, I can say that it certainly has helped individuals understand the levels of government, helped individuals understand what the different jurisdictions are, because there is not that confusion of overlapping, as the member from the third party mentioned in his discussion of sharing the same riding with three federal counterparts. It can add complexity and confusion for people. So we’re glad to see that this happens.", "The basis of it, of course, is that all votes ought to be equal in influence in a representative democracy. We can see, at the present time, that our electoral districts have populations anywhere from 50,000 up to 150,000 registered voters. When you compare those two numbers, with some ridings as low as 50,000 and others up to 150,000, you can inherently see the unfairness in that. People who live in those very heavily populated ridings—their vote is not worth as much or as influential as much as people with lower numbers. The baseline is an acceptable baseline number, where the government is looking to achieve about 100,000 voters in each riding—in every electoral district. Although it’s certainly unable to achieve that perfectly, it comes very close to achieving it, with the exception of our 11 ridings in northern Ontario, where geography just doesn’t allow for effective representation, in my view, of 100,000 constituents in such sparsely populated and diverse geography.", "I do want to mention that the government is revising three statutes: the Election Finances Act, the Legislative Assembly Act, as well as the Representation Act. Part of this bill, as we heard from the Attorney General and her parliamentary assistant, is to address inadequacies in our representation. We know that in the 2011 election, for the very first time in a general election, we had less than 50% of the people vote. I think we got up to 54% in the 2014 election—pretty dismal numbers. Nearly half the people of Ontario don’t find any value in voting and sometimes greater than half the voters don’t see any value. I do think this is a missed opportunity to alter these statutes by the Attorney General, and she could do a far more effective job in helping to address those dismal voter participation numbers.", "As our health critic said, there is clearly a lack of interest placed on education in our province; of helping to educate our youth in understanding their role in a representative democracy, as well as the role of elected representatives. This was an opportunity that clearly could have been undertaken, if the Attorney General really was serious and had a commitment to improving voter participation.", "This role of auditing—she mentioned changes to third-party advertising. Maybe if I could get the parliamentary assistant or the minister to listen for a minute—I would like this answered in the debates—where does this auditing of third-party expenditures over $5,000 appear? I haven’t seen it in the bill. It could very well be a proposed regulatory change, but I haven’t seen it in the bill. It doesn’t appear. It wouldn’t surprise me if this government would make a regulatory change, because of course it doesn’t require any discussion or debate in this House when they do a regulatory change.", "There were comments about taking the Chief Electoral Officer’s recommendations. I’m going to advance to the parliamentary assistant—he seems to be a little bit more interested in hearing this debate—that having a permanent voter ID would be a great thing to do. If we’re going to amend these acts, let’s look at having a permanent voter ID. Every member here who has been involved in a campaign—and we all have—knows the confusion, the troubles and the problems with our voters lists because our voters lists are taken from MPAC records. Whenever people move, change locations or whatever, it causes significant difficulties. We always see people who are missed on voters lists, whose poll locations in rural Ontario are sent hours away. A permanent voter ID would be an effective mechanism to help solve that problem.", "I had one person the other day—and this is of course with the federal election—who dropped in to see me because their voting location is 45 minutes away from their home in rural Ontario. They actually have to drive past three other polling stations to get to the one that has been identified for them—45 minutes one way, 45 minutes back. If we want to improve voter participation, let’s improve our lists, and having a permanent voter ID would be a significant way of achieving that.", "I think also, when we’re talking about improving the integrity of our act, improving voter participation, our elections have come into very significant disrepute as of late with the by-election in Sudbury. We’re amending the Ontario Legislative Assembly Act. While we’re doing that, we could clearly improve the language in that act to prevent wrongdoing from happening and put very clear language as to what would be a breach of the Ontario Election Act when it comes to offering inducements and other favours when it comes to by-elections such as what has happened in Sudbury.", "I think it’s also important, while we’re addressing that Legislative Assembly Act, that there has been a host of motions introduced in this House over the years to improve our representative democracy. If anybody on the Liberal side cares to pick up the orders and notices paper today, you’ll see a whole series of motions in there. They’ve actually been in there for a couple of years. They were first introduced in the previous Parliament before the minority Parliament fell. I know they’re there because a number of them are mine, and they’re all to do with modifications to our standing orders and the Legislative Assembly Act, to improve representation in this House.", "I could read a few of them. To ensure that regulations do not make unusual or unexpected delegations of power—that motion, motion number 39, was passed by the regulations and private bills committee back in 2013, and it still languishes on the Orders and Notices paper two years later—passed, adopted by one of our standing committees of the House, and nothing has happened. I’m not going to read them all, Speaker, but I do encourage members on the other side to take a look at some of those motions.", "Another one that this House has struggled with is the motion to allow electronic petitions to be delivered in this House. There are members in this House who are on that committee, who heard hours and hours and hours of agonizing discussion and debate over electronic petitions. I see the member from Newmarket–Aurora who was in that committee. We heard from expert witnesses, but indeed the government continues to fail the people of this province by preventing people from using technology to be engaged with their representatives and to be engaged with this Legislative Assembly.", "There are 20 or 30 motions that have been tabled in this House. Many of them have been adopted and approved by standing committees, but still this government refuses to take action.", "Also, Speaker, they’re opening up the Election Finances Act—and thankfully; it’s very important. Again, I hope that the parliamentary assistant will provide information to us about where this auditing mechanism is included in the bill.", "But what about not just mirroring our electoral riding associations with the federal government; how about mirroring our election financing laws? As we know, in the federal government, only individuals can contribute to campaigns and to candidates. Businesses and unions are prevented from using their money to influence a federal campaign.", "That’s not the case here in Ontario, of course. In Ontario, we’re just about the Wild West when it comes to allowing unions and businesses—and individuals, as well—to use their financial domination, their financial positions, to influence our actions in this Legislature. Tens of thousands of dollars can easily be funnelled to any candidate or any party at any time under our election financing rules in this province.", "If the government really and truly had conviction and commitment to improving representation, that would be one of the first, if not foremost, amendments that they would do in the Election Finances Act, which is being amended by this legislation. I think it is reasonable, it is simple, it is practical and it is consistent with our understanding that our assembly, our Parliament, is for the people. We are here to represent people, not businesses, corporations and unions that have significant amounts of financial resources to use to influence legislation and public policy.", "For that matter, I’ll speak shortly, briefly, about the recall amendment act that I introduced. Again, if we had a truly honest conviction to improving representation, openness and accountability—every Liberal member spoke out against and voted against a bill in this House two weeks ago that would have allowed people to initiate a recall process. That was struck down.", "Referendums: That’s not part of this bill. It’s not part of the discussion. This Liberal government has cherry-picked one element of federal jurisdiction, the riding redistribution, and has promoted it as the big safeguard, to demonstrate how big their hearts are and what a commitment they have to representative democracy. They’ve cherry-picked one element. It’s an important one, one that I agree with, but there’s far, far more that could be done if we truly wanted to see more than under half the people actually vote.", "That’s a condemnation on all of us in this House, in my view. When we have a general election, and nearly half the people say it’s not worth getting off the couch to go and vote, that’s a condemnation on us. It’s a condemnation on this House that so many people see so little value in us. And it’s not going to change by us doing the same things. We’re not doing anything different. That trend line has been happening for a number of decades now. One day, we need to wake up. I would have thought it would have been in 2011, when for the first time in our history, more people stayed at home on the couch than bothered to go out to vote. That was a wake-up call, I think, or should have been a wake-up call to all of us. It should have been a clarion call to action for all members of this House when we saw those numbers.", "Recall, referendums, election financing reform, improving the integrity of our Election Act with better language, improving education of our youth in both elementary and secondary schools—I have gone to a number of classes to do civics classes in my community, and it is astonishing just how little effort is put forth in our education system to explain the value, the purpose and the responsibilities of elected members.", "I will say that we’re all here to safeguard that public interest. We safeguard the public interest by our debate and by our discussions. We do that by representing this very diverse—both geographically and demographically—province. It is important, it is essential, that the members in this House represent their constituents in their areas in the most forthright manner they can, but also by having the most effective and practical tools at our disposal to do so, such as those motions to amend the standing orders, motions such as allowing petitions and allowing regulations to be scrutinized, analyzed and evaluated by all members in this House.", "In closing, I want to say to the Attorney General: I am glad you have done it, this bill. It’s unfortunate you only did a little sliver of things that need to be done. I do think most members in this House will agree that there are failings, there are faults in our system, and that they could and can be corrected in a non-partisan fashion, with agreement, if they chose to, if they thought it was important, if they thought the desires and wishes of their constituents were more important than just the edicts from the corner office. If we did that, we would make this House a far more effective House, a far more valuable House, a House such that maybe more than 50% of the people would find value in going out and legitimizing our office.", "I think those are important considerations. I do hope the Attorney General and the parliamentary assistant have listened and will take those words. Those words are offered in sincerity. They are offered with honesty, not in a partisan fashion. Permanent voters’ ID would save people a lot of grief. It would also save all of us a lot of grief every campaign, as well, but more importantly, it would save people a lot of grief. And I am going to listen for the parliamentary assistant to offer up that information, so we can see where this auditing process comes in with this bill.", "With that, I’m going to turn it over to the member from Kitchener–Conestoga." ],

I have had the opportunity to catch the leadoff—the short leadoff that it was—from the government on Bill 115, and, of course, the comments from our critic the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington. A major interest of his is electoral reform, democracy, ensuring that Ontarians get all sorts of abilities to have their say when necessary. As the member did refer just a few weeks ago, the member put forward a recall bill that many of us supported here; unfortunately, the government didn’t, perhaps for self-interest, I would say.", "Nevertheless, the Electoral Boundaries Act, 2015, an act that, as we have heard, will, if passed, enact the Representation Act, 2015, while repealing the Representation Act, 2005, and amending the Election Finances Act and the Legislative Assembly Act, for those who didn’t already know—specifically, this bill will help Ontario move towards shifting electoral boundaries set in recent years by the federal government in Ottawa in response to population shifts and growth throughout the nation.", "The redrawn federal election map has changed approximately 87% of federal ridings. A number of them are in my area. Certainly, as we have seen over the years, when the feds redraw, it’s time for legislators in Ontario to get out their boundary markers to follow suit. Federal decisions to readjust boundaries aren’t taken lightly and are a direct response to shifts in population that our nation experiences over years and decades of growth.", "Quite simply, the readjustments are based on criteria aimed at ensuring population equality so that the population of an electoral district in a given province comes as close as possible to the average population size of a district for that province. In addition, there are a few other considerations that go into the decision-making around where the lines are to be drawn, including the application of special clauses as well as the representation rule. Special clauses go into effect after the initial number of seats per province is obtained, allowing for adjustments to be made to account for the senatorial clause and the grandfather clause.", "The senatorial clause guarantees that no province has fewer seats in the House of Commons than it has in the Senate, while the grandfather clause guarantees that each province will have no fewer seats than it had in 1985. As I noted earlier, the final step is the application of the representation rule, which only applies to a province whose population was overrepresented in the House of Commons at the completion of the last redistribution process. In cases where such a province would be under-represented based on the previous calculations, it will be given extra seats so that its share of the House of Common seats is proportional to its share of the population. For those at home, I’m hoping you’re following along with that. That’s about it, Speaker.", "When all was said and done, following the last federal adjustment that we are looking to mirror, it meant 15 new ridings and adjustments to many more. It meant that Ontario will now boast 121 members on Parliament Hill, which comes in at approximately 36% of the total representation in Ottawa.", "In my area, the federal changes and, by extension, the related provincial changes that this bill calls for today created a lot of shifting, including two specific new ridings—or rather, one with some new names: Kitchener South–Hespeler and Waterloo—as well as small adjustments to their new neighbours.", "Here’s how the boundaries break down for the people in Waterloo region. I’ll begin with one of the two new ridings that take in part of my current riding of Kitchener–Conestoga. The new riding of Kitchener South–Hespeler encompasses the south end of Kitchener as well as the north end of Cambridge. It is made up of chunks from the ridings of Kitchener–Conestoga, Cambridge and a small piece from Kitchener Centre. Specifically, it will mean a larger urban riding created from a riding that I’ve been proud to serve and represent, encompassing both rural and urban areas. The rural areas and townships will remain as Kitchener–Conestoga, as Kitchener South–Hespeler encompasses the urban centre shared between Kitchener and Cambridge. Further, the changes mean the creation of a younger riding whose median age of 36 is the lowest in Ontario outside the GTA.", "For those familiar with the area, the new riding is bounded by Highway 401 and New Dundee Road to the south, Fischer-Hallman Road to the west, the Conestoga Parkway, King Street bypass and Fairway Road to the north, and the Waterloo region’s eastern boundaries to the east.", "Our other new federal riding is now known as Waterloo. It’s a riding previously known as Kitchener–Waterloo that has been shrunk slightly on the south end of its border.", "Other changes that the province is looking to mirror with Bill 115 include some small adjustments to Kitchener Centre and Cambridge. Kitchener Centre, which has long encompassed most of central Kitchener, would shrink slightly from the west and south ends and grow slightly to the north. Kitchener–Conestoga, which I represent and referenced earlier, would continue to encompass much of Waterloo region’s rural townships, but as I mentioned earlier, would shrink to accommodate Kitchener South–Hespeler. At the same time, Kitchener–Conestoga would expand slightly into Kitchener Centre and Waterloo’s former western territory.", "Finally, Speaker, Cambridge, which covers Cambridge south of Highway 401 and the township of North Dumfries, would expand south into the county of Brant while losing a north end to Kitchener South–Hespeler.", "With regard to the shifts in Cambridge, I will say that not all changes come without some controversy. It does seem that the new Kitchener South–Hespeler has opened up some old wounds in Cambridge when it comes to historical names. Former ward 4 Cambridge city councillor Ben Tucci said the new federal riding and what we are proposing here for the new provincial riding have an alienating name that may affect voter turnout. Those familiar with the area will know of the history surrounding the marriage of Hespeler, Preston and Galt to create the municipality we now know as Cambridge. Tucci noted when the changes were first proposed that, “We’ve been attempting now for many years to get over this Hespeler-Preston-Galt mentality.", "“Moves like this tend to alienate people and the public and I wouldn’t be surprised if that section of our city has a low voter turnout.” He suggested a new Kitchener South–Cambridge North—maybe next time around, Speaker.", "When it comes down to it, redistribution and riding boundary shifts are all about improving and strengthening our democracy. It’s about making sure that government is working at all times to do what it can to maintain the truest representation of the people that our democratic system is meant to serve. Whether it’s considering changes to the first-past-the-post system, as have been proposed by many over the years—including reference by the Attorney General in her leadoff that in 2007 it was taken to the people in a referendum and clearly they spoke that they would want the status quo—changing boundaries, or working to ensure the say of the people takes precedence over government dictates, we must always ensure that the cornerstones of our democratic system hold strong.", "It is these principles that spurred me to raise my voice locally when it came to Waterloo region’s consideration of options to deal with a seat vacancy that followed the passing of regional councillor and former Ontario MPP Wayne Wettlaufer. While the decision-making did not encompass any boundary riding changes, the principles of democracy that I discussed at that time are the very same principles at the heart of the decision-making we are considering today.", "As a two-term MPP, Wayne Wettlaufer left behind a strong legacy as an accountable representative, advocate of community engagement and defender of democracy. Unfortunately, we lost Wayne Wettlaufer this past summer. We remember Wayne not only in the community of the region of Waterloo, his riding of Kitchener Centre here in the Legislature—of course, Wayne was a strong advocate for German pioneers in the region of Waterloo, enacting a bill to actually recognize German Pioneers Day. We’ll be celebrating that in the coming weeks as Kitchener-Waterloo hosts Kitchener-Waterloo’s Oktoberfest. I think it will be extra special this year for sure.", "But much as Wayne himself indicated in the Ontario Legislature back on June 25, 2001, “We cannot be democratic if we do not give people a choice,” it’s clear that without choice there is no democracy. It was that point that I felt was key to the local decision or discussion on the region’s vacancy. It is also key to our discussions today, as we work to ensure that people are given that choice in a way that best reflects the will of the people in our many diverse areas and ridings across Ontario and across Canada.", "With regard to the municipal decision, I continue to feel it is essential, going forward, as both the Municipal Act and the Municipal Elections Act have been opened up for review, that the province give better direction on council vacancy rules. The province must always work to ensure that when the decision is between the elected council dictating through appointment versus allowing the electorate the democratic freedom of choice, the right to vote for our representatives remains paramount.", "Of course, if we took the same situation of seat vacancy from a provincial or federal perspective, there would be an outcry at the offence to the democratic process should Queen’s Park or Ottawa suggest appointing a non-elected member. I think the question has to be asked as to why the same principle shouldn’t hold true within municipalities. We will have to wait and see whether that question will be answered and democracy is served in the ongoing municipal review.", "Today we will work to ensure that questions surrounding representation and boundary shifts are answered through the lens of upholding the principles of democracy that we are all here to serve. I think most of us here today can agree that Bill 115 does that by reflecting growth, declines and population shifts so that MPPs bear an equal representation as they work on behalf of the people of Ontario.", "Now, as we are all aware, we are actually in an election federally—election 42, I believe. Voters will be subject to those boundaries on October 19. And I can tell you, Speaker, as I’m sure many MPPs have, that speaking to constituents, they’re frequently getting asked questions about the fact that they were unaware that the boundaries had changed. I know that our federal cousins are out campaigning now. In some areas, they believe they’re voting to re-elect their current incumbent, and in fact they’re going to have four to five to six new names on the ballot this time around.", "So I think it’s imperative, as we go through this process—obviously Ontario will have an example to follow in October, but it’s of course up to the government to educate voters that come 2018—it can’t come soon enough—the boundaries will reflect the new boundaries set out federally and those ridings per se in my region of Waterloo will remain just about the same.", "I know there are some differences in the north, as my colleague recently stated. If there weren’t, his electoral district wouldn’t exist. So there are a few changes, obviously, but I think it goes to the point that the government needs to make a strong effort to educate people leading up to the 2018 election. Maybe they can run a few non-partisan commercials leading into the next election to tout something instead of their own, perhaps, political agenda.", "Before I finish up here, I would remind members that while we are considering the benefits of boundary change, the decisions we are contemplating trace their roots back to the origins of this country. Ever since the conception of Upper and Lower Canada, we have had debates and considerations over how and where to draw boundaries and create ridings to ensure the best system of representation right across our nation.", "I recall when the commission was set up to review the boundaries for the upcoming election. There were several models that lumped townships like Wilmot and Wellesley with Stratford areas. You know what? We had Cambridge lumped in with Brant. But, reflecting the growth of the Waterloo region, I think they’ve got the best geographical lines drawn out. Of course there are some concerns down in Cambridge, with Hespeler as part of the new riding name.", "One quick fact: My current riding is Kitchener–Conestoga and yet one of the communities I represent is actually Conestogo. Of course, I am sure they’re referring to the old Conestoga wagon. But just a little bit of a fun fact for folks today that, although my riding name is Kitchener–Conestoga, I have a small community in my riding, Conestogo, which is spelled with an O, not an A.", "The Fathers of Confederation, in 1867, spent much time and effort—and a lot of debate—over how to create equal representation in the House of Commons of Canada, time guaranteeing that each region of the country had a fair say in the daily workings of the new federation. The idea of representation by population meant each province was allotted a number of seats that directly corresponded to its proportion of the total population in relation to Quebec’s. It was around this principle that the formula of distributing the number of seats in the House of Commons among the provinces was originally designed.", "Of course, with growth, as we see today, came more questions as to how to guarantee the best representation for the people of all provinces and territories. As more provinces entered Confederation and as some regions grew and developed more than others, a certain degree of compromise had to be built into the formula. Again, it is the centuries-old legacy from the decisions and discussions that have been taken on by representatives across Canada in the years since 1867 that brings us to the considerations we are debating today as put forward by the Electoral Boundaries Act, 2015.", "While it is a historical debate and one that will be repeated in the future as our country grows and populations shift, I feel it is important that we work to move this specific debate forward as government proposes to follow the new federal map to improve democracy across Ontario, as it has across Canada.", "I’ll finish my remarks at that. For those in attendances today and those watching at home, I encourage all to come out on October 19 and have their democratic say and vote." ],

It sounds like it’s doing a lot, Mr. Speaker.", "To some of the points made by the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington and the member from Kitchener–Conestoga, this is a proposal that’s going to change boundaries to match the federal boundaries, with a few exceptions in our ridings up north. I think one of the positive things that’s going to come out of this, hopefully, is to minimize some confusion. We want to engage our constituents. We want to engage our friends and neighbours and make sure that they are voting, that they are engaging in our democratic process.", "To that point of confusion: I’ll tell you, Mr. Speaker, when I ran in the last provincial election, the boundaries of my Oshawa riding were just so, and that was my riding. Now we find ourselves, as you may have heard, in a federal election. In this federal election, of course, the boundaries are different. Well, coming up—and it will be determined, soon I suppose, when the by-election for my neighbouring riding Whitby–Oshawa is going to happen. Those individuals who live in the Whitby–Oshawa riding—that section of Oshawa that has come back to Oshawa federally—will be voting in the Oshawa boundaries federally. Then they’re going to be back in the Whitby–Oshawa boundaries provincially, and then they’re going to switch, we’ll see, in the next provincial—if I’ve confused you, imagine how our voters are feeling.", "I think that this really does come down to improving representation, and we’re glad that there will be some help towards that." ],

My neighbour here from Trinity–Spadina could tell you: On every corner of his riding, there’s a condominium. Maybe about 2,000 to 5,000 people live in one building. Just in one building alone there are probably thousands of potential voters.", "With regard to this proposed legislation, if passed, there will be additional members of this chamber, but more importantly, it will provide fair representation and make sure there will be more inclusiveness of representation.

Of course, we’ve had a population increase in Ontario, so the number of ridings will be going up by some 15 ridings. As was pointed out by the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington, it was Mike Harris, back in 1999, that made the Ontario provincial ridings match the federal ridings. That is fairly unique in the country.", "I want to get to one point that the member made that I thought was a really good idea, and that’s the idea of having a permanent voter ID card or a permanent voter list. I think we have all experienced at election time that the lists are just—generally, they’re a mess. If you happen to go walk up to a house on the street, there are usually eight names listed and two that might actually be living in that particular residence. I think it is a good idea, especially with the point the member was making with regard to trying to increase voter turnout. He pointed out that less than 50% of people actually voted in the last election. I think that’s an idea that has merit and should be considered—some sort of voter ID card or permanent voter ID. Perhaps it would be the individual’s responsibility, as it is with your driver’s licence: If you switch residences, you change your voter ID card and just keep it up to date. It would probably be a lot more accurate that way.", "I can see, Mr. Speaker, that I’m out of time, so I won’t make the other points I wanted to make." ],

One got a card to vote in one riding, and the other, living in the same house, got a card from the other riding. They called the Elections Canada office and they were told, “Well, where you live it’s kind of murky, so just pick where you want to vote.” In this riding, in the last federal election, the difference between first and second was 18 votes, yet these people are told that it’s kind of murky.

As people who have the privilege to sit in this House, we perhaps look on it differently because we deal with politics on a daily basis. We deal with the results of elections on a daily basis in a much more hands-on manner. But for people whose interaction with politics and with democracy is voting, it comes in short bursts—sometimes too long a burst, but short bursts every three or four years. And so I tried to, as I was thinking about the comments on this bill—and the majority of this bill is about changing boundaries, and we’re in favour; we’re not going to say we’re not in favour—to look at this from the point of view of the voter.", "Firstly, I’m going to focus on my own riding for a few minutes. In northern Ontario, the ridings don’t follow the federal boundaries. There’s a good reason: Because people deal with provincial issues much more than federal issues, I find—I think we all find. So as ridings get bigger and bigger, it’s harder and harder to actually serve the public. To their credit, the government of the day decided to hold the number of ridings in northern Ontario at 11. We agree with that. We fully support keeping it at 11. We’d like to put it up to 20, but we realize that the population doesn’t merit that.", "Just to clarify how things work in our part of the world—and I listened to some of the comments from the government’s side about how a member had 250,000 people in their riding; and that is an incredible responsibility. If you take a riding like mine, I have about 70,000. I live in the centre of my riding, and I have five towns, five communities of interest; and to get to the northernmost, it’s three hours, and to get to the southernmost, it’s three hours. There is no public transportation, so it’s very hard. A lot of these people don’t even have Internet. It’s very hard. So it’s not the number. Again, I’m not downplaying the number, but you have to look at both sides, and that’s why it’s good that we’re keeping some northern ridings.", "I would like to suggest that as I read—and it’s not often that Timiskaming–Cochrane gets mentioned in a bill specifically, but in this one, because it’s riding boundaries, of course it gets mentioned specifically. It lays out the boundaries of Timiskaming–Cochrane. I had the opportunity this morning to talk to the member for Nipissing, who shares a boundary with me, and the member for Nickel Belt, who also shares a boundary with me. We would like to make some changes, from a voter perspective.", "My riding kind of wishbones around North Bay. I have two small villages in my riding, Thorne and Eldee. We do our best to serve Thorne and Eldee, but the only way that they can get to my constituency office is to either drive through Quebec or drive right past the member for Nipissing’s constituency office and go another hour to my closest one. Those people are not being served as they should. Their community of interest is not in Timiskaming–Cochrane. Their community of interest is in Nipissing. We do our best to service them, and I’m sure the member from Nipissing also services them, because that’s the way we are in northern Ontario. Lots of times between elections, parties don’t really mean a lot. People want service and we try to provide it. But the people in Thorne and Eldee would be better served if they were in the riding of Nipissing; that is their community of interest. That could be done here.", "Another one would be, on the other side of my riding, the Wahnapitae First Nation. They’re on the other side of Lake Wanapitei. I have to drive through, again, another riding to get there, but so do they. Actually, we were talking to the member for Nickel Belt this morning. They are 10 minutes from the member for Nickel Belt’s constituency office and, we calculated this morning, about five hours from mine. Again, if we are going to the time to change the boundaries—and I’m not saying we eliminate; we need the 11. But to serve the people, from the point of view of the people we serve, those two changes would make sense.", "I know them from my riding. I’m sure that changes like that could be made in a lot of places, and I think we should be cognizant—and in this case, in my riding, the roads just don’t exist. When you draw a nice map and on one corner you have got Lake Wanapitei and you just put it on the other side of Lake Wanapitei, there’s no road to get there unless you go through other ridings. In the case of Thorne, the quickest way for me to get there is through another province. Their community of interest—they’re very close to North Bay.", "That’s the first thing that I had to talk about today: that those people would be much better served by the province of Ontario if a couple of small changes were made. That’s the top-of-mind issue for me. As I was reading Bill 115, I thought, “Okay; if my constituents were reading it”—I’m reading on their behalf, but if they were reading it—“what would be the first thing they would say sticks out?” For the people of Thorne and the people of Wanapitei, that’s the first thing that sticks out.", "Something that this bill doesn’t talk a lot about but we need to, while we’re talking about elections, is that we need to fix the voters list. If we’re actually going to have a serious discussion about improving democracy and improving the right to vote, we need to do something about the voters list. A Mr. Johnston came into my office, and he was quite upset because he has lived in the same house for 65 years-plus and voted in the same place. There was a poll there, but he was told to vote someplace else. Again, things like that. We are worried about deterring people from voting, and every time that we do something like that, it, in its own way, deters people from voting.", "In a past federal election, there was the Pierre Poutine robocall scandal.

I think we are going to have to, as the province become more urbanized and as the Legislature becomes more urbanized—which it’s going to become; I don’t think anyone can deny that. That’s what is going to happen. You are going to get more urban representation in the Legislature.", "We have to be very cognizant that the rural voice doesn’t get even more forgotten. In my four years here, my biggest challenge hasn’t been to be able to talk to other MPPs, to be able to talk to ministers—it hasn’t been a challenge. My biggest challenge is being able to get people to understand what happens in rural Ontario, what the differences are. When I go home to talk to people, I explain that, “Well, it would be like us sitting in Tim Hortons in New Liskeard and running Toronto. I think we’d screw it up.” A lot of times, Queen’s Park does the same thing to people in rural Ontario; they don’t understand.", "A lot of times—and I say this over and over and over—we come up with regulations that make sense here and make sense on paper, but they don’t work on the ground. And if the regulations don’t work, then everyone’s kidding themselves. I think that’s something where, as we get more urban representation in the Legislature, the voice of the people of rural Ontario is going to be even more drowned out. That is something we are going to have to be very cognizant of. Somehow, we’re going to have to make some different type of structure to represent rural Ontario or represent northern Ontario, because when there is enough electoral base in one part of the province to control the province continually, it’s not a balanced government. And this isn’t a partisan thing. This isn’t a party thing that I’m talking about right now. I think all parties, if they were in government and had a majority of representation from only one part of the province, would run into that problem.", "So that is something that we’re going to have to be cognizant of. I don’t know; I don’t have any idea how to fix it right now. We proposed a northern committee for MPPs. I think that would be a start: a nonpartisan northern committee to be able to review bills, just to make sure that when the rubber hits the road on the ground, they actually work. Because what you are going to see—and we see it now with some of the farming communities. They are hitting back. On the neonics debate, the government has taken the decision to make that their goal, and that’s their right, but they also have the obligation to make sure that the regulations they implement are going to work, and they haven’t fulfilled that obligation. You haven’t.", "You didn’t fill that with the Endangered Species Act, because a lot of those things actually hurt the species. The intention is not there, but a lot of things work on paper but don’t work unless you really sit down and talk to the people who deal with those issues every day. On neonics, I’ll give you an example. I might get all kinds of people in trouble, but you can ban neonics-treated seed, and what is going to happen is that people are going to spray a lot more neonic spray, and you are actually going to hurt your cause instead of help it.", "Under these regulations—no, I’m going to go back to Bill 115, I think, before the Speaker or somebody else—" ],

Sometimes when something is given to you, you don’t appreciate what you have. For most of us, democracy was given to us. It wasn’t given to our forefathers—it wasn’t. They worked for it. Many died for it. But for the majority of us, it was given to us.

In my first campaign, I had no idea that there were parts of that riding that you couldn’t even get to. Now, that does not make sense. Again, it makes sense in here. It’s a nice line in here: this township, that township, that township. But from a people perspective, it doesn’t make sense, and I think we have to look very strongly from a people perspective. So if we could make a couple of little changes in other ridings, especially in northern ridings—I’m sure it exists all over. We should have a look and see if we can do a couple of non-partisan things that would actually make a big difference in a few people’s lives, and then we will have done our job." ],

But the result of that is that our communities are growing, which means that elected representatives are increasingly, especially in urban and suburban parts of our communities, representing larger and larger groups of people.", "In order to ensure that we have an effective democracy, in order to make sure that we have effective representation by representatives who are elected on behalf of their communities, we need to make sure that those communities are manageable so that we can do the work in a manner that ensures that our constituents are represented well. That is why this legislation adding 15 new seats to southern Ontario while also maintaining 11 seats, one more than what’s permissible in the federal system, is a step in the right direction so that we have communities that are represented effectively and well in this chamber.", "Speaker, you know that the province corresponds to or matches the ridings at the federal level. In the case of my riding of Ottawa Centre, which is a downtown community, it is two thirds of the regional city of Ottawa before amalgamation. My community is quite densely populated. In fact, it’s now growing vertically. With all the different condo towers that are starting to go up, those are vertical neighbourhoods.", "I have about 123,000 people who live in my community that I have the pleasure of representing. It’s more, I believe, than Prince Edward county, or Prince Edward Island; sorry—and the county as well. It’s a pleasure to represent them.", "Now, my riding does not get impacted that much through this legislation. There are only two boundaries that get changed, from representing both sides of the road to the middle of the road, so I probably lose, I think, about 30 homes, roughly speaking: one on Baseline Road, where the south side of Baseline will become part of Ottawa West–Nepean and I’ll just maintain the north side, which is the experimental farm. It’s the same thing with Fisher Avenue, where I had both sides of Fisher Avenue and now we will just have the east side of Fisher, and the west side will go as part of Ottawa West–Nepean.", "I support those changes. In fact, when the boundary commission federally was doing their analysis, we presented at that process, asking for that clear delineation to erase some of the confusion that exists between those two ridings, because the boundaries used to get confusing and when you spoke to people, they weren’t sure whether they were part of Ottawa Centre or Ottawa West–Nepean.", "But the way the riding is maintained keeps the nature and the character of the riding, the culture of the riding being the downtown community—as Ottawa Centre. I’m proud of that, that it stays the same way—and so is the name of the riding, which has been around for a long period of time.", "I just wanted to say, in my limited time, that I support the changes. I think this will make our democracy that much more effective. It will allow for better voices and more diverse and representative voices being reflected in this House, when these changes come through and we have 15 more new members talking about the wishes, the desires and the aspirations of those communities, which will only mean that we have an even more inclusive and effective democracy, and a better society as a result, that we all aspire to." ],

The boundaries were set by the electoral boundary commission, which I had the pleasure of presenting to a number of years ago. I made a deputation towards what is now my riding of Ottawa South—I wasn’t the member then. I was pleased to make that deputation. In making that deputation, one of the arguments that I used was that it was a great riding to run an election in. The transportation routes were great, the polling stations were great, the size was good—it’s a little bit big, but you could effectively make sure you did your best to get the people out to vote and it wasn’t difficult or a challenge. When we run in elections and as members, we have to be encouraging people to vote. So I felt very fortunate.", "There’s a very minor change. A number of houses in my riding are no longer there. But after listening to the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane this morning, I’m very fortunate to be in that kind of a riding. There are larger rural ridings that have challenges; he mentioned his two communities of Thorne and Eldee and a community that was just on the side of the lake. That’s a barrier to people participating in democracy as well, because it’s hard to—the larger the area is, the weaker the transportation networks. It’s often harder to get people to participate in democracy, and to service them as well.", "People don’t make distinctions on those boundaries; we have to educate them. But it doesn’t really matter to them whether they live just on the other side of Ottawa South and are in Ottawa Centre. From our office, whoever comes there, we serve. We’ll connect them to another office.", "I do want to make a couple of comments with regard to voter turnout—something that concerns me, and since we’re having this opportunity to talk about democracy, because that’s what these boundaries are all about: making sure people have a voice. I want to say a few things about voter suppression. We saw in the last election a voter suppression effort around robocalls. But that’s not really what I want to talk about. Voter suppression is not something new. We’ve all been there and we know that it is a tactic that’s employed by people to make sure people don’t vote. It’s not in this bill, but I want to mention that right now as it is something that I think we have to take more seriously. I think, no matter what side you’re on, it’s a fundamental interference with people’s democratic right, and I think it should be taken very seriously.", "I also wanted to make one more point with regard to some of the comments from the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane around scandal. There’s an interesting thing. A Ford will never say GM’s cars are going to kill you, because the next thing that you get from that is that cars are going to kill you. But as a group, we attack the category. We attack each other. We impugn motives on each other at times that we know aren’t accurate, and we all do it to each other. I don’t think that does the voter a service. I think we have to hold each other to account on the basis of the things that we’ve done, but not impugn motives on people and become personal. I think the personal part of politics, when we call each other names, that’s the thing that really turns people off.", "We’re here to work together. That’s what people expect from us.

  "text" : [ "It’s an honour to join the debate on this important topic.", "As I have been hearing the debate, I have been thinking a little bit about some of the constituents in my community in Etobicoke Centre. Etobicoke Centre has one of the highest percentages of seniors of any riding in the province and in the country. Some of the seniors who live in my community reflect sometimes about the value of their vote, the value of their franchise, about the right to vote. Once in a while, I hear from seniors, particularly people who have come to Canada from other countries where that right is not enshrined in the way it is here in Canada, about how fortunate we are that we live in this great country and that we have the opportunity to shape the future of our community and of our country.", "Something that has stuck with me in hearing from them is how important it is that we do our best to make sure that everyone has an equal right to vote and as equal an influence as possible over the decisions that are made here and that shape our future.", "With that in mind, I think this bill helps to do that. The first thing it does is, of course, amend the boundaries, and it has been mentioned on a number of occasions here during this debate that the amending of those boundaries will help ensure that the riding boundaries are set in such a way that they are more representative of the population that they encompass, which ensures that the vote and voting influence within each riding is more equitably distributed. I think that’s important.", "The other thing that it does is requires that youth—16- to 17-year-olds—be registered in collaboration with the Chief Electoral Officer. I think that’s a positive thing. Let me talk a little bit about as to why I think that is, the first reason being—and I’ve mentioned this a little bit—this principle of equal representation. Redistributing the boundaries will help ensure that every person’s vote has more equal weight. We heard the story about one of the members on this side who has a riding with about 250,000 people in it. My community has about 115,000. That’s a vast difference. Redistributing the ridings will allow that to be a little bit more equal.", "The second thing I think it does is it allows for better coordination between provincial and federal members. I work closely with my counterpart. He happens to be of a different political persuasion, but we nevertheless work together on a range of issues that touch our community. I think that’s an important aspect of what my role is and what our roles are as representatives. Having multiple boundaries cut across a single riding, or multiple federal ridings that cross a provincial one or vice versa, makes it really challenging to collaborate effectively, especially for those folks who end up in those areas where there are multiple ridings within your riding. This helps to coordinate and collaborate in the interests of constituents much more effectively.", "To the extent that there are ridings that become quite large, like the one that was mentioned earlier with 250,000 or so people, this bill will allow those constituents to get better service from their elected official because that elected official will have a more manageable number of constituents who they serve, allow them to respond and advocate on their behalf effectively, and invest the time with each of them as is required.", "The other piece that I think is really positive about the bill is this idea of engaging young people at an earlier age. One of the favourite parts of this job for me is visiting civics classes in my community of Etobicoke Centre and talking to young people about what we do as politicians, the importance of the vote, the decisions that we make, and why it’s important that they get engaged and stay engaged. My big takeaway from each of the classes that I speak to is whatever you do, when you get to 18 years old, please make sure you vote. I think this is something that will help facilitate that process, that engagement as well.", "When you think about the decisions that we make here, most of the decisions take time to implement and most of the decisions are long-range in their nature. They are going to impact our young people more than anyone else, arguably, in many cases—not in all cases, but in many. Having our young people engaged is critical.", "I think this is a bill that helps strengthen our democracy. It helps strengthen our franchise. It helps ensure that we better coordinate with our federal counterparts. It engages the next generation of voters more effectively. I think that’s all positive. Hopefully, we can get this bill passed and move on to the other matters that are important to the constituents in Ontario and my constituents of Etobicoke Centre." ],

To be honest with you, Mr. Speaker, it’s a very short bill. The lengthy part of the bill is to draw the boundaries in the north, where we have the 11 ridings that are different from the federal boundaries that are established under the federal election boundaries commission.", "I think what we’re doing here is exactly what we did in the middle 1990s. I remember it was done, if I remember correctly, in 2005. I ran in a by-election in 2005, and I had to run within the old boundaries. Two years later, I was running within different boundaries, which caused a lot of grief, if I could put it that way.", "Again, here we are in 2015, and we’re discussing it before the next election, hopefully, in 2018. But it’s a necessary thing to do, because the voting public should know that their vote has an equal and, if I could say, fair representation here in the Legislature, that certain members are not disenfranchised.", "As you heard, my colleague from Oak Ridges–Markham has a population of well over 200,000; she has 177,000 voters. Myself, I have only about 88,000 voters, and I’ve got about 132,000 residents in my area. The reason for doing this boundary change before the next election, and mirroring the image of the boundaries of the federal government, is really to provide the public with fair representation.", "I heard a couple of people across the way speak about certain things, and I want to comment on them. I heard, I believe, two or three members supportive of a permanent electors list. I have to tell you, it may work well in the north, and maybe in southern Ontario, where you don’t have a lot of movement of individuals. I know my colleague from Leeds–Grenville complained that in his area, people who have never moved for 35 years, their name disappeared on the list. We’ve had a permanent list for quite a while, so the list is not the issue. The issue is the administration by Elections Ontario and their team in doing the proper job.", "On the opposite side, in the urban centres, like my own riding, I find that the list is changing so rapidly that they can’t keep up with it because of the movement of people, because we have, if I could say, compact densities, that people have to move. We have a lot of people that live in rental property, and they have to move for whatever reason. Then we have a lot of movement because of the seniors moving from their home that they have lived in for 30, 40 years into something smaller to accommodate them.", "For some reason, Elections Ontario cannot keep up with these list changes. I think that’s what we should focus on: why it is they can’t keep up, and why it is that the list cannot be accurate. I can tell you that in my own list, I know it’s well over 10% inaccurate. I’ve had thousands of voters on my list who have left. I’ve had people vote but I can’t find them. This is not right.", "I think one of the failures we have in the list also is, if your name is not on the list, they’ll allow you to put it on on election day. If you look at the foundation of a democracy, it is set that you have to be a citizen to vote. If you look at the IDs that Elections Ontario accept, very few of them actually prove you’re a citizen. To me, that’s the biggest failure in the system. How can you protect the democratic institution when the one important document, which is to identify that I’m a citizen of Canada, is not there in the act?", "That’s a discussion of another day.

They elect 27 members of the Legislature; 10 of them get in cabinet. They have four senators and four members of Parliament—MPs—to represent 146,000 people.

The federal government of course will only have 10 ridings in the north but we on this side of the House—and I’m glad that the member for Elgin–Middlesex–London agrees with that, that we maintain those ridings, because the situation in the north is special, as some of the speakers have referenced. Just the sheer size, the physical size of the geographical area and the way the population is spread around—it is very, very difficult and challenging to maintain contact with a population spread around such a huge area. So thank you for that support, to the official opposition, on this. I do note that you somewhat apologized for your federal cousins by saying, “I guess my party missed this one,” referencing the federal Progressive Conservatives.", "With respect to Willowdale, Willowdale is being carved up a little bit. Right now there are 140,000 constituents in Willowdale. It’s very dense and although it is relatively easy, in terms of dealing with the geography of Willowdale, it’s a challenge dealing with 140,000 people. I am losing a corner of my riding on the southeast corner of the riding, but I’m gaining another piece on the northwest corner of the riding.

We’ve probably all experienced and we’ve all had people contacting us after elections to tell us how frustrated they are with the state of the voters list. That’s why—I think it came up earlier in debate—the idea of some sort of permanent voter’s card makes sense, whether it be your health card that doubles as a voter’s card, perhaps, and it’s the individual’s responsibility—if you change your address, you have to change your driver’s licence and you have your voter’s card up to date. Perhaps that would be a way of actually having accurate lists. But we can certainly do a better job than we have historically. I think that’s an area that needs improvement.", "In terms of Ontario maintaining 11 northern ridings, as this bill does do, as one of those 11 northern ridings, I completely support that. The fact of the matter is that the geography of northern Ontario is huge. My riding of Parry Sound–Muskoka is one of the smaller ones, and I believe it stays more or less the same with these proposed changes. But for me to go from my home to Dokis First Nation, it’s a three-and-a-half-hour drive one way to get there, so obviously that makes it challenging. It’s just big. I have 26 municipalities, seven First Nations that have unorganized territories, and there’s only so much you can do to try to get around to provide proper representation.", "As was pointed out, when you compare it to Prince Edward Island in particular, that would be one riding and one MPP in Ontario at the current state.

I look at the bill itself, “to enact the Representation Act, 2015, repeal the Representation Act, 2005 and amend the Election Act, the Election Finances Act and the Legislative Assembly Act,” and as we know, much of this legislation is certainly the southern riding boundaries as derived from federal legislation, the Canada Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.", "A lot of it is about redistribution for the purpose of representation. Ontario—bear with me—is divided into the following electoral districts: the 11 northern electoral districts whose names and boundaries are set out in this legislation itself; and, almost by default, the remaining 111 southern electoral districts, whose names and boundaries are set out in the federal legislation. So this legislation really doesn’t have to go into detail about rivers and roads, and changes and subtractions and additions with respect to much of the new system.", "The federal electoral districts come into effect on the first dissolution of Parliament after May 1, 2014—as we know, that has already happened—and the present redistribution provincially takes effect immediately after dissolution after November 30, 2016. So we have a deadline of November 2016, and until that happens, we remain with 107 seats, or electoral districts.", "The system remains—and I am personally thankful for this—one member for each district. I find that’s fairly simple for the people that I represent, in contrast to an idea that was floated several elections ago, the proportional representation system. In fact, after that election—and many of us spent a fair number of all-candidates’ nights discussing proportional representation. I know down my way all the parties supported that except mine, and I really was in the minority. I think we did something like 10 all-candidates’ nights, 10 evenings of debating proportional representation. I was obviously in the minority and got beat up a bit on my position of first-past-the-post, one member, one vote, and one representative for each riding.", "As it turns out, election day came and left and the decision was made to have the referendum, and the people rejected proportional representation. I consider that a dead issue; some may not. I see in the media talk again of bringing back that debate.", "The legislation before us comes from recommendations from the Chief Electoral Officer, and this government has indicated that they are committed to addressing these recommendations and a few other things: “Moving the fixed election date from fall to spring,” as described, “to help avoid overlap with federal and municipal elections”; “Engaging more young people with the voting process”—not giving them the vote, but engaging them with the process—“through provisional registration” for those who are 16 or 17, but the voting age still remains 18; “Strengthening rules on ... third-party advertising.”", "Just going back to having the spring election and some of the reasons given—and this is a news release from the Ontario government, I notice—to “make it easier for people to vote because the weather is usually better.” I don’t know about that, how we can predict the weather, spring and fall. So far we’ve had a pretty nice fall. Albeit much of it is in the summertime, there are great days in September, October—not November. We get a lot of rain in April, May.", "Ideally, and I say this as a farmer, you get those hot, dry winds, certainly in southern Ontario—I can’t speak to the north—that dry up our land so we can get corn and beans in at that time of year.", "They talk about how the days are longer and, again, reducing the overlap with other elections at the provincial and at the federal level.", "I will mention that I represent presently a riding that is named Haldimand–Norfolk. I was first elected in 1995, and at that time the riding was just called Norfolk, as it had been called for many, many years. I notice the photographs in the halls of this precinct of some of my predecessors who represented the riding of Norfolk, gosh, going back to the 1850s. Looking at those photographs, by and large, in many of the ridings, if you will, in many cases you did ride the riding by horseback or horse and carriage, perhaps horse and sleigh. Many of the ridings seemed to mimic or follow the county boundaries, and that really would have been a boon for people to figure out—there wasn’t the access to communication we have now as far as where they live and who they vote for, municipally, provincially and federally.", "My grandfather was a federal MP and he represented the riding of Norfolk back in the day, just after the Second World War.

I’m sure that some people, if they were serious, maybe felt it was a bit of a challenge because nobody knew me in Tillsonburg. I had worked in the Norfolk, Haldimand and Brant area for many, many years. Part of my job—I actually did more speaking engagements in the community than I seem to do now, in a sense, as a consultant. Because of the jurisdiction and the industries that I was consulting with, Tillsonburg wasn’t in my area. I think I maybe knew a few people in Tillsonburg. By the same token, they would not have known who I was. That was a challenge.", "Many of us like a challenge; we seek a challenge. Most of my focus was on the town of Tillsonburg at the time. The Norfolk-Tillsonburg riding boundaries had been that way for many, many years. I know that my predecessor, NDP Norm Jamison, represented that area, and the chap before him, MPP Gord Miller, a Liberal, represented Norfolk-Tillsonburg. It made sense because Tillsonburg is a unique town. It sits right on the intersection of three different counties. So, again, following county lines didn’t necessarily make that much sense. How do you decide in which county Tillsonburg would land? Much of the riding distribution does seem to be out of the hands of our area. The massive ebb and flow of population across the province of Ontario over the last 200 years has had an effect on the boundaries down my way.", "A number of years later, as with many MPPs, the boundaries changed again, and I ran in a riding that represented all of Norfolk county but subtracted Tillsonburg. I was able to win in a riding that encompassed a major part of Haldimand county but not Dunnville; Tim Hudak remained in the Dunnville riding even though it was part of Haldimand county. I had the good fortune to represent, as I recall, three townships in Brant county. Burford township, the town of Burford, like Tillsonburg, always seemed to be bounced from pillar to post, depending on these decisions made by the commission as far as population movements. I represented Burford township, Oakland township and Onondaga township, and many of these areas were far to the north of where I lived. Interestingly enough, the further north I went and the farther away I got from home, the more votes I got. I kind of asked myself: “What does that mean?”", "The boundaries changed again in my particular area. I lost Brant county—a bit of a blessing personally because I was trying to cover three different agricultural counties. It was an awful lot of travel. You attend three different counties in one day. Much of my focus is on farm organizations. So rather than, for example, attending one meeting of, say, the Norfolk Federation of Agriculture, I would also have to attend the Haldimand Federation of Agriculture and the Brant federation, or the cattlemen’s association or the dairy organizations. Rather than attending one county meeting or one annual meeting, you attend three annual meetings.", "Brant county was lost, as far as the area I represented, and I gained, to my good fortune, the town of Dunnville, which seemed to be, fortunately for me, about as Conservative as the town of Tillsonburg, which I’d lost a few years earlier.", "I think my point is that changes in boundaries do have an influence, obviously, on representation, on the kind of elected representative you end up with. I suppose. looking through the lens. of those of us elected here, it has a big influence on the work we do, depending on the mix of the people who have found themselves in your particular riding.", "Presently, there are no changes, certainly during this round, in Haldimand–Norfolk. Neighbouring areas have seen some change.", "The riding redistribution review in Ontario, conducted by the electoral boundaries commission for Ontario, took a look at Niagara region—there are almost half a million people there; it’s short of half a million—and made a decision that it would warrant four ridings. If you look at Niagara-Hamilton, the area I represent, and Brant-Brantford, there are about a million, all told. They created a new riding, known as Hamilton West–Ancaster–Dundas. People are fighting that one out, as we speak, at the federal level. It essentially encompasses north and south and the west side of Hamilton region.", "In Niagara, the commission has decided that Niagara West–Glanbrook was due for a change, so during this federal election, it’s now known as Niagara West. If you’ll bear with me—these are the kinds of things that we read in these documents—there was an addition to this new riding of Niagara West, something we will see at the provincial level, of part of the city of St. Catharines—lying west of Louth Street, Highway 406, Third Street and Courtleigh Road—and the township of Wainfleet. That makes an awful lot of sense to me; I border Wainfleet on the east side of my riding.", "There was the subtraction of Binbrook, Glanbrook, Hannon—quite honestly, this is up near my riding, but I have to admit I don’t know where Hannon is, unless there’s a spelling mistake here—and Mount Hope; they were all lost. This is the Tim Hudak riding. They join the new riding of Flamborough–Glanbrook.", "Just to clarify that part of it—and I use this just to indicate the machinations that go on in a process like this, with well over 100 ridings in the province of Ontario—Niagara West now is still Grimsby, Lincoln, Pelham, West Lincoln and Wainfleet, as I mentioned, and part of the city of St. Catharines. We read a very detailed description of where the roads are and how that follows. It makes it very clear to me why, many years ago, we developed the concept of a map. A map describes it much better. I’m sure I would not be allowed to hold up a map; it might be considered a prop.", "It’s interesting: The redistribution leaves this new riding of Niagara West as smaller than the average—the population is 86,533—as part of the four ridings in Niagara, deleting, essentially, that Hamilton side of the riding. Much of this, I feel, makes sense.", "Kitchener South–Hespeler: That’s a new riding that has been created to form parts of the former Kitchener–Conestoga—the member for Kitchener–Conestoga had a few things to say about that this afternoon—and the Cambridge ridings. He made mention of those old historical towns that many of us in the area are so familiar with—Galt, Preston and Hespeler—that, with the advent of regional government and regionalization, are now known as Cambridge.", "It’s clearly necessary every 10 years or so to revisit and revise riding boundaries. It can be confusing for the people who do the voting, those of us who have been involved for many, many years, and we can find it confusing.", "In this sense, it’s perhaps a good thing that we have a longer period for the federal election. A lot of people wouldn’t agree with that; people are finding that annoying. But if it does one thing, it gives people more time to sort out which riding they live in and who they vote for. There are an awful lot of changes right across Canada.", "They’ve got a bit more time, obviously, to get to know a bit about the issues but also to find out who their candidates are. A lot of those candidates are brand new, and a lot of the seasoned politicians have retired, certainly in Ontario. So you have voters who are finding themselves in a different riding altogether, or they’re in the same old riding but it has a new name. These folks are going to show up at the polls—hopefully only once—to vote once on election day, on the 19th. Some people may be a little baffled that the guy or the gal that they normally vote for isn’t on the ballot this time—this person might be running somewhere else, or maybe they have retired.", "Very simply—and it seems simple—we mirror the federal electoral boundaries, and we add 15 new ridings to increase the size of the Legislature to 122, with that one difference. Northern Ontario will continue to follow the boundaries set out in 2004, and I think we all agree to that. At some point, there may be a case where part of rural Ontario may need some similar consideration.", "Mirroring the federal boundaries: Certainly, with my history in this place, that was the idea put forward and accomplished by a former Premier, Mike Harris. Part of his goal—and that’s the reason I got involved in this business back in 1994. He made a commitment to reduce the number of MPPs to 103 from 130. He did that in 1999, and he did that by electoral redistribution, a promise that was made. I remember that day very well. I know that people down in my neck of the woods—we literally cheered that night, that he was going to cut the number of politicians by 20%." ],

But the problem with some of these changes is the fact that traditional areas in certain municipalities get split up. In other words, if you had, let’s say, Winona-Stoney Creek, and they have always voted together and they have similar issues and similar wishes—these sometimes get broken up, and they have to end up voting with another group that may have a different interest and a different agenda, and they don’t really feel part of the process. That’s one of the disadvantages of redistribution.", "When they do these realignments, a lot of the time, it’s politically motivated. Whoever is doing it and decides to bring this forward—whether it be the ruling government, or whoever decides to bring the bill forward—has obviously gone over the maps and had, obviously, an advantage of where they would like to see things go, so they can win the next election and win more seats. Trust me: Those things happen, and it’s unfortunate that people don’t admit that that’s the reason they do the boundary changes.", "Certainly population distribution is important too. Some people have more people to represent than others. In the North they have a lot less to represent. In the south it varies, because with all the building going on in southern Ontario, different populations change and vary. That could have a different negative or positive impact on the boundary change. I have concerns when they change the boundaries, because when I look at the maps, I see that it might favour the blue guys or it might favour the red guys, but very seldom does it favour the orange guys." ],

My riding is one of the larger ridings. It’s not as large as those up north, but it takes me an hour and a half from one end to the other. I have lost portions in the west and in the east. Such a little town that I have developed a great relationship with is Uxbridge, which is to the west; to the east, I’ve lost Newcastle and Orono. These are areas that I’ve come to know very well, having grown up in that neighbourhood.", "Again, I do see the need for changes. For example, 10 years ago, Bowmanville’s population was roughly 45,000; now it’s 95,000. Uxbridge has around 30,000. Scugog, on the other hand, has around 25,000. So you’re looking at representing 150,000 people in this area, which is manageable, but it’s a bit much.", "Also, another fact that I take into consideration: After this federal election, I would have had the MPs, which would be rather difficult to work with. It would make life a lot more difficult.", "So although I do have apprehensions about the changes because of my relationships that I’ve developed within the various communities, I can see the rationale for it.

Electoral reform is part of that discussion, that conversation and that debate.", "What is missing in this piece of legislation, though, is current relevant issues that we are facing even in the Legislature this morning—an updated piece of legislation as it relates to the bribery sections of the Election Act, for instance. If you’re going to review a piece of legislation around electoral reform, why not capture the places that are being missed right now, like the bribery sections of the Election Act or the advertising component that happened in Simcoe North most recently, where an ad was placed in contravention of the Election Act.

I don’t know if he’s still running that bar and restaurant. Again, to gerrymander: to manipulate the boundaries. It works well in a first-past-the-post system; not so much in a proportional representation system. It always seems to work well for the incumbent, the party in power, the people who do draw the maps, the state or political groups who have the opportunity to draw the maps. It is really quite interesting. Sometimes it is done for good reasons, to avoid any kind of racial discrimination, for example, by drawing a boundary map to encompass a certain racial group within one boundary so they have a much higher chance of winning the election. This is done in many of the states in the United States." ],

We should be talking about democracy and increasing voter turnout. When we discuss electoral boundaries, it’s important to ensure that not only the electorate is onside, but that local city councils and regional councils and county councils, and community groups as well, are involved and have the opportunity to actually speak to those changes.", "During the federal boundary changes back in 2012, the federal boundary commission had hearings in Niagara because it was proposing changes in Niagara, as well as changes in the Hamilton area. The federal Conservatives at the time were proposing to actually change my riding by taking out the city of Thorold and adding the city of Fort Erie, without any regard to anything else other than that they wanted Thorold, because Thorold, of course, is a stronghold for the NDP. Even when we had a Liberal government federally for 33 years, we won every poll in the town of Thorold. They proposed to take this community of about 18,000 people, a small manufacturing town—paper mills, factories—and attach this town in the east to the big rural riding of Niagara West–Glanbrook, with a little wee strip of the bottom of the minister without portfolio’s riding, St. Catharines; to cut Thorold right out of our riding and then to give us Fort Erie down the road, which we’d be happy to have.", "However, we didn’t have similarities with the town of Fort Erie. We have many similarities with the town of Thorold. They didn’t look at the fact that Fort Erie, Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake are all border communities. They all border the United States. They all have very similar issues. But the Conservatives federally just wanted to knock Thorold out because they thought that they might have a chance to take over the riding of Welland, which has been held by the New Democrats for 40 years this year.", "There was no thought even given to the fact that we are a two-tiered government, that we have north-south or east-west bus routes. They didn’t look at our regional busing system. They didn’t look at any of the planning processes or reports at the Niagara region to see what kinds of plans there were for economic growth and between which municipalities in the Niagara region. None of that was taken into account. It was just clearly, “Well, we’re going to try and level these numbers out and we’re going to do this by attaching this little strip of a town to a completely rural riding.”", "It made no sense whatsoever, and so of course I went out and made presentations, as did our federal member, as did probably every mayor across the Niagara region—and some of the city councillors—to the federal boundary commission. They bought our arguments, at the end of the day. We even went into as much detail as what is long distance—because, across Niagara, the whole Niagara region cannot call each other without incurring long-distance charges. So to actually make that move and add Fort Erie to Welland would have been long distance for the constituents, where Thorold to Welland is actually not long distance. I can tell you, we’ve been after Bell Canada for a hundred years to actually make the whole Niagara region with no long-distance charges and they’ve refused to do it to date. They didn’t look at the transportation corridors. They didn’t do any of those things.", "It was interesting, because after the boundaries commission actually made their recommendation, then the member from St. Catharines, Rick Dykstra, the MP, came back to committee and tried to get it changed again even though he had not shown up or made any presentation. So when we talk about gerrymandering or manipulating, clearly it happens. It happened in my riding.", "But there’s other stuff that Elections Ontario needs to look at as well. I know I’ve met with the elections commissioner after both of the last two elections. We talked about some of the things that certainly happened during the provincial elections in my riding—I’m sure that they happened in some of yours as well—where full streets or areas in a community didn’t get voter registration cards. You know how ticked off people get when they don’t get a voter registration card? They don’t want to go out to vote, because that registration card tells them where they’re voting, what time they’re voting, when the polls are open and where the returning offices are. You know, we have a low enough voter turnout that, in fact, those small things need to be fixed.", "We also need to make sure of, and this legislation could address that, the locations of where the returning offices are. I can tell you, in 2011 and in 2014 in my riding, the returning office was on the site of an old, closed factory, not on a bus route, kind of at the edge of the city, with no access for anybody to get there without a vehicle. You probably have to walk three quarters of a kilometre from the bus stop to actually get there to vote if you don’t have a car. So I talked to the elections commissioner about that issue as well. I would think that the Liberal government would be interested in getting as many voters to the polls as possible. But, in fact, we’re not addressing any of that language in this particular bill.", "This is the kind of work that can be done by Elections Ontario, but we need to ensure, as MPPs, that in fact we’re sharing that information with the commissioner. Each and every one of us should be meeting with him after each election.", "The issue of not having access to go into apartment buildings and senior centres—you don’t know how many times in the last two provincial elections that I was denied access; even in the Sudbury by-election, we were denied access into an apartment building. Elections Ontario doesn’t have any staff around to actually deal with those issues. When you call in to complain, they say, “Sorry, put it in your report. We don’t have anybody to deal with it,” so we can’t get our information and you can’t get your information to the voters. Then, you can’t encourage people to actually go out and vote.", "Then there is the issue of the photo ID piece that I think a few people actually talked about today. Certainly I come from a riding where there are many, many seniors—one of the highest senior populations, actually, in the province. Many seniors don’t have any photo ID. If they don’t have a driver’s licence and they don’t have a new health card—there are still millions of people without the new health card—then when they actually get to a voting station, they have problems actually trying to get to vote, particularly if they were one of those people who didn’t get a voter registration card. Then they’re being harassed by poll clerks and by DROs, these 80- and 90-year-old people who are trying to go out and actually be democratic and exercise their vote. These are the kinds of things that this bill should actually be dealing with.", "Now, the federal government also ended the door-to-door census. I can tell you that I did those door-to-door censuses a few times in my lifetime when I was actually working in another career. We had to go back four and five times to make sure that we got each and every person that we thought lived in those houses and get correct information. Now, today, we get these short forms; some people fill them out and some people don’t. I heard somebody say today, I think it was the member from Scarborough–Rouge River, his lists were 10% incorrect. I can tell you that in the elections I’ve been involved in, there have been probably 40% to 50% of the voters on the lists whose information is incorrect. They either don’t live there anymore—especially if you have a lot of apartment buildings in your particular riding, because the turnover in apartment buildings is so high.", "I think those are some of the things that we should actually be dealing with in this bill, and I would think that the Liberals would actually want to do that. I would hope that Elections Canada and Elections Ontario would want to be promoting and encouraging voting, especially for young people.", "I live in a riding where we have a very high volume of students, as well. Niagara College is in my riding, in Welland; we have a campus in Welland. Brock University also borders on my riding. Between those two institutions, there are probably 30,000 students. But I can tell you that when we actually go out and canvass—I’ve experienced this in my own elections, and I’ve certainly experienced it in federal elections as well—these students don’t get any information. They’re living in student housing. They’re living in rental units. They’re not told that they can, in fact, vote where they’re going to school or they can vote at home.", "It’s very difficult for them, because they need to have something, some piece of ID that actually says, “I’m residing at 40 Smith Street in Thorold.” Many of them don’t, because their parents signed a lease for them on their rental unit, so then when it comes time to vote, they don’t have the appropriate information, the appropriate identification to go out and exercise their vote—although they want to, right? But it becomes so troublesome for them that they then decide just not to do it, unless they happen to be going home.", "Now, this time around, I think that in this federal election the advance polls are happening over Thanksgiving weekend, so hopefully many of these students will be going home to their own communities and they’ll have an opportunity to vote over that Thanksgiving long weekend.", "It’s kind of disturbing that the federal government has in place put such harsh restrictions which really prohibit and make people refrain from going out to vote. Essentially, Speaker, the “unfair elections act” that was proposed by the federal government—they call it the Fair Elections Act, but it’s the “unfair elections act.” I used some of my time to highlight what some of those issues are, but it’s not the only piece of legislation that hurts Canadian democracy.", "A bill was passed that actually prohibits people who live abroad from voting.

Clearly their message to me yesterday was that they’re certainly feeling undervalued in their golden years. I think we should be dealing with some of these issues, certainly as a federal issue. I actually have a bill in to deal with veterans and long-term care that is sitting at a committee, that hasn’t been dealt with. I’m hoping that someone who sits in the majority on one of these committees actually brings that bill up to the top so that here at a provincial level we can let our veterans know how much we value them and respect them.", "I think that with changing the electoral boundaries, many ridings will be changing. Mine won’t very much, as I let you know. But it does cause confusion to the electorate. It also causes confusion to local representatives. And I can tell you, even with the St. Catharines riding—for example, I have a small strip of the south end of St. Catharines and I have people all the time say to me, “Oh, you’re my MPP? I thought it was Mr. Bradley.” Even though that boundary has been there for many, many years, the electorate still doesn’t readily have that information available to them. I’m sure that the member from Kitchener–Waterloo—I was going to speak about the split in her riding, but I’ll let her do that when she actually gets up to speak.", "I think I’ve raised a lot of issues for people to contemplate over my 20 minutes and I hope that now that the act is open the government will be interested in looking at some amendments to make sure that we have the best possible voter turnout and the best accessibility for voters in the province of Ontario." ],

Of course, what has happened is that each time the federal government changes their boundaries, we once again then need to make the decision whether we should have our own provincial distribution, or whether we should simply follow the federal boundaries. What this bill represents is the very simple decision that we will, indeed, as a province, follow the federal boundaries. I would suggest that that actually, in some ways, addresses some of the concerns that the members have been raising.", "It is no doubt confusing to constituents when the boundaries change. It’s doubly confusing to constituents if the boundaries change, and they change differently federally and provincially. So while the inevitability is that populations move and some places get bigger and some places get smaller, and therefore redistribution must occur so that we can respect the principle of representation by population, this is actually the simplest way for the public to deal with that change. The exception is the northern ridings where all three parties, I think, agree that we will not redistribute them because they would just become impossibly huge for the members who represent them." ],

People would come in to vote, people who I knew lived in the riding all their lives. In fact, one year we had half of them, their addresses were in the Yukon, so we had to change them all. It was incredible. Of course, we have a little town called Alma in our riding. In the riding, we also have a township called Alma. I mean, these things can be confusing.

On the back of the card we had a certification—“I solemnly swear”—where every resident had their picture, their permanent address; and as the owner of this property, I was able to sign. We laminated them. Every single senior was able to come and vote on the day. I wanted to share the importance of seniors and also our youth voting, but there are ways that we can help create—that is one thing that I was most proud to do when I was the general manager of the retirement residence in Orléans, Portobello Manor.", "Having said that, I also know that it’s growth: This bill is about the fact that we need representation from people of our community to ensure that we can best represent them here. Certainly, for me, living in Orléans, every day I turn around there is a new development.

So there are severe constraints on my ability to truly represent all the residents of my riding.", "This is very true for many of us in York region. We will be moving, in York region, from essentially six and a half ridings to eight and a half—we share one with Simcoe county—so we’re gaining two ridings. When October 20 comes around, after the federal election a month or so from now, I will have four MPs who will be representing my constituents. I anticipate that, no doubt, we will all do a great job representing our constituents.

I found it a very fair process.", "I was able to argue for the maintenance of the old core of the original town of Markham, established in 1825, that that historical centre be kept together. Another issue is that many people didn’t want to see the name of the new riding of Aurora–Richmond Hill that was proposed, that there be the maintenance of the term “Oak Ridges,” so that the new riding is Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, because we would not want to lose that important reference to the moraine.", "The process, I think, was a very good one.

That’s fascinating to see, and very encouraging as well", "But I wanted to actually pick up on a point that the previous member, the Minister of Community and Social Services, spoke to. She talked about the size, scope and breadth of her own electoral district of Oak Ridges–Markham, a wonderful community that literally abuts my riding of Vaughan.

But in many respects it also speaks to the fact that this is a very necessary move on the part of this government, and on the part of this Legislature, to reconsider exactly how we draw these boundaries, to make sure that people living right across the province, but I would say particularly in fast-growing regions and communities like those that exist in York region, Peel, Durham and elsewhere—that those individuals, those families, those businesses have an equitable approach to the representation they have.", "There are many, many challenges that individuals face in the communities we all represent. To make sure that we have numbers of representatives that are not only equitable but also fair, in terms of giving those individuals a voice here in this chamber as we debate, discuss, pass legislation and govern, is extremely important. So I’m very happy, Speaker, to lend my voice to this.", "I had the chance, going back a number of years before I was elected to serve in this Legislature, to witness some of the other redistribution efforts that occurred. Of course, I know there has been some discussion here this afternoon about the big move that took place a number of years ago, when this Legislature went from, I believe, 130 seats down to 99 seats. That was a very large transformational move. There have been other adjustments that have occurred since that time.", "But I think it is important to note, and I said it at the outset of my comments this afternoon, when you hear discussions on all sides of the House, from all three parties, all three caucuses, that even though there are, at least from what I have heard so far on this bill, some suggestions around things that should perhaps be tweaked or reconsidered—not in a fundamental way, of course, but around the margins with respect to this legislation—I think it is very clear that there is broad support for moving forward with this particular bill.", "There will, of course, be additional adjustments that are brought to bear throughout the rest of the legislative process, and that is perfectly reasonable, as happens with much, if not all, the legislation that comes through this place. But it is fundamental for those we represent, whether it’s in York region or in other parts of the province—the notion that we would retain what I’ll call that extra seat, that 11th seat in northern Ontario, is obviously something very, very important to those individuals who live in the north.", "We’ve heard a lot of arguments here this afternoon in terms of the ability for all of us to interact with our federal counterparts for what I’ll call clarity of understanding for those we represent, so that they know they are represented by the same individuals with the same boundaries, so there’s a great deal less confusion around matters like that. When you look at the totality of this bill and this legislation, and what we are undertaking with respect to making sure we get it right and move our provincial democracy forward in the most effective way possible, I believe that all members will join with us, certainly in the discussion we’ve seen so far here today, again understanding that there are some fairly nuanced differences of opinion around some of the specific matters. But broadly speaking, we all want to get on with the task at hand, which is to make sure that we have the most effective, most representative government serving, here in this chamber, all of the electoral districts across the province of Ontario.", "Speaking as the MPP for Vaughan, representing a fast-growing community, as much as I love serving all of Vaughan, Woodbridge, Kleinburg and Maple—and I know that may change over time if we pass this legislation—it is the right thing to do.

At that time, I did present a deputation. My riding’s boundaries are staying the same, although we do have a growing number of residents. I advocated to maintain the existing boundaries, because one part was to be sectioned off. My riding, as are many other ridings, is defined by what are called natural boundaries: rivers, highways, railways. The part that was to be added to another riding really wouldn’t have any access to that other riding. In other words, the residents go to school, they shop, they have their places of worship and all their transportation connections all on the side of the riding that they are next to right now. It wouldn’t have any of those connections with the new boundary, so I, together with other local elected officials, advocated to maintain these existing boundaries.", "So, yes, it will be a challenge to continue to represent the residents in an effective manner, because we do have a growing population, thanks mainly to the infrastructure projects that are being built by our provincial government in my riding: projects such as the expansion of the Georgetown South line, the UP Express, the Eglinton Crosstown and the new Humber River Hospital that is being built just north of the riding. This is bringing new development to the area and, therefore, we will need to be very vigilant in order to service our constituents well.", "My riding has many needs. I remember when I was first elected many years ago, speaking to one of my colleagues, I asked, “How many ODSP cases do you deal with in a week?” The other member answered, “In a week? Well, probably one or two a year.” We have at least a dozen a week that we’re dealing with. Our ridings are very different. This is what is great about Ontario, that our constituencies are so vast and so different. But they need to be attended to each one in its own way.", "I also wanted to add two comments to what the member for Scarborough–Rouge River brought up and that is the electoral list. In my riding we have many residents who move; the turnaround is quite extensive from election to election and Elections Ontario will need to keep up with that. We need verification. We need quality checks in this regard. It is beneficial overall, I think, to keep the same boundaries as the federal government except for the North, which needs different attention, but at the same time, the lists would be very beneficial to try to keep track of that. That’s why I also support the provision in this bill to allow provisional registration of 16- and 17-year-olds, as recommended by the Chief Electoral Officer, because it will encourage more people to vote and also it would be easier for us to keep track of them.", "These are some of the reasons that I will be wholeheartedly supporting Bill 115." ],

This is basically a redistribution that comes immediately into effect following the first dissolution of the Legislature after November 30, 2016. With it, this legislation is going to create 15 new ridings which will match the federal ridings.", "I do have to point out, though, that I’m glad to support that they did fix this to the northern ridings in order to ensure that they’re properly represented, and not under-represented with the changes that may have occurred if they had totally copied the federal way. In saying that, the 11 ridings in the North will stay untouched: that’s Algoma–Manitoulin, Kenora–Rainy River, Nickel Belt, Nipissing, Parry Sound–Muskoka, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, Thunder Bay–Atikokan, Thunder Bay–Superior North, Timiskaming–Cochrane, and Timmins–James Bay.", "In fact, it spells it out for each area in this legislation, detailing the northern areas and how they’re the same. So Sudbury, for instance, is consisting of “that part of the former city of Sudbury (as existed on December 31, 1996), lying north of a line described as follows: commencing at the intersection of the east limit of said former city and Highway No. 69; thence westerly along said highway to Long Lake Road; thence southerly along said road to the north limit of the geographic township of Broder; thence westerly along the north limit of said geographic township to the west limit of said former city.”", "I think how they laid out Sudbury deals with the redistribution; however, they had the opportunity to actually take a look at Sudbury closer and ensure that at the next election in the Sudbury region there is nobody from the Premier’s office, allegedly under her ideas, bribing the candidates so they do not run. It’s unfortunate that we have to go through this in this Legislature, when in fact we are dealing with electoral reform, which is basically copying what the federal government has done—minus the northern part—but everything else is not being dealt with. It’s unfortunate, and it’s a sad day in democracy when we have to have an OPP charge on top of this government to deal with election fraud.", "These newly created ridings in Ontario reflect the growth in population that we have seen in many communities over the years. It’s essential that all Ontarians are democratically represented.", "I’m happy that this bill is going forward. After the hard work the federal government has done, this Liberal government was able to copy and paste what the federal government had done over two years of work. I do have to say, my MP, Joe Preston, was chair of the procedure committee in Ottawa, and Joe did a wonderful job guiding this bill through the Legislature. Joe is retiring after 11 years of hard work representing the people of Elgin-Middlesex-London. We wish him well as he heads off to retirement.", "In my riding of Elgin–Middlesex–London, my boundaries change a little. I will be losing a little bit of south London near the White Oaks area. That part of the riding will be going over to London–Fanshawe, which is represented right now by Teresa Armstrong. I have really enjoyed dealing with the White Oaks area during my time, and it’s unfortunate that I will be losing them. However, I will continue to represent the people of my riding to the best of my abilities.", "My change is pretty minute compared to some of the ridings that are undergoing massive change: As the member from Nepean–Carleton has said, it’s basically being split into Nepean and Carleton—and a member on the government side representing 250,000 people, which is quite a large task to do, and they will be better represented.", "However, the other point that I have to make is that it’s not just dealing with the people you represent; it’s also dealing with the municipalities. Some ridings deal with one municipality and are able to work well with them. In my riding, I deal with 10 municipalities, and after the redistribution, I’ll continue to work with 10 municipalities. I have the city of London, the city of St. Thomas, the municipality of West Elgin, the municipality of Dutton Dunwich, Central Elgin, Aylmer, Malahide, Bayham, Southwold and, of course, Thames Centre. I will continue to work with those municipalities to the fullest of my abilities. So it’s not always based on the fact of the people you serve; it’s also the lower level of government that you also are serving. It would be interesting to find out how that is changing in the redistribution of the ridings and if there’s an increase in the amount of municipalities that members have to work with.", "I enjoy very much representing my riding of Elgin–Middlesex–London; I’ve lived there my entire life. Back in 1999, before the first of many changes occurred, it was basically the riding of Elgin. I can just imagine the conversations they had when they discussed expanding it to Elgin–Middlesex–London for the first time. You’re moving outside of Elgin county into Middlesex county and south of London. The task, they must have thought, of having to cover those areas—but I tell you, I’ve enjoyed every moment of getting across the three different parts of my riding and getting to know the people that live there and working to the betterment of Ontario together.", "Constituency problems are different but the same throughout our communities. As I’ve mentioned before, the 10 different municipalities that I deal with, although we do have some common goals—like the majority of my municipalities are against the Green Energy Act crusade because they have lost the ability to make decisions as to whether or not they get windmills or solar panels—there are other discrepancies in my municipalities. For instance, the majority of my municipalities, outside of London, have been cut from OMPF funding for the last few years, which was pretty drastic to their ability to budget accordingly for the next year. However, I do have a municipality that has benefited and grown under the OMPF. So representing here at the Legislature, where the majority of my members have been hurt by the cuts to the OMPF, I have one that benefited. I do take the task very seriously in balancing how I represent all municipalities and all people in my riding. I find it quite interesting the differences in the way we are able to do so.", "What was also brought up today, and I found quite interesting, is that the government talked about in their one-hour address earlier, which lasted 15 minutes, the fact that they’re looking to start to collect information on 16- and 17-year-olds, pre-register them so that they’re getting information to be interested in voting, so that when they do turn 18, they’re more apt to vote. I applaud anything that would help our youth to vote.", "I think another solution that the Minister of Education has is taking a look at our curriculum and seeing how we can change the civics classes in grades 5 and 10, or maybe even expanding more so and somehow forming an all-party committee in our areas that we represent and perhaps engaging in the schools—not just in those two grade levels but across the spectrum so they get used to understanding how the electoral system works in Ontario, and so they understand what a member of provincial Parliament does, they understand what the Speaker of the House does, and they understand the importance of government opposition and why it’s important that they’re not always on the same page, so that they’re challenging one another continually for the betterment of Ontario.", "I think maybe, in addition to sending them mail—are they all going to read that, or is it going straight to the blue box?—engaging them at the school so that they encourage themselves to grow with the electoral system so that at the end of the day, when they turn 18, they are ready to vote for them, they want to vote for them—I’m hoping perhaps we can work towards improving our curriculum in that sense.", "I know that, Probably like everyone else in the Legislature, I visit grade 5 classes and high school classes that talk about civics. It opens up a great discussion. There are those students in there that are very keen on knowing more about the system. There are others that haven’t really thought about it, but when you leave the classroom they have a good idea about how the system works.", "It’s very interesting that they talk about creating and collecting the data. I hope the data that they do collect is used appropriately and not used to send out government propaganda in the short term. I hope non-partisan information is sent out so that they learn about the system. That’s waiting to be seen, going forward.", "What’s also interesting about this legislation—I mentioned it earlier. It’s getting a lot of debate, and it’s fine to have a lot of debate. Hopefully, in committee, it tours around the province so that they can hear the considerations that the member from Nepean–Carleton has brought up numerous times. But it’s missing some items and maybe it could have been a better bill if we had added more into the discussion. It’s not unheard of: this government adding more to a simple bill to make a better piece of legislation.", "A few weeks ago, our member from Lanark–Frontenac—did I get it right?—Randy Hillier, came out with his recall legislation bill. Now, we don’t all have to agree on recall legislation. I think there are some very good points that Randy brought forward. Perhaps the numbers were the deciding factor as to why the bill was defeated here in the Legislature, but the recall legislation would allow for constituents to recall their MPP if they are not doing their job. They are protected for the first year after an election and the year before an election. Maybe it’s the percentage of signatures that they do have to collect in order to enact the recall legislation. I mean, the province of BC has this legislation intact, and it seems to be going well. We have seen in the United States where it worked before. It got rid of California Governor Jerry Brown, which brought in Arnold Schwarzenegger, but also in Wisconsin when they tried to pull out Governor Scott Walker; however, he was re-elected again. So we’ve seen both utilizations of this recall legislation used. Maybe it was something that could have been added in here; maybe we could have had more discussion about it, to strengthen up the bill and deal with electoral reform much better than we’ve done before.", "However, the other thing I’ve also discussed earlier was third-party advertising. This was a great opportunity. The government talked about it in their budget, that they would consider changes to third-party advertising, but this was the opportunity. Six months after the budget passed, they have a piece of electoral reform to actually do more than what they’re doing, to not prevaricate around the issue, to go forward and actually put it into legislation. In 2007, third-party advertising was $2.3 million; in 2011, third-party advertising was $6.7 million; in 2014, it hit almost $9 million. You see the upward climb. You see where it’s going. Not that third-party advertising is being non-partisan in any way; it’s turning into personal destruction of people who have put their careers, their lives, into doing their job. To think that we are allowing almost $10 million to be spent to destroy people I think is sick. I think it’s disgusting, and I think this government had an opportunity to fix electoral reform.", "Look at the federal government. The federal government has capped spending at $188,000. They’ve also prevented donations from corporations and unions; they let the people donate. I don’t see why we couldn’t look at changing the system so that the $9 million that is spent, mostly without the choice of many of the members who donate the money, or who have the money taken from them—instead, maybe that money can go back to the members, who can donate to the party that they wish to and get rid of the terrible rhetoric that goes on. You look at the States and what they’re going through, and it’s only going to get worse, too.", "I think the whole idea of how money is used inappropriately in this province to push issues—leave it up to the individual members running in each riding, and our leaders of each party, to debate it out. Actually have true, honest debate that speaks to the issues, as opposed to relying on some third-party group to spend millions upon millions of dollars to go personally at candidates.", "I’m sorry, I think the government missed the boat on this. It has been six months since the budget. It’s electoral reforms; it’s not like we have too many electoral reform items at the Legislature. But instead, we’ve missed the boat, and we’re going to have to wait for another electoral reform. They say they’re considering it. What does that mean? There’s no action behind those words.", "I think the legislation is good. We support the legislation. We’re glad they’re taking care of northern Ontario. But they’ve missed the opportunity to make true, substantive changes to how the people of Ontario view politics and vote.", "Hopefully, they’re able to go forward and fix this legislation. Maybe in committee we can make some changes that fix it. Right now, if you did a poll of people throughout this province on what their thoughts are on politics and politicians, I bet you we’d be pretty low, with what’s going on. I mean, you look. We have a government here with four OPP investigations open against them. We have one that turned out a charge that will be going to the courts.", "I think that at the end of the day Ontarians deserve better. They deserve a government that’s in it for the people as opposed to in it for themselves. It clearly shows, when they come up with an electoral reform like Bill 115, that they’re more in the line of saying, “We’ve changed for democracy.” Well, they’ve taken a piece of legislation that the federal government took two years to create, and copied and pasted it, made the amendments to northern Ontario and passed it on, which is fine; that needed to be done. However, they’ve had more than enough time to make the changes I’ve suggested. I’m sure there are quite a few more changes that other members of this Legislature have to improve democracy in Ontario. I think that would have been the time to do so.", "I wouldn’t say this bill is being rushed, but we do have time before November 2016 to make the changes that—we could have had good discussion amongst the members to come up with a more substantive bill, something that we could have really worked at, taken around the province and come up with ideas for making Ontario a better place to vote and be a participant.", "Maybe then, at the end of the day, voter turnout would be increased, if there’s better opportunity. Maybe the younger vote would turn out more. I mean, collecting their names at 16 and 17 and sending them mailings will help. Will it help a lot? We don’t know. We don’t know what they’re going to be taking in of what they read. Maybe, perhaps, social media is the way to go, going forward.", "However, we’re hoping that, through the committee process, the government will take a look at some of the ideas we’ve put forth, and what’s coming forth from the public, and take this around Ontario. Take it into northern Ontario. Let them have their say on what they think of the ridings as they are. Take it to areas like Oak Ridges–Markham or Nepean–Carleton to hear what their concerns are with the fact that there will be multiple MPs per one MPP.", "I could just imagine the federal government coming out with an announcement, and that MPP having to attend the same announcement in three different areas of their riding, even though they’re three different MPs. That will be interesting to play out at the end of the day.", "I’m glad I’ve had the opportunity to speak to this legislation, and I look forward to the questions and comments coming forward." ],

It’s worth noting, though, that some ridings—Algoma–Manitoulin currently has 37 municipalities as part of that riding, 21 First Nations, 15 local service boards—86,000 square kilometres. This is a riding the size of France, Belgium and, for good measure, Switzerland, and it’s served by one MPP.", "With every piece of legislation that comes before us, we have the ability to comment on some of the weaknesses and the gaps in it. I think people expect people to award the government for sort of holding the line in the north, but that’s a big riding. You have to take in geography and you have to take in demographics, obviously.", "Another missed opportunity with this particular legislation is addressing the rights of the homeless. This is a growing issue. There’s a growing number of homeless people, and they still have the right to vote. Why not put it in a piece of legislation and protect their rights? What about the issues around students who do want to vote? Why don’t we make it clear what the rules of engagement are for students to cast their ballots.

When the electoral officers submitted their report around the apparent contraventions of the Election Act, this document was precedent-setting.

The reason we did that legislatively was that the previously government, the Conservative government of Mike Harris, had reduced the northern ridings from 15 down to 11. Under the last federal redistribution, had we followed that, the north would have lost one further seat. We would have gone from 11 to 10. So just to put on the record, we’ve been very strong on that. Eleven is the lowest it can go unless someone chooses to alter that particular legislation.", "I have a northern riding.

Two hours or two hours and 15 minutes to the westernmost part of my riding—seven different municipalities in the riding, local roads boards, local services boards. You service them with your constituency offices. I’ve had a constituency office in Atikokan. The other five municipalities are very close around the city of Thunder Bay; Oliver Paipoonge, O’Connor, Gillies, Conmee and Neebing are close. Atikokan’s the farthest to the west.
